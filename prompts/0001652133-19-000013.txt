Item 1. Business
Overview
Oasis Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership,” “OMP,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a growth-oriented, fee-based master limited partnership formed by its sponsor, Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE: OAS) (“Oasis Petroleum”), to own, develop, operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream assets in North America that are integral to the crude oil and natural gas operations of Oasis Petroleum and are strategically positioned to capture volumes from other producers. Our current midstream operations are performed exclusively within the Williston Basin, one of the most prolific crude oil producing basins in North America. We expect to grow acquisitively through accretive, dropdown acquisitions, organically as Oasis Petroleum continues to develop its acreage and through payments of capital contributions to our DevCos that increase our percentage interest ownership in our DevCos. Additionally, we expect to grow by offering our services to third parties and through acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. Through our entry into an Omnibus Agreement (as defined below), Oasis Petroleum has also granted us a right of first offer (“ROFO”), which converts into a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) from any successor upon a change of control of Oasis Petroleum with respect to its retained interests in two of our three development companies and any other midstream assets that Oasis Petroleum or any successor to Oasis Petroleum builds with respect to its current acreage and elects to sell in the future (the “Subject Assets”). See “Contractual arrangements with Oasis Petroleum” below.
We divide our operations into two primary areas with developed midstream infrastructure, both of which are supported by significant acreage dedications from Oasis Petroleum. In Wild Basin, Oasis Petroleum has dedicated to us approximately 65,000 acres, of which approximately 29,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage position, and in which we have the right to provide crude oil, natural gas and water services to support Oasis Petroleum’s existing and future volumes. Outside of the Wild Basin, Oasis Petroleum has dedicated to us approximately 581,000 acres for produced and flowback water services, of which approximately 299,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage. In addition, Oasis Petroleum has dedicated to us approximately 364,000 acres for freshwater services, of which approximately 203,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage. We have also received certain commitments from third parties in which we have the right to provide our full suite of midstream services to support existing and future third party volumes.
We generate substantially all of our revenues through long-term, fee-based contractual arrangements with wholly owned subsidiaries of Oasis Petroleum, as described below, which minimize our direct exposure to commodity prices. Furthermore, we do not take ownership of the crude oil or natural gas that we handle for Oasis Petroleum; however, we take ownership of natural gas under certain purchase arrangements with third parties. We believe our contractual arrangements will provide us with stable and predictable cash flows over the long-term. We have entered into 15-year, fixed-fee contracts for natural gas services (gathering, compression, processing and gas lift), crude oil services (gathering, stabilization, blending and storage), produced and flowback water services (gathering and disposal) and freshwater services (fracwater and flushwater distribution) with Oasis Petroleum and Oasis Midstream Services LLC (“OMS”). OMS is a wholly owned subsidiary of OMS Holdings LLC (“OMS Holdings”), which is the managing member of our general partner, OMP GP LLC (“General Partner”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Oasis Petroleum. We are also a party to the long-term, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulated transportation services agreement governing the transportation of crude oil via pipeline from the Wild Basin area to Johnson’s Corner, which OMS previously entered into with Oasis Petroleum Marketing LLC (“OPM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Oasis Petroleum. This agreement is renewable at OPM’s option. In addition, we have increased customer diversification by entering into numerous agreements and transactions with third parties to provide our full suite of midstream services. 
Contributed Businesses and Organizational Structure
Our assets
We operate our midstream infrastructure business through our development companies, two of which are jointly-owned with Oasis Petroleum. 
Initial public offering. On September 25, 2017, we completed the initial public offering of 7,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price to the public of $17.00 per common unit. Additionally, on 
5

October 10, 2017, we issued an additional 1,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option at the same price and on the same terms. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $134.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring fees and offering costs. We distributed $132.1 million of the net proceeds to Oasis Petroleum. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol OMP.
Contributed businesses. In connection with the initial public offering, Oasis Petroleum contributed to us a 100% ownership interest in Bighorn DevCo LLC (“Bighorn DevCo”), a 10% ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo LLC (“Bobcat DevCo”) and a 40% ownership interest in Beartooth DevCo LLC (“Beartooth DevCo” and, together with Bighorn DevCo and Bobcat DevCo, the “DevCos”). On November 19, 2018, we completed our acquisition from Oasis Petroleum of additional ownership interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo (the “Dropdown Acquisition”). The Dropdown Acquisition increased our ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo from 10% to 25% and increased our ownership interest in Beartooth DevCo from 40% to 70%. The Dropdown Acquisition was funded in part by the net proceeds from a public offering of 2,300,000 common units (including 300,000 common units issued pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units) at a purchase price to the public of $20.00 per common unit, which was completed on November 14, 2018.
The following table provides a summary of our DevCos (as of December 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated) along with our ownership of these assets.
DevCos | Areas Served | Service Lines | OMP Ownership
Bighorn DevCo | Wild Basin | –Natural gas processing–Crude oil stabilization–Crude oil blending–Crude oil and NGL storage–Crude oil transportation | 100% 
Bobcat DevCo | Wild Basin | –Natural gas gathering–Natural gas compression–Gas lift–Crude oil gathering–Produced and flowback water gathering–Produced and flowback water disposal | 25% 
Beartooth DevCo | AlgerCottonwoodHebronIndian HillsRed BankWild Basin | –Produced and flowback water gathering–Produced and flowback water disposal–Freshwater supply and distribution | 70% 

Bighorn DevCo and Bobcat DevCo. As of December 31, 2018, we own a 100% interest in Bighorn DevCo and a 25% interest in Bobcat DevCo, each of which has assets and operations in the Wild Basin operating area. Bighorn DevCo’s assets include gas processing and crude oil stabilization, blending, storage and transportation. These assets generate strong cash flows with additional growth through expansion capital expenditures, as well as organic growth expected through Oasis Petroleum’s continued development of its acreage in the Wild Basin area. Bobcat DevCo’s assets include gas gathering, compression and gas lift, crude oil gathering and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal. Bobcat DevCo’s assets are operational, but the development of these assets are mid-cycle and will require significant expansion capital expenditures over the near term. For the 2019 calendar year, we have reached an agreement with Oasis Petroleum pursuant to which we will fund up to $80 million of capital expenditures to Bobcat DevCo that Oasis Petroleum would otherwise be required to contribute, in exchange for an increased ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements). We believe our 100% ownership in Bighorn DevCo and increasing ownership in Bobcat DevCo will generate significant and stable cash flows over time. Both Bighorn DevCo and Bobcat DevCo hold assets in the Wild Basin area in McKenzie County, North Dakota, which is a key area of focus for Oasis Petroleum’s drilling and development efforts. We believe our crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing and transportation assets provide an economic advantage to Oasis Petroleum by providing critical infrastructure needed to move product to market and allow Oasis Petroleum to realize substantially better pricing realizations on its produced crude oil and natural gas. Our existing midstream infrastructure in the basin facilitates more efficient execution of Oasis Petroleum’s development plan by substantially minimizing the time necessary to connect new wells to market. In addition, we have entered into numerous agreements and transactions with third parties, which contributes to revenue growth for both Bighorn DevCo and Bobcat DevCo.
Beartooth DevCo. As of December 31, 2018, we own a 70% interest in Beartooth DevCo, which owns a significant portion of our water infrastructure assets. These assets, which gather and dispose of produced and flowback water, deliver freshwater for well completion and deliver freshwater for production optimization services, are predominately located in Oasis Petroleum’s 
6

Alger, Cottonwood, Hebron, Indian Hills and Red Bank operating areas. Additionally, we operate a freshwater distribution system in McKenzie County, North Dakota, to service a portion of Oasis Petroleum’s completion activity in that area and provide freshwater services to third parties. Substantially all of Oasis Petroleum’s dedicated acreage can be serviced by these assets given the reach of our widely dispersed infrastructure systems currently in place, which can easily service additional wells through low cost connections to areas accessible by this infrastructure. We believe our 70% interest in Beartooth DevCo provides an attractive balance of current cash generation and growth potential. Crude oil cannot be efficiently produced in the Williston Basin without significant produced and flowback water transportation and disposal capacity given the high water volumes produced alongside the crude oil. At the well site, crude oil and produced and flowback water are separated to extract the crude oil for sale and the produced and flowback water for proper disposal. We utilize our pipelines to gather produced and flowback water and move it to our disposal facilities. Utilizing gathering pipelines is demonstrably more efficient than trucking water (the predominant alternative available in the Williston Basin today) and can lead to significantly higher production uptime during periods of harsh weather.
The following are detailed descriptions of our three DevCos:
Bighorn DevCo. Bighorn DevCo has substantial midstream assets to support development in the Wild Basin area, including:

• | two natural gas processing plants with total processing capacity of 280 million standard cubic feet per day (“MMscfpd”) with enhanced propane recovery refrigeration units;


• | four mechanical refrigeration units with total capacity of 40 MMscfpd to process natural gas volumes in excess of current capacity;


• | an approximately 20-mile, 10-inch, FERC-regulated, mainline crude oil pipeline to the sales destination, Johnson’s Corner, with up to 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day (“Bopd”) of operating capacity; and


• | a crude oil blending, stabilization and storage facility with 240,000 barrels of storage capacity.

Bobcat DevCo. Bobcat DevCo has a significant midstream gathering system that continues to be developed as Oasis Petroleum and third party producers expand their drilling activities in the Wild Basin area, including:

• | approximately 40 miles of six- and eight-inch crude oil gathering pipelines with initial capacity of 50,000 Bopd, which can be expanded to 70,000 Bopd, approximately 80% of which was constructed as of December 31, 2018 and was servicing substantially all of Oasis Petroleum’s recently completed wells;


• | approximately 73 miles of eight-inch through 20-inch natural gas gathering pipelines with gathering capacity of up to 220 MMscfpd and field compression capabilities, approximately 80% of which was constructed as of December 31, 2018 and was servicing Oasis Petroleum’s and certain third party producers’ recently completed wells;


• | a natural gas lift system providing artificial lift throughout the field; and


• | a produced and flowback water gathering and disposal system, consisting of eight current disposal wells and approximately 39 miles of eight-and ten-inch pipeline with capacity of approximately 60,000 Bowpd. Approximately 80% of the produced and flowback water gathering lines and five disposal wells were completed as of December 31, 2018 and were servicing substantially all of Oasis Petroleum’s recently completed wells.

Beartooth DevCo. Beartooth DevCo has an extensive produced and flowback water gathering and freshwater distribution system that continues to be developed as Oasis Petroleum expands its drilling activities, including:

• | seven strategically located produced and flowback water gathering pipeline systems spanning approximately 384 miles that connect approximately 675 crude oil and natural gas producing wells to our disposal well sites;


• | twenty-one strategically located disposal wells that dispose of produced and flowback water from our produced and flowback water gathering pipeline systems or from third-party trucks;


• | approximately 328 miles of freshwater pipeline that connect to approximately 527 crude oil and natural gas producing wells that are widely dispersed throughout our areas of operation, allowing for expansion to new wells in these areas for completion with minimal expansion capital expenditures;


• | a freshwater distribution system, which includes four freshwater ponds, in McKenzie County, North Dakota, spanning approximately 60 miles; and


• | a centralized freshwater intake facility from the Missouri River in McKenzie County, North Dakota.

We divide our operations into two primary areas with developed midstream infrastructure, both of which are supported by significant acreage dedications from Oasis Petroleum. In Wild Basin, Oasis Petroleum has dedicated to us approximately 65,000 acres, of which approximately 29,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage position, and in which we have the right to provide crude oil, gas and water services to support Oasis Petroleum’s existing and future volumes.

Outside of Wild Basin, Oasis Petroleum has dedicated to us approximately 581,000 acres for produced and flowback water services, of which approximately 299,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage, and approximately 364,000 acres for freshwater services, of which approximately 203,000 acres are within Oasis Petroleum’s current gross operated acreage. In addition, we have received certain commitments from third parties in which we have the right to provide our full suite of midstream services to support existing and future third party volumes.
Oasis Petroleum has current acreage dedications to third parties for crude oil and natural gas services. Approximately 51,000 acres of Oasis Petroleum’s gross operated acres are not subject to dedications for natural gas services and approximately 86,000 acres of Oasis Petroleum’s gross operated acres are not subject to dedications for crude oil services. On dedicated acreage, if the third-party dedication for crude oil and natural gas midstream services lapses on currently dedicated acreage, Oasis Petroleum will have the right to dedicate that acreage to us for such services or to develop crude oil and natural gas midstream assets that would be subject to our ROFO or ROFR, as applicable, in the event Oasis Petroleum elects to sell them.

Organizational structure
The following is a simplified diagram of our ownership structure as of December 31, 2018.

Our business strategy
The primary components of our business strategy are:
Leverage Our Relationship with Oasis Petroleum. We intend to leverage our relationship with Oasis Petroleum to expand our asset base and increase our cash flows through:

• | Dropdown Acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum. As of December 31, 2018, Oasis Petroleum owns a 75% economic interest in Bobcat DevCo and a 30% economic interest in Beartooth DevCo, both of which are subject to our ROFO or ROFR, as applicable, with Oasis Petroleum or its successors. We anticipate that we will have the opportunity to make accretive acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum by acquiring the remaining equity interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. We also anticipate acquiring assets that are not currently included in the DevCos that we anticipate Oasis Petroleum will develop to support its production activities. Oasis Petroleum’s future development areas in the Williston Basin and in the Delaware Basin provide it the opportunity to develop a portion or a full suite of crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets.


• | Organic Growth. Our midstream infrastructure footprint services Oasis Petroleum’s leading acreage position in the Williston Basin. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Oasis Petroleum completed and placed on production 114 gross (79.0 net) operated Bakken and Three Forks wells, compared to 88 gross (58.3 net) operated Bakken and Three Forks wells during the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018, Oasis Petroleum incurred total capital expenditures of $2.2 billion, including midstream capital expenditures of $277.6 million. We anticipate we will be positioned to increase our throughput volumes and cash flows as Oasis Petroleum grows its production volumes through our crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our pipelines gathered approximately 90% of the produced and flowback water volumes produced from Oasis Petroleum’s operated wells and disposed of approximately 95% of the produced and flowback water volumes produced from Oasis Petroleum’s operated wells. We will seek to increase this percentage as we increase utilization on our existing pipelines and further develop our midstream infrastructure with volumes from Oasis Petroleum and third parties. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, our crude oil and natural gas pipelines gathered 59,642 Boepd produced from Oasis Petroleum’s operated wells in the Wild Basin area.

Focus on Providing Services Under Long-Term, Fixed-Fee Contracts to Mitigate Direct Commodity Price Exposure and Enhance the Stability of Our Cash Flows. We are party to 15-year contracts with Oasis Petroleum for natural gas services (gathering, compression, processing and gas lift), crude oil services (gathering, stabilization, blending and storage), produced and flowback water services (gathering and disposal) and freshwater services (fracwater and flushwater distribution). We are also a party to the long-term FERC-regulated transportation services agreement governing the transportation of crude oil via pipeline from the Wild Basin area to Johnson’s Corner. We generate substantially all of our revenues through these contracts. We have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices, and we do not take ownership of the crude oil or natural gas that we gather, compress, process, terminal, store or transport for Oasis Petroleum. Due to this and the fee-based, long-term nature of our contracts, we believe these agreements will provide us with stable and predictable cash flows. Additionally, we intend to continue to pursue long-term, fee-based contracts with third parties.
Attract Third-Party Customers. We have successfully added third party customers and expect to continue to attract incremental volumes from other upstream oil and gas operators to expand our systems and increase the utilization of our existing midstream assets. The scale of our assets and their strategic location near concentrated areas of current and expected future production make our geographic footprint difficult for competitors to replicate, thereby providing us the ability to gather incremental throughput volumes at a lower cost than new market entrants or competitors with less scale or undersized assets. We believe that our strategically located assets and our experience in designing, permitting, constructing and operating cost-efficient crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets will allow us to continue to grow our third-party business.
Complete Accretive Acquisitions from Third Parties. In addition to growing our business organically and through dropdown acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum, we intend to make accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. Leveraging our knowledge of, and expertise in, the Williston Basin, we intend to target and efficiently execute economically attractive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties within and beyond our current area of operation. We also intend to explore accretive acquisition opportunities from third parties outside of the Williston Basin in support of any geographic expansion of Oasis Petroleum’s operations.

Our competitive strengths
We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following strengths:
Our Strategic Affiliation with Oasis Petroleum. We believe that, as a result of owning a 90% controlling interest in our General Partner, which owns all of our incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”), its ownership of 67.6% of our outstanding units and its significant retained interests in two of the DevCos, Oasis Petroleum is incentivized to promote and support our growth plan and to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business as well as its retained interests in two of the DevCos. We believe our assets are highly efficient, with demonstrated high rates of availability and operational reliability designed to withstand harsh winter conditions, and can be operated at what we consider to be relatively low costs. Additionally, our assets are strategically located within Oasis Petroleum’s acreage position and are in close proximity to other operators in the Williston Basin, positioning us as a leading provider of midstream services in the Williston Basin.

• | Dropdown Acquisition Opportunities. As of December 31, 2018, Oasis Petroleum retains a 75% economic interest in Bobcat DevCo and a 30% economic interest in Beartooth DevCo, both of which are subject to our ROFO or ROFR, as applicable, with Oasis Petroleum or its successors. In addition, we believe Oasis Petroleum will continue to build crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets to support its production growth. We anticipate that we will have the opportunity to make accretive acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum by acquiring the remaining equity interests in two of our DevCos. In addition, we anticipate acquiring midstream assets that Oasis Petroleum elects to develop and sell to support its production activities in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin.


• | The Development of the Williston Basin is a Strategic Priority for Oasis Petroleum. Oasis Petroleum owns and operates an extensive and contiguous land position with a large inventory of leasehold acreage in the core areas of the Williston Basin, of which approximately 97% was held by production as of December 31, 2018. We believe we will directly benefit from Oasis Petroleum’s continued development of its Williston Basin acreage, where it serves as operator with respect to substantially all of its net wells.

Strategically Located Midstream Assets. Our midstream assets are strategically located in the Williston Basin and provide critical midstream infrastructure to Oasis Petroleum in a cost-efficient manner. We believe that the strategic location of our assets within the highly economic core of the Williston Basin, combined with our cost-advantaged midstream service offering, will enable us to continue to attract volumes from third-party operators in the basin.

• | Demand for Midstream Infrastructure Services in the Williston Basin. The Wild Basin area in McKenzie County, North Dakota is the primary area of focus for Oasis Petroleum’s drilling plan given its core location within the Williston Basin. We believe the extensive midstream infrastructure we have built and are continuing to build in this area provides a strategic footprint in the core of the Williston Basin and provides opportunities to continue to connect other third-party operators. We believe our midstream assets will continue to be able to compete for third-party business based on the cost-effective nature of our midstream services compared to the current alternatives for transportation of crude oil, natural gas and water in the Williston Basin. Additionally, due to the core location of our assets, we believe that extensive development will occur in and around our assets in the current commodity price environment, and future development activity will be highly levered to any commodity price recovery.


• | Strategically Located Near Key Demand Centers. We believe our crude oil pipeline to Johnson’s Corner provides a highly strategic takeaway alternative for operators in the core of the Williston Basin. Johnson’s Corner is a receipt point for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has significantly improved in-basin pricing realizations for producers since coming online.


• | Full-Service Operational Flexibility. In addition to our crude oil, natural gas and water gathering capabilities, our midstream assets also include crude oil blending, stabilization and storage, and a mainline FERC-regulated crude oil pipeline to the sales destination, Johnson’s Corner. In addition, we have two fully operational natural gas processing plants with approximately 280 MMscfpd natural gas processing capacity with enhanced propane recovery refrigeration units, as well as four mechanical refrigeration units with total capacity of 40 MMscfpd. Our natural gas processing plants and mechanical refrigeration units service natural gas production from both Oasis Petroleum and third parties. As production increases in the Williston Basin, our interconnected system is constructed to provide optionality, which increases our growth prospects and value proposition to additional third-party customers.

Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. We provide substantially all of our natural gas gathering, compression, processing and gas lift; crude oil gathering, stabilization, blending and storage; produced and flowback water gathering and disposal; and freshwater distribution services to Oasis Petroleum on a fixed-fee basis under 15-year contracts. Our assets are newly constructed, leading to relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which also enhances the stability of our cash flows. We believe that the operating history of Oasis Petroleum and other companies in the Williston Basin has reduced development risk and increased the predictability of future production of new wells. This operating history, combined with the structure of our commercial contracts, is expected to promote the generation of stable and predictable cash flows. Based on 
11

historical performance and operating and economic assumptions, we expect the majority of the wells within Oasis Petroleum’s estimated proved reserves in the Williston Basin as of December 31, 2018 to have producing lives in excess of 30 years.
Financial Flexibility and Strong Capital Structure. We have a balanced capital structure which, when combined with our stable and predictable cash flows, should allow us to access capital markets when they are constructive. We believe that our ownership structure, available borrowing capacity and potential ability to access the equity and debt capital markets will provide us with the financial flexibility to successfully execute our organic growth and acquisition strategies. We will seek to maintain a disciplined approach of executing and financing acquisitions and growth projects with an appropriate mix of equity and debt based on market conditions.
Experienced Management and Operating Teams with Strong Execution Track Record. Through our relationship with Oasis Petroleum, we will benefit from a significant pool of management talent, strong relationships throughout the energy industry and broad operational, technical, business development and administrative infrastructure. These professionals have significant experience building, permitting and operating assets, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, natural gas processing, produced and flowback water gathering and disposal and freshwater distribution. We believe access to these personnel will, among other things, enhance the efficiency of our operations and accelerate our growth.
Our relationship with Oasis Petroleum
Our relationship with Oasis Petroleum is one of our principal strengths. We were formed by Oasis Petroleum in 2014 and Oasis Petroleum owns, as of December 31, 2018, an aggregate 67.6% limited partner interest in us and a 90% controlling interest in our General Partner, which owns all of our IDRs and our non-economic general partner interest. As of December 31, 2018, Oasis Petroleum also indirectly owns 75% of Bobcat DevCo and 30% of Beartooth DevCo. Oasis Petroleum operates in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin. Oasis Petroleum expects its Williston Basin operations to be a large contributor to its total production, and Oasis Petroleum intends to use us as an integral vehicle to support its Williston Basin production and the primary vehicle to grow the midstream infrastructure business that supports its production activities in the basin. We believe our assets are highly efficient because they have demonstrated high rates of availability and operational reliability, are designed to withstand harsh winter conditions and can be operated at what we consider to be relatively low costs. Our produced and flowback water pipeline assets are demonstrably more efficient than trucking water, which is the predominant alternative available in the Williston Basin today. Additionally, our assets are strategically located within Oasis Petroleum’s acreage position and are in close proximity to other operators in the Williston Basin, positioning us to become a leading provider of midstream services in the Williston Basin.
We intend to expand our business through the acquisition of Oasis Petroleum’s retained interests in two of our DevCos, by increasing our percentage ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo pursuant to the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement (as defined below), the acquisition of midstream assets that Oasis Petroleum constructs, through OMS, in the Williston Basin, Delaware Basin or in any other crude oil or natural gas basins that Oasis Petroleum may pursue, through selective acquisitions of complementary assets from third parties, both within and outside of the Williston Basin and by organic growth from the increased usage of our services by Oasis Petroleum and other third parties as they continue to develop their crude oil and natural gas resources. Oasis Petroleum accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues. It is the only customer that accounts for more than 10% of our revenues and the loss of Oasis Petroleum as a customer would have a material adverse effect on us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Contractual arrangements with Oasis Petroleum
In connection with the closing of the initial public offering on September 25, 2017, we entered into the following commercial agreements with certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Oasis Petroleum.
Omnibus Agreement; Subject Assets

The Freshwater Purchase Agreement provides for an initial term of 15 years.
Crude Transportation Services Agreement
Bighorn DevCo entered into an Amendment #1 and Assignment Agreement with OPM and OMS (the “Amendment and Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to which Bighorn DevCo became a party to the long-term, fixed-fee agreement previously entered into by OPM and OMS providing for crude transportation services from the Wild Basin area to Johnson’s Corner through a FERC-regulated pipeline system that has up to 75,000 barrels per day of operating capacity and firm capacity for committed shippers. The Amendment and Assignment Agreement is renewable at OPM’s option (subject to certain limitations) and includes minimum volume commitments that are not material to the Partnership’s operating results.
Capital expenditures
In 2018, gross capital expenditures, excluding $172.4 million of expansion capital expenditures to acquire additional ownership interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo, were $272.1 million. Capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership were $116.6 million, of which $2.8 million was spent on maintenance capital expenditures and $113.8 million was spent on expansion capital expenditures. 
Our 2019 capital expenditures program, excluding acquisitions, will accommodate a gross capital expenditure level of approximately $142 million to $162 million, with approximately $131 million to $149 million attributable to the Partnership. We expect to spend approximately 6% to 8% of EBITDA for maintenance capital expenditures, which is included in our total capital expenditure program. These amounts include the capital contributions to Bobcat DevCo, pursuant to the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement (as defined below).
On February 22, 2019, we entered into a capital expenditures arrangement with Oasis Petroleum, pursuant to which we will cover up to $80 million of expansion capital expenditures associated with Oasis Petroleum’s retained interest in Bobcat DevCo, in exchange for increasing ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo (the “2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement”). The effective date of the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement was January 1, 2019. We expect our ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo to increase from 25% to between approximately 34% to 36%. The terms of the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement were approved by the Board of Directors of the General Partner following a unanimous recommendation for approval from the conflicts committee of the Board of Directors of the General Partner, which consists entirely of independent directors.
See “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
Competition
As a result of our 15-year, fixed fee commercial agreements with Oasis Petroleum, we do not compete for the portion of Oasis Petroleum’s existing operations for which we currently provide midstream infrastructure services. For areas where acreage is not dedicated to us, the DevCos will compete with similar enterprises in providing additional midstream infrastructure services in those areas of operation. Some of these competitors may expand or construct midstream infrastructure systems that would create additional competition for the services provided by the DevCos to crude oil and natural gas producers. In addition, third parties that are significant producers of crude oil and natural gas in the DevCos’ areas of operation may develop their own midstream infrastructure systems in lieu of employing the DevCos’ services.
Title to Our Properties
Substantially all of our interests in the real property on which our assets are located derive from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations, and we believe that we have satisfactory interests in and to these lands. We have leased or acquired easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses in these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets will be located, and we believe that we have satisfactory interests in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.

Seasonality
Demand for crude oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain crude oil and natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. In respect of our completed midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe weather may also impact or slow the ability of Oasis Petroleum to execute its drilling and development plan and increase operating expenses associated with repairs or anti-freezing operations.
Insurance
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates are subject to fluctuation, so future insurance coverage could increase our costs. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable, which could result in less coverage, increases in costs or higher deductibles and retentions.
Water and natural resource-related solid waste disposal involves several hazards and operational risks, including environmental damage from leaks, spills or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent to our produced and flowback water gathering and disposal business, our insurance coverage includes commercial general liability, employer’s liability, commercial automobile liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage. Coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations and is commonly excluded on such policies.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (“HLPSA”) with respect to crude oil and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (“NGPSA”) with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of crude oil and natural gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in High Consequence Areas (“HCAs”), such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. 
Legislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the Pipeline, Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In June 2016, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act (the “2016 Pipeline Safety Act”) was passed, extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practice constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address such conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment.
The adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid pipeline integrity management requirements, such as, for example, periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs, regardless of the pipeline’s 
15

proximity to a high consequence area. The final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. However, the date of implementation of this final rule by publication in the Federal Register continues to be delayed following the January 2017 change in Presidential Administrations. In a second example, in March 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as 5 dwellings within a potential impact area; requiring natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures (“MAOP”); and requiring certain onshore and offshore gathering lines in Class I areas to comply with damage prevention, corrosion control, public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning standards. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA’s integrity management requirements for natural gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines. PHMSA split this proposed rule into three separate rulemaking proceedings and is expected to finalize those proceedings in 2019. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our crude oil gathering and transportation, natural gas gathering and processing, and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the handling, discharge or disposal of materials and wastes, and the protection of natural resources and the environment. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) customers’ operations, including, among other things, the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from operations; a limitation on the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with operations; a restriction on the way wastes are handled or disposed; a limitation or prohibition on activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; the imposition of investigatory and remedial actions to prevent or mitigate pollution conditions caused by operations or attributable to former operations; the imposition of specific safety and health standards addressing worker protections; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. Numerous governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and analogous state agencies, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays, or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, loss of leases and the issuance of injunctions limiting some or all of our operations in a particular area.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any new laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly midstream management activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Additionally, accidental spills or other releases may occur in the course of our operations and we cannot be sure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
Moreover, our E&P customers are also subject to these same laws and regulations. Any changes in environmental laws could limit our customers’ businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our gathering, transportation, processing and disposal services and adversely impact our business. While compliance with some environmental laws and regulations creates a need for assets such as our own, other environmental laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our services. For instance, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of produced and flowback water generated by crude oil and natural gas development and production activities. If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some produced and flowback water to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject 
16

and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, non-hazardous wastes, hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have caused or contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we handle materials that may be regulated as hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes. 
We also generate and accept for disposal from our E&P customers wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. RCRA regulates the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, but it imposes more stringent requirements on the management of hazardous wastes. In the course of our or our customers’ operations, some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes are generated that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Most E&P waste, if properly handled, is exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. However, it is possible that certain E&P waste now classified as non-hazardous waste and exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. For example, pursuant to a consent decree issued by a federal district court, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D regulations that could result in E&P wastes being regulated as hazardous wastes, or sign a determination that revision of those RCRA regulations is unnecessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised crude oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. If the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified, we and our customers could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
We currently own, lease, or operate upon a number of properties that have been used for crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production support-service activities for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be material.
In the course of our operations, some of our storage and process vessels, piping work areas and other equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive material (“NORM”) associated with crude oil and natural gas production. NORM-contaminated scale deposits and other accumulations exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage and process vessels, piping and work areas affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. As a result of our operations we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
17

Subsurface Injections
Our produced and flowback water underground injection operations are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. States may add more stringent restrictions on the operation of injection wells when a permit is renewed or amended, which may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Also, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of produced and flowback water. If such laws are passed, our E&P customers may divert some produced and flowback water to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities, which reduces the demand for our services. In addition, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the produced and flowback water injection process may impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the crude oil was transferred fails to manage and dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
There exists a growing concern amongst the public and federal and state agencies that the injection of produced and flowback water into belowground disposal wells may trigger seismic activity. In response to these concerns, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Also, regulators in some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, additional requirements related to seismic safety, including the permitting of disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells, which has resulted in some states restricting, suspending or shutting down the use of such injection wells. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to dispose of produced and flowback water gathered from Oasis Petroleum and our other third-party E&P customers, such as by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could reduce the demand for our produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the United States and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States, and individual permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture or leak.
 The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”). The EPA and the Corps published a final rule in 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands. The rule has been challenged in federal district court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been enjoined in twenty-eight states, including North Dakota and Montana, where we or our E&P customers conduct operations, pending resolution of the legal challenges. In July 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rule and, in February 2018, the agencies published a final rule adding a February 6, 2020 applicable date to the 2015 rule. The February 2018 rule extending the 2015 final rule’s date of applicability is currently subject to litigation. Also, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, for which the agencies will seek public comment. As a result of these developments, future implementation of the rule is uncertain at this time but to the extent any rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, our operations as well as our E&P customers’ drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
The primary federal law related specifically to crude oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which establishes strict, joint and several liability for certain responsible parties in connection to releases of crude oil into waters of the United States. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of certain crude oil and natural gas facilities that handle certain quantities of crude oil, including the preparation of crude oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an crude 
18

oil spill. If a release of crude oil into the waters of the United States occurred, we could be liable for clean-up costs and various damages under the OPA.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us or our E&P customers to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain crude oil and natural gas-related projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to restrict, delay or cancel the expansion of our projects as well as our customers’ development of crude oil and natural gas projects. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
Recently, there has been increased regulation with respect to air emissions resulting from the crude oil and natural gas sector. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” “unclassifiable” or “non-attainment” and, in November 2018, issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQs. State implementation of these revised standards for ground-level ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. 
Climate Change
Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration by states or groupings of states of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes and GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. 
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction under Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards for those emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including specified onshore and offshore production facilities and onshore processing, transmission and storage facilities. The EPA has amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the crude oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from crude oil and natural gas operations. In 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the crude oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand the NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements previously issued by the EPA in 2012, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. In June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 standards for two years but the rule was not finalized. Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Furthermore, in November 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaking from crude oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the new requirements of the November 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM’s prior approach to venting and flaring but the rule rescinding the November 2016 final rule has been challenged in federal court and remains pending. These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the crude oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. 
Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement in Paris, France (“Paris Agreement”) for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United 
19

Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process beginning when the agreement took effect in November 2016. 
The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our E&P customers’ equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs, adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas we handle or produced and flowback water we gather and dispose of and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other studies by the private sector project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities.
Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our E&P customers’ operations and reduce demand for our services. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, including crude oil and natural gas, from low permeability formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Our E&P customers regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of their operations. 
Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies but several federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities to the extent involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act; and in June 2016, published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional crude oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in 2015, the BLM published a final rule establishing new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in December 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM’s decision was filed in federal District Court in January 2018 and remains pending. 
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including the underground disposal of fluids or propping agents associated with such fracturing activities and the disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, a number of states, including North Dakota and Montana, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations imposing new permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could impose moratoriums or elect to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, similar to the approach taken by the State of New York. Also, local governments could seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
If new or more stringent laws or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the federal, state or local levels, our E&P customers’ fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements, reporting requirements, operational restrictions, permitting delays or additional costs. Any such laws or regulations could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable and reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that our customers are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities, and thus significantly affect our business. Such laws and regulations could also materially increase our cost of business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed, which could have an indirect adverse impact on the demand for our produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services.
National Environmental Policy Act
Crude oil and natural gas E&P activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or a more detailed environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through 
20

comments, which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying, limiting or prohibiting the permitting and development of projects or performance of midstream services, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and comparable state laws restrict crude oil and natural gas-related activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Birds Treaty Act. To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws live in the areas where our operations and our E&P customers’ operations are conducted, our and our customers’ abilities to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or could force us or our customers to incur significant additional costs. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for crude oil and natural gas development. In addition, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”), the agency is required to make numerous determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to set timelines. For example, in 2015, the FWS listed the northern long-eared bat, whose range includes North Dakota and parts of Montana, as a threatened species under the ESA. The designation of previously undesignated species as endangered or threatened could cause us to incur additional costs or cause our customers’ operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in affected areas, which developments could reduce demand for our gathering, transportation, processing and disposal services.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. In addition, OSHA’s implementation of the hazard communications standard, the EPA’s implementation of community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes. Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil or criminal fines and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
Other Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The crude oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the crude oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs with applicable laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations; however, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may occur and, thus, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Additionally, environmental incidents such as spills or other releases may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the crude oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may be finalized and become effective.

Regulation of Transportation of Crude Oil
Only the crude oil transportation system connecting the Wild Basin area to the Johnson’s Corner market center transports crude oil in interstate commerce. FERC regulates interstate crude oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 as modified by the Elkins Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules promulgated under those laws. In general, interstate crude oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for crude oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index, without making a cost of service filing. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC crude oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1, and our Bighorn DevCo Johnson’s Corner line will utilize the FERC crude oil index beginning on July 1, 2022. Every five years, FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. Most recently, on December 17, 2015, FERC established a new price index for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, in which common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 1.23%.
On March 15, 2018, in a set of related issuances, FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that, among other things and with respect to crude oil and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, the pipeline is required to reflect the impacts to its cost of service from the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. This information will be used by FERC in its next five-year review of the crude oil pipeline index to generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021, thereby including the effect of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the determination of indexed rates prospectively, effective July 1, 2021. FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate crude oil pipeline index, is based on many components, and tax-related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect FERC’s determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on FERC’s application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five-year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates in the future, including indexed rates.
Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit a regulated pipeline’s ability to charge rates until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms.
A successful rate challenge could result in a regulated pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect, if any. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a regulated pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. We may also be required to respond to requests for information from government agencies, including compliance audits conducted by FERC.
Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
Historically, the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
22

Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting our Industry 
Energy Policy Act of 2005. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. EPAct 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,269,500 per day for violations of the NGA, adjusted annually for inflation, and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,269,500 per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rule makes it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. The anti-manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
State Regulation
States regulate the drilling for crude oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of crude oil and natural gas resources. For example, in 2014, the North Dakota Department Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) adopted Order No. 24665 (the “2014 Order”), pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of natural gas produced in the state between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2020. Modification of the 2014 Order by the NDIC in late 2015 resulted in revised gas capture percentage goals of 88% and 91% required to be achieved by November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Recently, in November 2018, the NDIC considered revising its 2018 and 2020 gas capture percentage goals but elected to retain those standards; however, the NDIC revised the flaring program’s policy goals such that the crude oil and gas exploration and production industry has more flexibility in removing certain gas volumes from consideration in calculating compliance with the state’s gas capture percentage goals. The NDIC continues to adhere to other aspects of the modified 2014 Order, including development of Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency’s gas capture percentage goals. Also, wells must continue to meet or exceed the NDIC’s gas capture percentage goals on a per-well, per-field, county or statewide basis. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficient rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells shall not exceed 100 barrels of crude oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider flexibility to these production restrictions, by means of temporary exemptions, for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect of such flexibility is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this policy in the event an operator not meeting the gas capture percentage goals fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. To the extent that our customers attempt to, but cannot comply with these gas capture requirements, those customers could incur increased compliance costs or restrictions on future production, which development could reduce demand for our services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our unitholders that they will not do so in the future. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
