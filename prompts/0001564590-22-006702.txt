 Item 1. Business
 Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “MannKind,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to MannKind Corporation and its subsidiaries.
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of inhaled therapeutic products for patients with endocrine and orphan lung diseases. Our lead product is Afrezza (insulin human) Inhalation Powder, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in June 2014. Afrezza is an ultra rapid-acting inhaled insulin indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 37.3 million people in the United States had diabetes in 2019. Globally, the International Diabetes Federation has estimated that approximately 537 million adults had diabetes in 2021 and approximately 783 million will have diabetes by 2045. 
 Afrezza consists of a dry powder formulation of human insulin delivered from a small portable inhaler. Administered at the beginning of a meal, Afrezza dissolves rapidly upon inhalation to the lung and delivers insulin quickly to the bloodstream. The first measurable effects of Afrezza occur approximately 12 minutes after administration.
 In the U.S., we are solely responsible for the commercialization of Afrezza. Our sales representatives promote Afrezza to endocrinologists and selected primary care physicians located throughout the United States. Our sales efforts are aided by support programs, such as our AfrezzaAssist program that helps patients and physicians navigate through access, reimbursement and training questions, and savings programs, such as our co-pay assistance program for patients with commercial insurance and our cash pay program for patients with no insurance. Outside of the U.S., our strategy has been to establish regional partnerships in foreign jurisdictions where there are commercial opportunities, subject to the receipt of necessary foreign regulatory approvals. Our partner in Brazil, Biomm S.A. (“Biomm”), commenced commercialization of Afrezza in January 2020. Our partner in India, Cipla Ltd. (“Cipla”), is currently conducting a clinical study of Afrezza in order to meet the requirements for a regulatory submission to the Drug Controller General of India.
 As part of the approval of Afrezza, the FDA required us to conduct certain additional clinical studies of Afrezza in pediatric patients. In the third quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Afrezza in combination with basal insulin versus multiple daily injections of insulin in children and adolescents aged 4-17 who are living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.  This study, known as the INHALE-1 study, is a 26-week open-label, randomized clinical trial with a 26-week extension period. The primary endpoint is change in HbA1c level after 26 weeks. Secondary endpoints include change in fasting plasma glucose after 26 weeks, and rate of hypoglycemic events. We do not expect to complete the INHALE-1 study until 2023 at the earliest.
 When Afrezza was approved, the FDA also required us to conduct a five-year, randomized, controlled trial in 8,000-10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes to assess the long-term safety of Afrezza. In discussions with the FDA during 2021, the agency indicated that this requirement could potentially be satisfied through a retrospective analysis or a prospective registry study rather than a randomized controlled trial.  The details of such a modified requirement will be elaborated in further discussions with the FDA that are planned for later in 2022.
 Afrezza utilizes our proprietary Technosphere formulation technology, which we believe represents a versatile drug delivery platform that may allow the oral inhalation of a wide range of active pharmaceutical ingredients. We have successfully prepared Technosphere formulations of anionic and cationic drugs, hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, proteins, peptides and small molecules. Technosphere powders are based on our proprietary excipient, fumaryl diketopiperazine (“FDKP”), which is a pH-sensitive organic molecule that self-assembles into small particles under acidic conditions. Certain drugs can be loaded onto these particles by combining a solution of the drug with a solution or suspension of Technosphere material, which is then dried to powder form. The resulting powder has a consistent and narrow range of particle sizes with good aerodynamic properties that enable efficient delivery deep into the lungs. Technosphere powders dissolve quickly when the particles contact the moist lung surface with its neutral pH, releasing the drug molecules to diffuse across a thin layer of cells into the arterial circulation, bypassing the liver to provide excellent systemic exposure.
 We have also created an innovative line of breath-powered, dry powder inhalers. Our inhalers are easy to use, cost-effective and can be produced in both a reusable (chronic treatment) and a single-use (acute treatment) format. Both the reusable and single-use inhaler formats use the same internal air-flow design. Being breath-powered, our inhalers require only the patient’s inhalation effort to deliver the powder. To administer the inhalation powder, a patient loads a cartridge into our inhaler and inhales through the mouthpiece. Upon inhalation, the dry powder is lifted out of the cartridge and broken up (or de-agglomerated) into small particles. The inhalers are engineered to produce an aggressive airstream that de-agglomerates the powder while keeping the powder moving relatively slowly. This slow-moving powder effectively navigates the patient’s airways to reach the deep lung with minimal deposition at the back of the throat. Our inhalers show very little change in performance (i.e., efficient cartridge emptying) over a wide range of inhalation efforts.
 Using our formulation and inhaler technology, we advanced an inhaled formulation of treprostinil Technosphere into clinical development in June 2018. In September 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “UT License Agreement”) with United Therapeutics Corporation (“United Therapeutics” or “UT”), pursuant to which UT assumed responsibility for global development, regulatory and commercial activities with respect to a product that UT has branded as Tyvaso DPI, while we retained responsibility for manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies. In April 2021, United Therapeutics submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA seeking approval of Tyvaso DPI for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with 
 6


interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD). In October 2021, the FDA provided UT with a complete response letter (CRL) in which it declined to approve the Tyvaso DPI NDA, citing an open inspection issue at a third-party analytical testing facility for the treprostinil drug substance as the single deficiency preventing approval of Tyvaso DPI. The CRL noted, but did not cite as a deficiency, that the FDA had not yet completed its review of a citizen petition submitted to the FDA in July 2021 concerning the safety of an excipient in Tyvaso DPI. In December 2021, UT resubmitted the NDA to the FDA, addressing the single deficiency cited in the CRL. In January 2022, the FDA accepted the resubmitted NDA for review, and designated it as a class 1 resubmission with an expected two-month review period ending in February 2022. In mid-February 2022, the FDA requested additional information from UT concerning the pulmonary safety of Tyvaso DPI related to the citizen petition. UT promptly responded to the FDA’s request. The FDA subsequently indicated that the response constitutes a major amendment to the Tyvaso DPI NDA, which extends to May 2022 the FDA’s deadline to complete its review of the pending NDA.
In December 2020, we acquired QrumPharma, Inc., a privately held pharmaceutical company developing inhalation treatments for severe chronic and recurrent pulmonary infections, including nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease.  The lead program from this acquisition (MNKD-101) is an inhaled, nebulized formulation of clofazimine, which could potentially provide several clinical advantages over the current solid oral dosage form of this drug. MNKD-101 is currently being evaluated in an initial clinical study in Australia. The FDA has designated MNKD-101 as both an orphan drug and a qualified infectious disease product for the treatment of pulmonary NTM infections. In addition to continuing the development of MNKD-101, we are evaluating the feasibility of developing a dry-powder formulation of clofazimine using our Technosphere technology.
 We have formulated other drugs and biologics for the treatment of orphan lung disease and plan to continue their development as dictated by the results achieved in preclinical studies and by resource requirements. We have also partnered with several third parties that have proprietary rights to certain compounds in order to evaluate the feasibility of developing dry-powder formulations of such compounds. We may seek to convert certain of these exploratory programs into full development programs funded by the external parties.  
 To aid in the development of oral inhalation products, we have created a number of innovative tools, including a novel inhalation profiling apparatus, known as BluHale that uses miniature sensors to assess the drug delivery process at the level of an individual inhaler. The BluHale apparatus provides real-time data regarding patient usage and delivery system performance that is transmitted to a user interface, such as a smartphone application. During 2020, we released a BluHale Professional version of the apparatus for use as a training tool in certain physician’s offices. A consumer version of the apparatus, with additional features, is in development.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We use our Danbury, Connecticut facility to formulate both the Afrezza and Tyvaso DPI inhalation powders, fill plastic cartridges with the powders and package the cartridges into blister packs. We utilize a contract packager to assemble the final kits of Afrezza and Tyvaso DPI cartridges along with inhalers and package inserts. 
 The quality management systems of our Danbury facility have been certified to be in conformance with the ISO 13485:2016 standard. Our facility is inspected on a regular basis by the FDA, most recently in July 2021 when the FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection related to Tyvaso DPI and a GMP inspection related to Afrezza. The FDA made one observation during its most recent inspection, which we corrected and addressed with the FDA following the site visit. We were also inspected by the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (“ANVISA”) (Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency) in May 2018. ANVISA renewed its certificate in 2020 on the basis of a virtual inspection. The FDA and other foreign jurisdictions are expected to conduct additional inspections of our facility from time to time.
 We believe that our Danbury facility has enough capacity to satisfy the current demand for Afrezza and, if approved, Tyvaso DPI. In addition, we are currently expanding production capacity with additional filling lines and other equipment in order to meet the demand for Tyvaso DPI projected by UT over the next several years. The costs of this expansion project are being borne by UT.  
 Currently, the only source of insulin that we have qualified for Afrezza is manufactured by Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals S.A.S. (“Amphastar”). In April 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Amphastar (as amended, the “Insulin Supply Agreement”) to purchase certain annual minimum quantities with an aggregate purchase commitment of €120.1 million over a term that currently extends through December 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2021, there was $82.8 million remaining in aggregate purchase commitments under this agreement. See additional information in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the Insulin Supply Agreement.
 The treprostinil used to produce Tyvaso DPI is supplied to us at no cost by United Therapeutics.
 Currently, we purchase FDKP, the primary component of our Technosphere powders, from a major chemical manufacturer with facilities in Europe and North America. 
 We have a supply agreement with the contract manufacturer that produces the plastic-molded parts for our inhaler and the corresponding cartridges. We expect to be able to qualify an additional vendor of plastic-molding contract manufacturing services, if warranted by demand. We assemble the inhalers at our Connecticut facility.
 We also have an agreement with the contractor that performs the final packaging of Afrezza overwraps, inhalers and printed material into patient kits. We expect to be able to qualify an additional vendor of packaging services, if warranted by demand.

The BluHale device is assembled for us by a contract manufacturer using components that are sourced from multiple vendors.
 In general, our suppliers and contract manufacturers are sophisticated and mature organizations, often with multinational operations, that have significant experience with pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing. Our quality and manufacturing personnel conduct extensive inspections to qualify new vendors and periodic GMP audits of their operations on an ongoing basis. With the expansion of our supply chain into the electronic components that are required for BluHale devices, we have begun to require our vendors to confirm that conflict minerals are not knowingly or intentionally added during the manufacturing process for, or are unnecessary to the functionality or production of, the components that we source from such vendors.  
 Intellectual Property
 Our success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue enforcing our intellectual property rights, effectively maintain our trade secrets and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to file patent applications on what we deem to be important technological developments that might relate to our product candidates or methods of using our product candidates and to seek intellectual property protection for all inventions in the United States, Europe, Japan and, depending on the nature of the invention, selected other jurisdictions. We have obtained, are seeking, and will continue to seek patent protection on the compositions of matter, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes flowing from our research and development efforts.
 Our Technosphere drug delivery platform, including Afrezza, enjoys patent protection relating to the powder, its manufacture, its use for pulmonary delivery of drugs as well as protection related to our inhalers and associated cartridges. We have additional patent coverage relating to methods for the treatment of diabetes using Afrezza. Overall, Afrezza is protected by approximately 640 issued patents in the United States and selected jurisdictions around the world, the longest-lived of which will expire in 2032. We also have over 65 applications pending that may provide additional protection for Afrezza if and when they are allowed. Similarly, Tyvaso DPI is protected by approximately 400 issued patents in the United States and elsewhere and an additional 50 pending applications. The longest-lived patent protection for Tyvaso DPI will expire in 2035. Our entire portfolio consists of approximately 1,100 issued patents and approximately 170 patent applications that provide protection for MNKD-101, our drug delivery platform, Technosphere-based products, our BluHale inhalation-profiling apparatus and various development tools. We expect to file further patent applications as our research and development efforts continue.
 The field of pulmonary drug delivery is crowded and a substantial number of patents have been issued in these fields. In addition, because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of issued patents cannot be confidently predicted. Further, there can be substantial delays in commercializing pharmaceutical products, which can partially consume the statutory period of exclusivity through patents. For some of our inventions, particularly manufacturing processes and improvements, we have chosen to rely on trade secrets and know-how, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position.
 We use trademarks and service marks to protect our corporate brand as well as the branding associated with Afrezza, our Technosphere formulation technology, our device platform and the product support programs that we have developed. Our current portfolio consists of 178 registered trademarks and 60 applications in the U.S. and selected foreign jurisdictions. We routinely monitor competing trademarks and, when necessary, oppose marks that we believe would be confusing to consumers. We also enforce against the unauthorized use or misappropriation of our marks.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research and development efforts. We compete with companies, including major global pharmaceutical companies, and other institutions that have substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling biopharmaceutical products. We face competition based on, among other things, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, product ease of use and price.
Diabetes Treatments
 We believe that Afrezza has important competitive advantages in the delivery of insulin when compared with currently known alternatives. However, new drugs or further developments in alternative drug delivery methods may provide greater therapeutic benefits, or comparable benefits at a lower cost, than Afrezza. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not introduce products or processes competitive with or superior to our product candidates.
 Currently, we believe that Afrezza has a unique “ultra rapid-acting” pharmacokinetic profile, i.e., entering the bloodstream in less than one minute, with the first measurable effects occurring approximately 12 minutes after administration, and peak glucose-lowering effects within 35 or 45 minutes after administration of a 4 or 12 unit dose, respectively. There are several formulations of “rapid-acting” insulin analogs that reach their maximum glucose-lowering effect within one to three hours after injection. The principal products in this category are insulin lispro, which is marketed by Eli Lilly & Company as Humalog® and by Sanofi S.A. as Admelog®; insulin aspart, which is marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S as Novolog® ; and insulin glulisine, which is marketed by Sanofi S.A. as Apidra®. New formulations of two of these 
 8


products – Fiasp®, a version of insulin aspart from Novo Nordisk, and Lyumjev™, a version of insulin lispro from Eli Lilly & Company – have been positioned by their manufacturers as fast(er) insulins. According to prescribing information, these products have their first measurable effects within 17-30 minutes after administration and reach peak glucose-lowering effects after 90-120 minutes.
 Inhaled Drug Delivery Systems
 Our drug delivery platform competes with other inhaled delivery systems, including AER-901 being developed by Aerami Therapeutics. AER-901 is a formulation of imatinib, administered with a small handheld electronic inhaler that is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon the research, clinical development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, shipping, approval, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of medical devices and new drug and biologic products. In addition, to the extent that our products are marketed abroad, they are also subject to export requirements and to regulation by foreign governments. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, hold letters on clinical research, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspension of production or injunctions, refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the United States, refusals of the FDA to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications, civil or criminal fines or other penalties.
 With an approved product such as Afrezza, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including post marketing study commitments or requirements, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, submitting periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements. All manufacturing sites are subject to inspection by the FDA and other national regulatory bodies and must comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), quality system regulations for medical devices (“QSR”) and other requirements enforced by these regulatory bodies. As a result, our drug-manufacturing facility in Connecticut is subject to federal registration and listing requirements and, if applicable, to state licensing requirements and so too are the facilities of our insulin supplier and the supplier(s) of FDKP. Likewise, the supplier of our inhaler and cartridges is subject to QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process of medical devices, among other requirements. A failure, including those of our suppliers, to obtain and maintain applicable federal registrations or state licenses, or to meet the inspection criteria of the FDA or the other national regulatory bodies, would disrupt our manufacturing processes and would harm our business. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance. 
 In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote drugs, which include, among other requirements, standards for and regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet, and restrictions on off-label promotion. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter requirements for corrective advertising to healthcare providers, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
 Products manufactured in the United States and marketed outside the United States are subject to certain FDA regulations, as well as regulation by the country in which the products are to be sold. We are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are studied or marketed abroad. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries usually must be obtained prior to the marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Pricing and Reimbursement
 Government coverage and reimbursement policies both directly and indirectly affect our ability to successfully commercialize our approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations that provide healthcare coverage, generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for covered drugs. In particular, in the United States, private third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and other third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. Recently, in the United States there has been heightened governmental scrutiny of the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Pricing pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, “PPACA”), which was enacted in March 2010. In the years since the PPACA was enacted, there have been a number of executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA.  While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA have been signed into law. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”), includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Subsequently, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled in December 2018 that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Ultimately, in June 2021 the Supreme Court dismissed this challenge to the constitutionality of the PPACA, so it remains in effect in its current form.  However, in the future, there are likely to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. health care system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Moreover, in the United States, there have been several presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future.  Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional government action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Health Care Fraud and Abuse and Transparency Laws
 If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, we must comply with, among others, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, and similar state laws. Similarly, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
 The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
 In addition, federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act within PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to (i) report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and 
 10


nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and (ii) report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In 2020, we reported approximately $383,700 in payments to physicians under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which consisted of $216,140 in speaking fees, $121,740 in meals, $31,600 in consulting fees and $14,220 in other payments. We also reported approximately $294,190 in research payments to teaching hospitals. Our report for payments to physicians and teaching hospitals for 2021 is due to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) by March 31, 2022.  
 Many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payer. Additional state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program, comply with industry’s compliance guidelines and relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and register pharmaceutical sales representatives and limit expenditure for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. In addition, certain state and local laws require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states; register pharmaceutical sales representatives, and report pricing with respect to certain drug products.
 Privacy
 We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 State laws also govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) imposes obligations on covered businesses. These obligations include, but are not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). Although the CCPA exempts some data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA may increase compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we maintain about California residents. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. Additionally, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CPRA, which could increase the risk of enforcement. Other states have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
 Foreign data privacy and security laws impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures that are intended to bring non-EU companies under the data security and privacy legal framework specified in the regulation. We anticipate that over time we may expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, including potentially conducting preclinical and clinical trials. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the EU GDPR. 
 Other regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, controlled drug substances, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control.
 We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Ethical Business Practices and Sustainability
 Ethical Marketing
 We require that our employees abide by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our policy on interactions with healthcare professionals and patients, U.S. federal and state laws and applicable foreign laws. We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of patients by ensuring that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our products is understood and communicated thoroughly and accurately to patients, physicians and global health authorities.
 Our policy on interactions with healthcare professionals and patients requires that our employees promote our products fairly, truthfully, accurately and on-label.  Off-label promotion of our products is explicitly prohibited, as are sales activities that would interfere with a healthcare provider’s independent medical judgment or the doctor-patient relationship. All sales staff received compliance training upon hire and on an annual basis. We also routinely monitor sales calls. We expect that consistent enforcement of, and training on, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our policy on interactions with healthcare professionals and patients will help us to avoid the incidence of unethical marketing practices.
 As part of our commitment to patient support and education, our employees and consultants may attend and participate in certain patient events, such as health fairs or local disease awareness and advocacy events.  In all cases, interactions with patients and patient groups may only be conducted in settings that are suitable for patient education and separate from the usual place(s) of clinical business of healthcare providers or institutions. In addition, our sponsorship of such events, if any, must be clearly disclosed through prominent signage.
 Drug Safety
 The safety of our products at all stages – from clinical trials to the administration and use and through to safe disposal – is a key area of attention for us. We manufacture our approved and investigational products in accordance with the applicable cGMPs, QSR and other requirements enforced by the FDA and other regulatory bodies that have oversight over our products. We acknowledge, however, that there are inherent risks associated with the use of drug products. We attempt to minimize these through stringent adherence to quality control procedures and proactive recall processes whenever a safety concern is identified. To date, we have not issued a recall for any product.
 In addition, all sales packs of Afrezza that are placed in the distribution chain are serialized in accordance with the requirements of the Drug Quality and Security Act, which requires drug manufacturers to assign a unique identifier to each sales pack (and each aggregate of such sales pack, such as a case or pallet). These identifiers remain on such pack or aggregate through the whole supply chain until its consumption or destruction. This system is intended to improve detection and removal of drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful from the drug supply chain.
 All of our employees are required to adhere to a standard operating procedure for capturing and reporting adverse events, safety information, and product complaints/adverse incidents involving any drug products marketed by us. These reports, as well as those that are collected by our third-party call center, are evaluated, processed and reported to regulatory authorities in accordance with FDA regulations and guidance on the post-marketing reporting of adverse experiences involving drugs, medical devices and combination products.
 Safety of Clinical Trial Participants
 When we are actively conducting clinical trials, the safety of our clinical trials plays a crucial role in the development of new products and our continuing prosperity. We take numerous steps to maximize the safety of our clinical trial participants.
 The health of subjects in clinical trials is a priority for us and we are committed to conducting clinical trials according to uniformly high ethical standards. We apply those standards to trials that we sponsor and conduct directly as well as those conducted on our behalf by clinical research organizations. We conduct trials in accordance with all applicable laws, the standards of International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guidelines and following the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 We require that a three-stage informed consent process be implemented in all trials to ensure that participants understand the risks and benefits of the procedures, how personal medical data is collected and used, and that participation in the trial is voluntary, among other information. We retain documentation that all participants in our trials have provided informed consent.
 We monitor clinical trials through audits and inspections conducted by us and by clinical research organizations (CROs) that we engage. We also inspect our CROs prior to, and during, an engagement. These inspections verify that our policies, good clinical practices and applicable laws are being adhered to.
 Our ability to ensure the safety of clinical trial participants is critical to securing regulatory approval and continued product development success. Moreover, our inability to conduct safe and effective clinical trials could increase our development costs over time. We will continue to hold ourselves to high standards in our oversight and management of clinical trials.

Our policy is to disclose the basic results of all clinical trials that we conduct to test the effectiveness of investigational drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions (i.e., phase 2-4 clinical studies).  Additionally, we may voluntarily disclose the results of initial safety studies (i.e., phase 1 clinical studies).  We strive to disclose these results within one year of study completion or within 30 days of marketing authorization approval.  In our disclosure of clinical trial results, our policy is to include all serious adverse events and those non-serious adverse events that have a frequency of at least five percent.  
 Corruption and Bribery
 Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that we expect of every employee, officer and director. All new employees are trained on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and existing employees are required to acknowledge annually that they have refreshed their familiarity with the policies contained within it.  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics includes clear guidelines on anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices. In addition, we have adopted a separate anti-corruption policy. Currently, we have very limited operations outside the United States; however, as we expand our global reach through collaborations or through our own growth, we acknowledge that certain regions may pose a higher risk for corrupt practices. We intend to continue our internal training programs and oversight over collaborators on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and other unethical practices in order to reduce these risks.
 Bribing healthcare professionals to use or recommend our products can create adverse publicity and damage our ability to use a critical channel of influence. We have adopted and implemented PhRMA’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals as part of our policy on interactions with healthcare professionals and patients. We believe that training on, and enforcement of, these codes will limit the incidence of unethical interactions between our personnel and healthcare professionals.
 Long-Lived Assets
 Our long-lived assets are located in the United States and totaled $36.6 million and $25.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Employees and Human Capital
 Our human capital helps us develop and commercialize new products, conduct clinical trials and navigate government regulations. Our ability to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled talent is a significant determinant of our success. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics codifies our commitment to diversity and to providing equal opportunity and a positive working environment in all aspects of employment. We also have policies setting forth our expectations for nondiscrimination and a harassment-free work environment. Specifically, our policy is that no aspect of employment, including hiring and promotional opportunities, will be subject to unlawful discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) based on race, creed, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender (including pregnancy, breastfeeding or medical conditions related to pregnancy or breastfeeding), age, physical or intellectual disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, gender stereotyping, marital status, military or veteran status, citizenship, genetic characteristic or information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local law. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 349 total at-will employees, of which 348 were full-time. Of our full-time employees, 147 were engaged in manufacturing, 41 in research and development, 50 in general and administrative and 110 in selling and marketing. Seventeen of these employees had a Ph.D. degree and/or M.D. degree and were engaged in activities relating to research and development, manufacturing, quality assurance or business development. As of December 31, 2021, our workforce was distributed along genders and ethnic minorities as follows:
 
 
Grade Levels | Number | | Female (%) | | Ethnic minority (%) | 
------------------------------------------------+--------+-----+------------+-----+---------------------+----
Vice President and above | | 14 | | 21% | | 14%
Executive Director, Director and Senior Manager | | 97 | | 44% | | 28%
Managers and below | | 238 | | 43% | | 43%
All employees | | 349 | | 43% | | 38%

 
None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good. In managing our business, we monitor several human capital measures, including:
  
• | performance against a set of specified corporate objectives for each calendar year, some of which are milestone-based, such as achieving deliverables under our collaboration agreements, and some of which are quantitative, such as achieving target net sales of Afrezza. These objectives are intended to stretch employees and serve as development opportunities but also form the basis for our incentive compensation programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | churn rate – the number of new hires and terminations each month as a percentage of the employee base – as well as the number of regrettable losses. These metrics help us to identify areas within the company where there may be a need for greater management attention and intervention.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | responses to periodic employee surveys, which are designed to give us insight into employees’ perception of company culture and areas where management’s efforts are perceived positively or negatively as well as open-ended feedback in the form of anonymous comments and questions. We strive to conduct employee surveys approximately every six months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We offer our employees a portfolio of rewards (our “Total Rewards Program”) to recruit and retain a high level of talent across the Company. Our Total Rewards program is offered to each employee and currently consists of the seven components:
  
• | Base salary – We offer a market-competitive base salary.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual bonus program – We offer quarterly sales incentive bonuses to our sales force and annual bonuses to the remainder of our employees.

• | Paid time off program – In addition to the paid time off that is accrued throughout the year, we offer paid holidays, including two week-long company shutdowns in July and December.

• | Employee Recognition Program – We provide a company-wide Spot and Peer to Peer Recognition Program to more directly reward performance and behaviors and drive cultural improvement.

 The majority of our employees are essential workers involved in the production of medicine for chronic diseases. As such, they cannot work remotely and must perform their job duties in our Connecticut facility according to a 24/7 shift schedule. Other employees have work responsibilities that can be performed somewhat asynchronously and in different locations. For such employees, our general preference is that in-office employees be in the office during core business hours at least four days per week in order to maximize the productivity gains that come from having a collaborative culture and a common workplace; however, we also recognize that such employees can be equally productive working from home some of the time or with a flexible workday that they can structure around significant events outside of the workplace, such as commute times or childcare responsibilities.
 Occupational Health and Safety
 Hazardous materials are inherent in our operations, and it is not possible to eliminate completely the risk of accidental exposure from our operations. We have established procedures to comply with governmental regulations regarding workplace safety, including training employees to enable them to recognize risks and empower them to learn, discover, work safely, and to minimize injuries, illnesses, environmental impact and regulatory risks. In 2021, our total illness and injury incidence rate was 0.3 per 100 employees compared to the 2020 industry average of 1.6, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, and our DART (days away/restricted or job transfer) incident rate was 0.0 per 100 employees compared to the 2020 industry average of 1.2. We will continue our efforts to ensure a high level of workplace safety.
