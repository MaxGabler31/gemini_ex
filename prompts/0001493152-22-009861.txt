Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (Endonovo or the “Company”) is an innovative biotechnology company that has developed a bio-electronic approach to regenerative medicine.
 
The Company develops, manufactures and distributes evolutionary medical devices focused on the rapid healing of wounds and reduction of pain, edema and inflammation on and in the human body. The Company’s non-invasive bioelectric medical devices are designed to target inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and central nervous system disorders (“CNS” disorders).
 
Endonovo’s core mission is to transform the field of medicine by developing safe, wearable, non-invasive bioelectric medical devices that deliver the Company’s Electroceutical® Therapy. Endonovo’s bioelectric Electroceutical® devices harnesses bioelectricity to restore key electrochemical processes that initiate anti-inflammatory processes and growth factors in the body necessary for healing to rapidly occur.
 
Corporate History
 
Our predecessor company, Hanover Asset Management, Inc. was incorporated in November 2008 in California. For the purpose of reincorporating in Delaware, we merged with a newly incorporated successor company, Hanover Portfolio Acquisitions, Inc., in July 2011 under which we continue to operate.
 
IP Resources International, Inc. began operations on September 1, 2011, and was formally incorporated on October 17, 2011.
 
Reverse Acquisition
 
On March 14, 2012, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Agreement”) with IPR and certain of its shareholders. Under the Agreement, each participating IPR shareholder exchanged all of their issued and outstanding IPR common shares totaling 33,234,294, free and clear of all liens, and $155,000 for Company common shares equal to 1.2342 times the number of IPR shares being transferred to the Company for a total of 410 of our shares. The $155,000 was not paid at closing. The Company recorded the $155,000 as acquisition payable. IPR agreed to make payments of up to 25% of the proceeds from any private placement or gross profits earned by IPR until the obligation is satisfied. The percentage of the proceeds to be paid is at the sole discretion of IPR’s Chief Executive Officer and the ex-Chief Executive Officer of the Company based on the liquidity of the Company.
 
As a result of the Agreement, the former shareholders of IPR, immediately post acquisition owned approximately 89% of the Company and its officers and directors constituted the majority of the officers and directors of the Company. Since the shareholders, officers and directors of IPR have control of the Company, the acquisition constitutes a reverse acquisition, so IPR was the accounting acquirer and we were the accounting acquiree. For legal purposes, we are the legal parent and IPR is the legal subsidiary.
 
Acquisition of Aviva Companies Corporation
 
On April 2, 2013, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with (i) The Aviva Companies Corporation (“Aviva”) and (ii) all of the shareholders of Aviva (the “Shareholders”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Aviva in exchange for the issuance of 60 shares of our common stock (60,000 pre-reverse split), par value $0.0001 per share to the Shareholders (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Aviva became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Other than in respect to the transaction, there is no material relationship among Aviva’s stockholders and any of the Company’s affiliates, directors, or officers. We are not currently actively pursuing the development of the Aviva Companies Corporation.

Acquisition of WeHealAnimals, Inc.
 
On November 16, 2013, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with (i) WeHealAnimals, Inc. (“WHA”) and (ii) the sole shareholder of WHA (the “Shareholder”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of WHA in exchange for the issuance of 3 shares of our common stock (3,000 shares pre- reverse split), par value $0.0001 per share and $96,000 to the Shareholder (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, WHA became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all of the equity of WHA including its and its sole shareholder’s intellectual property became the property of the Company. This obligation was fully paid on December 15, 2015 through the issuance of 350 shares of stock (350,000 pre-reverse split) to Shareholder. WHA is a Nevada corporation with intellectual property in the fields of bio-technology, including its biologics and time-varying electromagnetic frequencies with potential applications on people and animals that management believes can be developed to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. WHA’s sole shareholder was formerly Chairman and Chief Scientist of Regenetech, Inc. Regenetech was acquired by a company that wanted its technology, biomolecules grown in microgravity, for use in cosmetics. WHA’s sole shareholder left Regenetech with exclusive rights to this proprietary square wave form technology and stem cell technologies, including the patents and patent applications relating thereto.
 
Other than in respect to the transaction, there is no material relationship between WHA’s sole stockholder and any of the Company’s affiliates, directors, or officers.
 
Acquisition of Rio Grande Assets
 
On December 22, 2017, we acquired intellectual property and other assets (the “RGN Assets”) from Rio Grande Neurosciences, Inc. (RGN). The price was $4,500,000 of which we paid $3,000,000 in cash and delivered a $1,500,000 secured promissory note due November 30, 2018, and security agreement. Before such note was due, the note was assigned to Eagle Equities, LLC (“Eagle”) its due date was extended to November 30, 2019, and it was made convertible into our common stock at a price related to our common stock’s market price at the time of conversion. The maturity date was then extended to December 31, 2021. The RGN Assets relate to RGN’s PEMF portfolio of intellectual property, including 27 issued patents with foreign patent protection covering the therapeutic use of PEMF as well as the treatment of various central nervous system disorders. We intend to initiate and fund future clinical trials to evaluate the further use of PEMF in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, including traumatic brain injury, post-concussion syndrome, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.

These bioelectronics devices are also commonly referred to as “electroceuticals.” These products are part of an emerging field termed “Bioelectronic Medicine,” that seeks to harness electrical signals in nerves and cells to alter the course of diseases and conditions. Whereas our competitors are primarily using implantable electrical nerve stimulators, we are developing devices that are not implantable and use electromagnetic pulses to deliver electrical stimulation to cells and tissues. We are developing these bioelectronic devices for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in tissues and vital organs with a concentration on vascular diseases and ischemia/reperfusion injuries.
 
Possible Additional Line of Business
 
Recently management has entered into a program to expand its operations through a program of acquisition of specialty construction and facilities maintenance companies. The Company has had contact with several potential acquisition targets and entered into a letter of intent with one such company. However, no definitive agreements have been signed and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to make any such acquisition or that it will prove profitable.
Intellectual Property:
 
SofPulse: We have 29 issued patents with foreign patent protection covering the therapeutic use of tPEMF as well as the treatment of various central nervous system disorders. Additionally to date, we have filed seven patent applications in the U.S. through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and four international patent applications in the E.U., China, South Korea and Japan covering our Time-Varying Electromagnetic Field (TVEMF) technology, the production of biomolecules, the creation of an allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell product a treatment for chemical and radiation injuries, production of stem cell secretome and a method of treating tissues and organs using our TVEMF technology. To date, we have been granted one U.S. Patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,410,143) issued on August 9, 2017, covering the production of human biomolecules using our TVEMF technology. We will continue to seek to strengthen our portfolio of intellectual property by filing additional patents around uses of our core technologies.
 
Our business strategy is aimed at building value by positioning each of our technologies and therapies to treat specific diseases that lack effective treatment, post-operative pain and edema, or whose current standard of treatment involves invasive procedures and/or potentially harmful side effects. We anticipate updating and refining the business strategy as new medical and/or clinical advancements are made as a result of extensive research and development.

BioElectric Medicine vs. Drug Therapies
 
Over the past 15 years, long-acting and extended-release opioids have been used to treat open wounds, post-operative wounds and chronic pain. These opioids are normally administered at high doses and over long treatment durations particularly in the United States, resulting in a drastic increase in the number opioid-tolerant individuals and a prescription opioid abuse epidemic. Endonovo offers an alternative, non-opioid treatment through its Electroceuticals® systems: The Company’s SofPulse® system is a medical device/designed to rapidly reduce post-operative swelling/edema, pain and to treat and accelerate the recovery of chronic wounds through the use of tPEMF. Chronic pain therapy via tPEMF works by relieving the underlying cause of pain – inflammation.
 
Drug therapies remain the standard of care for a broad range of medical conditions, including high blood pressure, chronic pain, autoimmune diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Management believes that bioelectronic medicine has developed as a viable alternative for the treatment of many disorders.
 
Normally, our nervous systems send signals to our tissues and organs to suppress inflammation, a phenomenon known as the inflammatory reflex. But sometimes, this system does not work properly, with malfunctions resulting in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Traditionally, doctors have treated these diseases using drugs designed to suppress inflammation, such as infliximab (trade name Remicade) or adalimumab (Humira). But these drugs are expensive. Plus, they don’t work for everyone, often come with nasty side effects, and in some rare cases, they can even kill.
 
Current Product Being Sold – SofPulse®
 

In clinical trials, the SofPulse® device has proven to reduce mean pain scores by nearly 300% and inflammation by 275% thereby improving and reducing recovery time. Additionally, active patients have experienced a 2.2-fold reduction in narcotic use. The SofPulse® delivers tPEMF to enhance post-surgical recovery, naturally. Since the SofPulse® is non-invasive and non-pharmacologic, there are no known side effects and no potential for overdose or dependency AND no effects on healthy tissue.

How the SofPulse® Works
 
SofPulse® delivers low intensity microcurrents of energy directly to the procedure site, to enhance recovery, by increasing the amount of naturally occurring Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), thereby increasing the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels (Angiogenesis). Within hours/days, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) enhances, thereby increasing the production of Collagen/Granulation (within days) and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-β) accelerating Remodeling in the body within days/weeks. This device reduces inflammation and speeds/improves the healing process. The natural healing process allows patients to get back to life faster with lowered use of narcotics. A surgeon places and activates SofPulse® immediately after a procedure. The SofPulse® can be placed over a surgical dressing or clothing and can easily be applied and/or removed in many cases by the patient themselves. The length of time the device is used will vary depending on the type of procedure.
 

The SofPulse® allows patients to get back to an active life faster with less use of narcotics.
