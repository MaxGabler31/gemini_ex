Liquidity
 
The Company’s first medical dispensary opened in West Hollywood, California in 2015. Throughout the years, as the cannabis industry has expanded and matured, the Company has experienced the “highs” and the “lows” that have impacted the industry generally. For various reasons, fiscal year 2022 has been a particularly challenging year both for the cannabis industry and for the Company. Fiscal year 2022 was characterized by significant liquidity and cash flow constraints and uncertainty. Beginning in fiscal third quarter 2019, the Company initiated an operational and financial restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2022, the Company continued this restructuring process, with a particular emphasis on restructuring its balance sheet. As a result of this emphasis, the Company entered legally binding agreements for the sale of its assets in New York and Florida. Purposes of these proposed asset sales included both paying down the Company’s obligations to its senior lender, and funding operations. In addition, as part of that restructuring effort, the Company extended payment terms, negotiated settlements with vendors and service providers, repaid debts through the issuance of shares of Class B Subordinated Voting Shares, and entered into negotiations with its landlords with the objective of achieving either more favorable lease terms or an exit from certain unsustainable lease situations. All of these initiatives were intended to allow the Company to remain solvent and operational. In addition, the Company has evaluated various means of achieving protection from creditors that would be similar to what is available to the non-cannabis industry seeking to reorganize under bankruptcy. At the same time, the Company has continued to execute aggressively in the restructuring of operations including through the closure of its distribution facility in Los Angeles, the closure of its corporate offices in Los Angeles, reductions in headcount and other cost cutting measures. After all of what fiscal year 2022 brought, the Company believes at the start of fiscal year 2023 that the Company has a path forward, albeit a narrow one that requires us to act deliberately and swiftly.
 
As of June 25, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million and a working capital deficit of $164.9 million. The Company has incurred losses from continuing operations of $165.5 million and $124.3 million in fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively, used cash in continued operating activities of $18.9 million and anticipates that the Company will continue to incur losses until such time as revenues exceed operating costs and the Company is able to complete its restructuring plan. As of June 25, 2022, the Company is in violation of minimum liquidity covenant of these term loans. The term loans require the Company to maintain $15.0 million minimum cash. On July 31, 2022, these term loans of $97.8 million became due and the Company was unable to meet this financial obligation and pay the lender, which constitutes an event of default. The moneys owed under the Lender and Landlord Support Agreement which allowed us to defer $22.0 million of rent payment over three years beginning in 2020, will come due in July 2023. On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Florida-based assets for $63.0 million and the assumption of certain liabilities that the Company valued at approximately $4.0 million, a reduction of $16.0 million from the originally announced sales price of $83.0 million. The purchase price was less than first negotiated due to factors that include changes in the market values of cannabis assets in Florida and the Company’s desire to close the transaction in a timely manner with a counterparty likely to achieve state regulatory approval. The buyer made a cash payment of $40.0 million at closing and is required to make two additional installment payments of $11.5 million each after the closing. The net proceeds to the Company at closing were $14.5 million, with a $25.0 million payment going to the Company’s secured senior lender. Proceeds of the transaction to the Company will be used to fund operations and pay interest to its secured senior lender while the term loans remain outstanding and in default. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations for at least one year from the issuance of these Consolidated Financial Statements, and therefore, to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company plans to continue to fund its operations through the implementation of its cost savings plan, and various strategic actions, including the successful negotiations of lower costs of occupancy with its master lease landlord and other landlords, divesture of non-core assets including but not limited to the current asset groups held for sale, New York, as well continuing its on-going revenue strategy of market expansion and retail revenue growth. The Company also needs to obtain an extension or a refinancing of its debt-in-default with the secured senior lender. The annual operating plan for fiscal year 2023 estimates the Company will be able to manage its ongoing operations. However, the Company’s cash needs are significant and not achievable with the current cash flow from operations. If the above strategic actions, for any reason, are inaccessible, it will have a significantly negative effect on the Company’s financial condition. Additionally, the Company expects to continue to manage the Company’s operating expenses and reduce its projected cash requirements through reduction of its expenses by delaying new store development, permanently or temporarily closing stores that are deemed to be performing below expectations, and/or implementing other restructuring activities. Furthermore, COVID-19 and the impact the global pandemic has had and will continue to have on the broader retail environment could also have a significant impact on the Company’s financial operations.
 
As of June 25, 2022, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

General
 
As of June 25, 2022, the Company operated 30 store locations across California (13), Florida (7), New York (4) Nevada (3), Illinois (1), Massachusetts (1) and Arizona (1). The Company’s retail stores are located in strategic locations across key cities and neighborhoods in each of its markets. As of June 25, 2022, all store locations and cultivation/manufacturing facilities in Florida and New York are considered held for sale and reported as discontinued operations. The Company has leases and plans to open additional retail stores over the next 12 months, including, but not limited to the following cities which may or may not continue depending on its ability to finance the build-out of the respective stores and continue to sustain the respective lease expenses while these locations are unbuilt or unoccupied:

● | San Francisco, CA
--+------------------


● | Morton Grove, IL
--+-----------------


● | Newton, MA
--+-----------


● | New York, NY
--+-------------

 
The Company expects to continue strengthening its retail operations and in the foreseeable future critically assess the viability of each of its store’s profitability. If in the event of not being able to achieve store-level profitability, the Company will seek all possible actions to remedy the stores’ operations including disposal by sale or otherwise. The Company will also continue to assess a pipeline of stores through acquisitions, partnerships and applications for new licenses, with a focus on recreational states such as California, Arizona, Illinois and Massachusetts.
 
The Company has had some success in its digital platform and plans to continue assessing growth opportunities. The Company launched statewide, same-day delivery in California in August 2019 and launched delivery in Nevada in September 2019. See “Retail Operations - In-Store Pickup and Delivery” for further information about the Company’s delivery operations.
 
The Company launched MedMen Buds, the Company’s loyalty program in July 2019. The program currently is offered in all of the Company’s stores in Arizona, Nevada and California and has more than 800,000 members. See “Retail Operations - Loyalty Program” for further information about the Company’s loyalty program.

MedMen operated five cultivation and production facilities across Nevada, California, New York, Florida and Arizona. During the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company effectuated four contractual agreements with American Family of Brands, LLC (“AFB”), an unrelated third party and no longer has a controlling financial interest in previously consolidated entities, Manlin DHS Development, LLC (“DHS”) and Project Mustang Development, LLC (“Mustang”), its cultivation facilities in California and Nevada, respectively, therefore these entities are no longer included in the Company’s financial statements. The deconsolidation did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Description of the Business - Cultivation and Production Operations” under “Management Agreement with AFB” for further information about the Company’s cultivation and production operations.
 
In New York and Florida, the cultivation and production facilities have been focused primarily on the commercialization of medical cannabis and, in select locations, the research and development of new strains of cannabis and cultivation techniques. The procedures at each facility place an emphasis on customer and patient safety, with a strict quality control process. See “Description of the Business - Cultivation and Production Operations” for further information about the Company’s cultivation and production operations. 
 
In February 2021, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement with respect to its New York operations whereby a controlling interest would be acquired by an unrelated third party, Ascend Wellness Holdings (“AWH”). On January 3, 2022, the Company announced its termination and of the Investment Agreement. On January 13, 2022, AWH and AWH New York, LLC filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, Commercial Division, against MedMen NY, Inc., MM Enterprises USA, LLC, Project Compassion NY, LLC and Project Compassion Capital, LLC seeking specific performance and a declaratory judgement relating to the Investment Agreement dated February 25, 2021 between the parties. On May 11, 2022, the Company announced a settlement agreement with AWH that would allow the sale of MedMen’s New York operations to close for increased consideration. The agreement resolved the litigation between MedMen and AWH concerning the transaction and added $15.0 million in additional purchase price. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, AWH was to pay MedMen $88.0 million: $73.0 million as an assumption of MedMen’s existing debt and $15.0 million in cash. Other terms of the transaction remained as originally announced in February 2021. It is unclear whether the sale of the New York assets will be completed with AWH. At this moment the Company continues to hold and market the sale of its stores and cultivation facility in New York state to all interested parties. On or about August 15, 2022, the Company learned that AWH had announced publicly that it intended to breach the settlement agreement and to terminate the transaction with MedMen. Management’s plans for the sale of the New York operations have not changed and the Company will continue to market the business to other interested parties.
 
In February 2022, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of substantially all of the Company’s Florida-based assets, including its license, dispensaries, inventory and cultivation operations, and assumption of certain liabilities. In connection with the sale transaction, the Company agreed to license the tradename “MedMen” to Buyer for use in Florida for a period of two years, subject to termination rights. The assets and liabilities allocable to the operations within the state of Florida have been classified as a discontinued operation. On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Florida-based assets for $63.0 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in liabilities, a reduction of approximately $16.0 million from the originally announced sales price of $83.0 million. Prior to the transaction and reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended June 25, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $16.0 million to write-down the carrying basis of the assets held for sale. The reduction of the sales price reflects a decline in market values of cannabis assets in Florida and the Company’s desire to close the transaction in a timely manner with a counterparty likely to achieve state regulatory approval.
 
The Company views Nevada, California, Illinois, Arizona and Massachusetts as providing ongoing opportunities for growth due to their market depth, current favorable supply-demand dynamics and regulatory framework.
 
In addition to owning its own cannabis licenses and operations, the Company also provides management services to third-party cannabis license-holders. The Company currently has management services contracts at two licensed retail dispensaries in California. See “Management Services” for further information about the Company’s management services.
 
The Company is operated by an executive team and has a Board of Directors that has significant experience in the cannabis industry and other analogous industries such as retail, technology, consumer packaged goods, alcohol and apparel.

Market Opportunity
 
Management expects the legalization of cannabis throughout the United States to continue to expand both recreationally and medically. In the United States, 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, have legalized cannabis for recreational purposes or “adult-use”. These states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. In these markets, recreational sales are expected to grow as cannabis retailers, as permitted by law, benefit from a shift in consumers from illegal sales to legal sales and from new cannabis consumers. The Company is well-versed in operating within a recreational market as well as markets that begin as medical-only markets and transition to recreational use. MedMen will continue to seek opportunities for profitable growth.
 
With respect to medical marijuana, as more research centers study the effects of cannabis-based products in treating or addressing therapeutic needs, and assuming that research findings demonstrate that such products are effective in doing so, management believes that the size of the U.S. medical cannabis market will also continue to grow as more states expand their medical marijuana programs and new states legalize medical marijuana. In the United States, 38 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized medical cannabis. Given MedMen’s experience in New York and Florida, the Company believes that MedMen is well-versed in operating within a medical-only market and will continue to seek opportunities to expand. These markets provide the Company a national platform to execute on its medical strategy, allowing the Company to serve both medical and recreational consumers.
 
Retail Operations
 
MedMen’s mission is to provide customer’s a best in class, inclusive and informative environment where the customer can comfortably navigate its extensive selection of cannabis products with the assistance of highly trained employees.
 
MedMen operates its retail operations through a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries in California, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois. MedMen currently operates 13 retail stores in California, one retail store in Arizona, three retail stores in Nevada, and one retail store in Illinois, all of which serve both recreational and medical marijuana patients, one retail store in Massachusetts which serves recreational customers, and four retail stores in New York. Seven retail stores in Florida that served medical marijuana patients during 2022. Of the Company’s 13 retail stores in California, the Company owns and operates 11 retail stores and manages the operations of two through long-term management services agreements.
 
In connection with management’s decision to market and sell the Company’s assets in New York and Florida, four and seven of its retail locations, respectively, are currently classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Expanding upon its omni-channel experience, the Company launched its delivery platform in California in August 2019 and in September 2019, MedMen’s delivery service was launched in Nevada. At this time, the Company expects to expand its delivery service in California and in other states where permissible by the regulatory framework. Delivery service is available seven days a week, 365 days a year. Both MedMen Buds and MedMen Delivery cement the Company’s commitment to continuously evolving the consumer experience. During fiscal year 2021, the Company no longer delivers in Nevada and expect to bring back this service at a later date.
 
In connection with the contractual agreements with AFB as further described above, the Company is contractually obligated to operate no less than 11 retail stores in California, unless 1) if disposed of, the presumed new owner assumes the agreement with AFB, 2) the new owner and AFB enter into a new agreement on terms mutually agreeable, or 3) the Company substitutes the store with a new store of equal caliber.
 
Branding and Marketing
 
MedMen utilizes consistent branding and messaging across its dispensaries under the “MedMen” name. In order to support its retail operations, MedMen has a dedicated marketing team that engages potential customers through in-store demos, social media and promotions, including the MedMen Buds loyalty program, which is described below.
 
MedMen continues to focus on growing market share and allocating capital to maximize shareholder value, which begins with providing a superior retail experience for its consumers. This includes building retail spaces where customers can find cannabis information about the products, while discovering the benefits of cannabis.
 
The Company curates unique cannabis products and resources that reflect the interests of its customers.

MedMen works diligently to identify emerging cannabis trends and influencers within beauty, wellness, fashion, sports, and entertainment lifestyle verticals. As cannabis gains popularity across these categories, MedMen aims to become a leading lifestyle destination for the next-generation cannabis consumer.
 
In order to continue enhancing its customer experience, the Company launched MedMen Buds, a rewards program that encompasses over 800,000 individual participants that continues to grow daily, with members across California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. MedMen understands that in the current retail landscape, building loyalty with core customers is a key driver of continued growth. The Company’s understanding of what its customers value, and how it can meet those needs is critical in deepening its connection with its core customers.
 
Banking and Processing
 
MedMen deposits funds from its dispensary operations into its banking partners in each respective market. The banks are fully aware of the nature of MedMen’s business and continue to remain supportive of MedMen’s growth plans. MedMen’s dispensaries currently accept only cash and debit card and do not process credit card payments. The Company believes that, as regulations continue to evolve, over time most forms of payment will be accepted, however, it is unclear exactly when this may occur.
Product Selection and Offerings
 
Product selection decisions are currently made by MedMen’s team of buyers, which negotiates and receives bids from potential brand vendors across all product categories including flower, vape pens, oils, extracts, edibles and pre-rolls. MedMen bases its product selection decisions on product quality, margin potential, consumer feedback and the ability for the respective brands to scale.
 
MedMen currently sells its own branded products in California, Arizona, Nevada, and New York under MedMen Red and LuxLyte brands. MedMen manufactures its own products in Arizona, New York and Florida, and expects to leverage contract manufacturers in California, Nevada and Illinois for its own branded products.
 
MedMen’s retail locations make available a variety of MedMen and third party (resale) cannabis and cannabis products. Cannabis and cannabis products for sale include but are not limited to: cannabis dry flower, concentrated cannabis oil, vaporizer forms of cannabis, cannabis edible products and other cannabis products.
 
Product Pricing
 
MedMen’s prices vary based on the market conditions and product pricing of vendor partners. Generally, MedMen strives to keep pricing consistent across all store locations within a state. Cannabis product pricing is usually based on operating costs, materials costs, distribution costs, and quality and strength of ingredients.
 
The states of California, Nevada, Florida, Illinois and Massachusetts do not regulate pricing and licensed dispensing organizations within such states may set their own prices for cannabis and cannabis products. The state of New York does regulate pricing of all approved medical marijuana products.
 
Notwithstanding that most of the foregoing states do not regulate pricing of cannabis and cannabis products permitted to be sold in such states, many of them impose taxes on the sale of permitted products, as follows:
 

● | Arizona – Subject to a 16% cannabis excise tax, a local cannabis excise tax which varies by city and/or county of up to 6.3% and sales tax. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | California – Subject to a 15% cannabis excise tax, a local cannabis excise tax which varies by city and/or county, and state sales tax of 7.25% with an additional local sales tax of up to 3%.

Recreational cannabis sales are subject to the following cannabis excise and sales tax structure:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In-Store Pickup and Delivery
 
MedMen offers in-store pickup in most retail locations, accessible from MedMen’s website. Measures to enhance this offering and expand its availability into certain of the Company’s other operating states, where permitted under applicable laws and regulations, are underway.
 
The Company launched statewide delivery in California in August 2019.
 
Loyalty Program
 
MedMen launched its loyalty program, MedMen Buds, in July 2019. In addition to providing exclusive access to sales and discounts, members of MedMen Buds earn points for every purchase that lead to rewards. MedMen Buds is currently live in all of the Company’s stores across California, Nevada, Florida and Arizona and counts over 800,000 members.
Inventory Management
 
MedMen has comprehensive inventory management procedures, which are compliant with applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and other requirements. These procedures ensure strict control over MedMen’s cannabis and cannabis product inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or delivery to a consumer, or disposal as cannabis waste. Such inventory management procedures also include measures to prevent contamination and maintain the safety and quality of the products dispensed at MedMen’s retail locations. MedMen understands its responsibility to the greater community and the environment and is committed to providing consumers with a consistent and high-quality supply of cannabis.
Managed Dispensaries
 
MedMen uses the same proprietary, best-practices policies and procedures in both owned and managed dispensaries in order to ensure systematic operations and consistent customer experience. By design, a customer or employee should notice no distinct differences between owned and managed stores. Additionally, MedMen enters into long-term management services agreements, as further described under “Management Services” below.

Cultivation and Production Operations
 
MedMen’s cultivation and production operations are as follows:
 
Nevada (Mustang)
 
Under the Management Agreement with AFB, MedMen’s is the sole customer and purchaser of cannabis and cannabis extracts from this cultivation and production facility in northern Nevada. Prior to the Management Agreement with AFB, MedMen operated this facility. The combined facility is comprised of a 30,000 square foot cultivation facility and a 15,000 square foot production facility and sits on a total of 4.27 acres of land. The 30,000 square foot high-tech Dutch hybrid greenhouse allows for 22,000 square feet of canopy space. The production facility includes state-of-the-art production and extraction equipment. See below under “Management Agreement with AFB” for additional details.
 
California (Desert Hot Springs)
 
Under the Management Agreement with AFB, MedMen’s is the sole customer and purchaser of cannabis and cannabis extracts from this cultivation and production facility in Desert Hot Springs, California. The combined facility is comprised of a 30,000 square foot cultivation facility and a 15,000 square foot production facility and its design is based on the Mustang facility. See below under “Management Agreement with AFB” for additional details.
 
Arizona (Mesa) 
 
The Company operates a 20,000 square foot cultivation and production facility in Mesa, Arizona.
 
New York (Utica)
 
MedMen operates a 25,641 square foot cultivation and production facility in Utica, New York in order to service medical marijuana patients in the state through its master license, which allows for cultivation, production and retail sales.
Florida (Eustis)
 
Until its sale, MedMen operated a 48,358 square foot cultivation and production facility in Eustis, Florida, which is approximately an hour’s drive north from Orlando.
 
In New York and Florida, the cultivation and production facilities are focused primarily on the commercialization of cannabis (both medical and recreational, as permitted under applicable laws) and, in select locations, the research and development of new strains of cannabis and cultivation techniques. The procedures at each facility place an emphasis on customer and patient safety, with a strict quality control process. As of June 25, 2022, the Company held for sale its retail and cultivation/manufacturing operations in New York and Florida. In February 2021, the Company entered into an investment agreement with respect to its New York operations whereby a controlling interest will be acquired by a third party. Accordingly, the operations within the state of New York have been classified as discontinued operations but the Company will continue to advise on the New York operations. On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell MME Florida, LLC, including license, dispensaries, inventory and cultivation operations, and thus classified all assets and liabilities and profit or loss allocable to its operations in the state of Florida as discontinued operations. 
 
Management Agreement with AFB: MedMen operated five cultivation and production facilities across Nevada, California, New York, Florida and Arizona. During the fiscal second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectuated four contractual agreements with American Family of Brands, LLC (“AFB”), an unrelated third party and no longer has a controlling financial interest in previously consolidated entities, Manlin DHS Development, LLC (“DHS”) and Project Mustang Development, LLC (“Mustang”), its cultivation facilities in California and Nevada, respectively, therefore these entities are no longer included in the Company’s financial statements. The deconsolidation did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Real Estate Strategy 
 
MedMen is focused on entering geographic markets which it believes has significant demand potential for cannabis (assessed through industry research, such as financial analyst reports covering the cannabis industry and consumer and retail information from data providers, and management estimates, such as top-down estimates that evaluate the total addressable market (factoring in potential penetration of cannabis consumption within a specific market) as well as using the Company’s own store performance in similar markets to evaluate potential revenue and profitability), and high barriers to entry, such as limited retail licenses, zoning restrictions and licensing requirements. MedMen’s real estate strategy is focused on prime locations with significant foot traffic and proximity to popular attractions (restaurants, malls, sports arenas, hotels, etc.). MedMen targets retail spaces with a footprint of 2,000 to 5,000 square feet, depending on the market and available real estate. MedMen utilizes both its internal real estate team and a network of real estate brokers to negotiate leases on behalf of the Company. MedMen typically prefers to secure long-term leases for its store locations instead of acquiring real estate. Where leasing of the applicable property is not possible, the Company will generally seek a financing partner to assign the purchase and sale agreement to prior to closing and after the Company has secured the license, and then enter into a leaseback transaction with that purchaser. 
Management Services
 
In addition to owning its own retail licenses, MedMen has signed long-term management services contracts with third-party license owners seeking MedMen’s management services. Management services include the use of the “MedMen” brand, retail operations support, human resources, finance and accounting, marketing, sales, legal and compliance. MedMen currently has two management services agreements in place with license owners in California. The two managed dispensaries are located in Venice Beach (Abbot Kinney) and the Los Angeles Airport area.
 
The management services agreements are typically 30 years in length with 10-year renewals and significant penalties if an operator sells its interest in a managed licensed entity (20% of net sale price of licensee with respect to a change of control transaction). The management services agreements currently in place comprise of the following fees: (i) 1.5% of gross revenue for marketing and soft costs, (ii) $20,000 per month shared services fee, (iii) 25% of monthly EBITDA, (iv) 1.5% of construction budget for construction design services, and (v) 5% of construction budget for construction management services.
 
Employees
 
As of June 25, 2022, MedMen had 702 employees across its operating jurisdictions, of which 428 were full-time employees and 82 of which were employed at the corporate level. The remaining employees are part-time and employed at retail, cultivation, production, quality assurance/quality control and supply chain/distribution.
 
MedMen is committed to:

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation: In furtherance of this commitment, MedMen strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees’, independent contractors’ and vendors’ religious beliefs and observances.

MedMen’s employees are highly-talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards as set by MedMen. It is a requirement that all of MedMen’s employees pass background checks and drug screening. MedMen recruits, hires and promotes individuals that are best qualified for each position, priding itself on using a selection process that recruits people who are trainable, cooperative and share its core values as a company.
 
In addition, the safety of MedMen’s employees is a priority and MedMen is committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. MedMen takes all reasonable steps to ensure staff is appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them.
 
MedMen partners with the United Food and Commercial Workers (the “UFCW”). The UFCW is a national labor union that represents cannabis workers throughout the United States. The eligible staff of all current retail locations of MedMen in California is represented by the UFCW. MedMen entered into a collective bargaining agreement with UFCW Local 770 and its sister locals in Southern California in 2018 (Local Union 135) and has expanded that relationship to include UFCW Local 5 and Local Union 324 in Northern California. In New York, MedMen has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a division of the UFCW (Local Union 338), which represents MedMen’s cultivation and retail staff in New York state. MedMen has also entered into Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations with UFCW, Local Union 881 in Illinois, to include eligible employees in its Oak Park location.
 
Competition
 
The Company continues to face intense competition from other companies as well as from the illicit market, some of which may have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience. With the significant increase in cannabis retail licenses issued by the various States, the Company could face increased competition by larger and better financed competitors.
 
Growers of cannabis and retailers operating in the illicit market continue to hold significant market share in States across the U.S. and are effectively competitors to the business. Illicit market participants divert customers away through product offering, price point, anonymity and convenience.
 
During the fiscal year 2022, several States where the Company operates issued new cannabis retail licenses. California issued 539 new retail licenses, Arizona issued 26, Illinois issued 149 and other states such as Florida and Massachusetts continue to approve new dispensary locations. While not all licenses issued are operational, certain jurisdictions such as California, Massachusetts, and Florida do not have a limit on the number of retail locations. As demand for legal cannabis increases and the number of authorized retail distribution points increases, the Company believes new competitors are likely to enter the U.S. retail cannabis market. Nevertheless, the Company believes its brand recognition combined with the variety of cannabis products offered and its premium retail experience will allow MedMen to maintain market share.
 
With respect to retail operations, MedMen expects to compete with other retail license holders across the states in which it operates. Many of MedMen’s competitors in the markets in which MedMen are small local operators and large multi-state operators. In certain markets such as Los Angeles, there are also several illegally operating dispensaries, which serve as competition. In addition to physical dispensaries, MedMen also competes with third party delivery services, which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services.
 
Intellectual Property
 
MedMen has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. These proprietary technologies and processes include its seed-to-sale software, cultivation and extraction techniques, and cultivation equipment and irrigation systems. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, MedMen relies on non-disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection.
 
MedMen has invested significant resources towards developing a recognizable and unique brand consistent with premium, high-end retailers in analogous industries. To date, MedMen has 13 registered federal trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, two registered trademarks in Canada, two trademark applications in Israel, six registered trademarks in Mexico, one registered trademark in California, 17 registered trademarks in Nevada, five registered trademarks in Florida and three registered trademarks in New York. All U.S. federal registered trademarks are further described below.
 
MedMen’s in-house and outside legal counsel monitor and swiftly respond to potential intellectual property infringement. Additionally, MedMen maintains strict standards and operating procedures regarding its intellectual property, including the regular use of non-disclosure, confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements.
 
In connection with the contractual agreements with AFB as further described above, the Company is legally obligated to have DHS and Mustang as the exclusive manufacturers of MedMen Red products in each of the territories.

UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
Federal Regulatory Environment
 
The federal government of the United States regulates controlled substances through the CSA, which places controlled substances on one of five schedules. Currently, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance means the Drug Enforcement Agency considers it to have a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical treatment, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of it even under medical supervision. The federal government has sought to provide guidance to enforcement agencies and banking institutions with the introduction of the United States Department of Justice Memorandum drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole in 2013 (the “Cole Memo”) and the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) guidance in 2014.
 
The Cole Memo offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memo noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memo’s enforcement priorities. The Department of Justice did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memo. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors.
 
15

 

In January 2018, then United States Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, by way of issuance of a new Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Memorandum (the “Sessions Memo”), rescinded the Cole Memo and thereby created a vacuum of guidance for enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice. The Sessions Memorandum explains the DOJ’s rationale for rescinding all past DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance, claiming that Obama-era enforcement policies are “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, in chapter 9.27.230 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memo, are based on the use of the federal government’s limited resources and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Although the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a federally illegal Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise instruct U.S. Attorneys to consider the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses a DOJ priority, and in practice, most U.S. Attorneys have not changed their prosecutorial approach to date. As a result, federal prosecutors are free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memo as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and as a result it is uncertain how active federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities.
 
On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney General. During his campaign, President Biden stated a policy goal to decriminalize possession of cannabis at the federal level, but he has not publicly supported the full legalization of cannabis. In response to questions posed by Senator Cory Booker, Merrick Garland stated during February 2021 congressional testimony that he would reinstitute a version of the Cole Memo. He reiterated the statement that the Justice Department under his leadership would not pursue cases against Americans “complying with the laws in states that have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana”, in written responses to the Senate Judiciary Committee provided around March 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memo or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a useful use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. It is unclear what impact, if any, the current administration will have on U.S. federal government enforcement policy on cannabis. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the position of the Department of Justice will or will not change.
 
Because the Department of Justice memorandums serve as discretionary agency guidance and do not constitute a force of law, cannabis related businesses have worked to continually renew the Rohrabacher Blumenauer Appropriations Amendment (originally the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment) that has been included in federal annual spending bills since 2014. This amendment restricts the Department of Justice from using federals funds to prevent states with medical cannabis regulations from implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, which was signed by President Trump on February 14, 2019 and funds the departments of the federal government through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. In signing the Act, President Trump issued a signing statement noting that the Act “provides that the DOJ may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories,” and further stating “I will treat this provision consistent with the President’s constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.” While the signing statement can fairly be read to mean that the executive branch intends to enforce the CSA and other federal laws prohibiting the sale and possession of medical marijuana, the president did issue a similar signing statement in 2017 and no major federal enforcement actions followed. On September 27, 2019, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was temporarily renewed through a stopgap spending bill and was similarly renewed again on November 21, 2019. The Fiscal Year 2020 omnibus spending bill was ultimately passed on December 20, 2019, making the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment effective through September 30, 2020. In signing the spending bill, President Trump again released a statement similar to the ones he made May 2017 and February 2019 regarding the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment. On March 15, 2021 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the Fiscal Year 2022 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2022. Notably, Rohrabacher-Farr has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. If the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.
 
Since 2014, Congress has made immense strides in marijuana policy. The bipartisan Congressional Cannabis Caucus launched in 2017 and is headed by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher (CA-48), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Don Young (AK-At Large), and Jared Polis (CO-02). The group is “dedicated to developing policy reforms that bridge the gap between federal laws banning marijuana and the laws in an ever-growing number of states that have legalized it for medical or recreational purposes” Additionally, each year more Representatives and Senators sign on and cosponsor marijuana legalization bills including the CARERS Act, REFER Act and others. While there are different perspectives on the most effective route to end federal marijuana prohibition, Congressman Blumenauer and Senator Wyden introduced the three-bill package, Path to Marijuana Reform which would fix Section 280E of the Code, eliminate civil asset forfeiture and federal criminal penalties for businesses complying with state law, reduce barriers to banking, and would de-schedule, tax and regulate marijuana in 2017. Senator Booker has also introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, which would deschedule marijuana, and in 2018 Congresswoman Barbara Lee introduced the House companion.

Additionally, on June 7, 2018, the STATES Act was introduced in the Senate by Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic representative Jared Polis of Colorado. The bill provides in relevant part that the provisions of the CSA, as applied to marijuana, “shall not apply to any person acting in compliance with state law relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marihuana.” Even though marijuana will remain within Schedule I under the STATES Act, it makes the CSA unenforceable to the extent it is in conflict with state law. In essence, the bill extends the limitations afforded by the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer protection within the federal budget − which prevents the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency from using funds to enforce federal law against state-legal medical cannabis commercial activity − to both medical and recreational cannabis activity in all states where it has been legalized. By allowing continued prohibition to be a choice by the individual states, the STATES Act does not fully legalize cannabis on a national level. In that respect, the bill emphasizes states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment, which provides that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
 
During his confirmation hearing on February 22, 2021, U.S. Attorney General, The Honorable Merrick B. Garland, testified that the limited resources of the Department of Justice will not be expended to pursue those in compliance with state-regulated cannabis programs, although he did not commit to reinstituting the Cole Memorandum and there is no guarantee regarding the ultimate position of the Biden Administration DOJ.11 Separate and apart from these pronouncements, Congress has withheld funding to the DOJ (pursuant to the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment to federal spending bills) to prosecute state-compliant businesses in the medical marijuana space since 2014.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that the current presidential administration will treat the enforcement of marijuana regulations as low-priority enforcement of U.S. federal laws that conflict with state laws. Accordingly, there are a number of significant risks associated with the business of the Company and unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical and/or adult-use cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a significant risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and the business of the Company may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, extracting, or dispensing cannabis or aiding or abetting or otherwise engaging in a conspiracy to commit such acts in violation of federal law in the United States.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking
 
Due to the CSA categorization of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, U.S. federal law makes it illegal for financial institutions that depend on the Federal Reserve’s money transfer system to take any proceeds from marijuana sales as deposits. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses under the United States Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy.
 
While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to account for the trend towards legalizing medical and recreational marijuana by U.S. states, FinCEN has issued guidance advising prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses, so long as that business is legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities are being violated (such as keeping marijuana away from children and out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk.
 
Due to the fear by financial institutions of being implicated in or prosecuted for money laundering, cannabis businesses are often forced into becoming “cash-only” businesses. As banks and other financial institutions in the U.S. are generally unwilling to risk a potential violation of federal law without guaranteed immunity from prosecution, most refuse to provide any kind of services to cannabis businesses. Despite the attempt by FinCEN to legitimize cannabis banking, in practice its guidance has not made banks much more willing to provide services to cannabis businesses. This is because, as described above, the current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each cannabis business they take on as a customer. Recently, some banks that have been servicing cannabis businesses have been closing accounts operated by cannabis businesses and are now refusing to open accounts for new cannabis businesses for the reasons enumerated above.
 
The few credit unions who have agreed to work with cannabis businesses are limiting those accounts to no more than 5% of their total deposits to avoid creating a liquidity risk. Since the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to cannabis businesses at any time and without notice, these credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from cannabis businesses in a single day, while also servicing the need of their other customers.
 
17

 

State Border Regulation
 
Another aspect of federal law is that it provides that cannabis and cannabis products may not be transported across state lines in the United States. As a result, all cannabis consumed in a state must be grown and produced in that same state. This dynamic could make it more difficult for the Company, in the short term, to maintain a balance between supply and demand. If excess cultivation and production capacity is created in any given state and this is not matched by increased demand in that state, then this could exert downward pressure on the retail price for the products the Company sells. If too many retail licenses are offered by state authorities in any given state, then this could result in increased competition and exert downward pressure on the retail price for the products the Company sells. On the other hand, if cultivation and production in a state fails to match demand then, in the short term, there could be insufficient supply of product in a state to meet demand and while the Company may be able to raise its prices there could be inadequate product availability in the short term, causing the Company’s revenue in that state to fall or to not grow to its full potential.
United States Border Entry
 
The United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers administer determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in the Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen’s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission.
 
Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada’s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States.
 
Tax Concerns
 
An additional challenge to cannabis-related businesses is that the provisions of the Code, Section 280E, are being applied by the United States Internal Revenue Service to businesses operating in the medical and adult use cannabis industry. Section 280E of the Code prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be.
 
Overall, the United States federal government has specifically reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use marijuana even if such sale and disbursement is sanctioned by state law. Accordingly, there are a number of significant risks associated with the business of the Company and unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical and/or adult-use cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a significant risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and the business of the Company may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, extracting, or dispensing cannabis or aiding or abetting or otherwise engaging in a conspiracy to commit such acts in violation of federal law in the United States.

** | In connection with the planned sale of the Company’s assets in New York and Florida, the Company engaged in actions with the respective regulatory bodies to execute transfers of its licenses upon consummation of either or both deals. See “Recent Developments – Turnaround and Growth Plan – Focus on Core Markets” below. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*** | The Company has not renewed the noted license. See “Description of the Business - Cultivation and Production Operations” under “Management Agreement with AFB” for further information.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Disclosure that a license has been granted to or applied for by the Company does not imply that all required regulatory steps have been satisfied to operate a cannabis facility under that license, as licensing commonly requires multiple levels of approval at the state and local level, as well as securing compliant real estate, and licenses listed as having been granted are often provisional in nature.
 
The Company’s operations are in compliance with applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Additionally, the Company uses the same proprietary, best-practices policies and procedures in its managed dispensaries as in its owned dispensaries in order to ensure systematic operations and, as such, to the Company’s knowledge, the dispensaries that the Company manages are in compliance with applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements.
 
While the Company’s compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that the Company’s licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede the ongoing or planned operations of the Company and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
Nonetheless, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” herein, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all the risk factors contained herein.
 
Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States
 
The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in respect of the states in which the Company currently operates and as such in which it is currently contemplated that the Company will be operating upon completion of announced transactions.
 
In the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Although each state in which the Company operates (and anticipates operating) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although the Company believes that its business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws of the United States, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on the business.

Arizona
 
Arizona Regulatory Landscape
 
The Arizona Medical Marijuana Program (the “AZDHS Program”) is governed by Title 9; Chapter 17 Department of Health Services Medical Marijuana Program (the “AZDHS Rules”) and A.R.S. § 36-2801 et seq., as amended from time to time (the “Arizona Act”) (the AZDHS Rules and the Arizona Act collectively referred to herein as the “AMMA”). The Arizona Act, which was approved by the Arizona voters in 2010 provides the legal requirements and restrictions in conjunction with the applicable rules, guidelines and requirements, promulgated by the Arizona Department of Health Services (“AZDHS”). The AZDHS Program provides for a limited number of Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificates (each, an “Arizona License”). The program currently allows 131 Arizona Licenses. A variety of product types are allowed in the state including medical marijuana and manufactured and derivative products which contain medical marijuana.
 
On November 3, 2020, Arizona voters enacted Proposition 207 which legalized adult-use cannabis for persons 21 years of age and older. The ADHS accepted applications for marijuana establishment licenses from early applicants, which are nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries or applicants in counties with less than two (2) nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries, from January 19, 2021 through March 9, 2021. Adult use sales began on January 19 2021, immediately after the ADHS approved early adult use applications for existing nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries. As of August 2021, the ADHS has approved total of 143 adult use establishment licenses. The Arizona Department of Health adopted regulations effective June 1, 2021, for the licensing of retailers, cultivators and manufacturers. In April 2022, ADHS held a lottery to select and issue 26 marijuana establishment licenses to applicants who qualify under the Social Equity Ownership Program. After issuing licenses to qualified early applicants and to the applicants who qualify under the Social Equity Ownership Program, the ADHS may not issue more than one marijuana establishment license for every ten (10) registered pharmacies in Arizona.
 
Licenses
 
Arizona state licenses are renewed biennially. There is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner along with the necessary supporting documents, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Arizona, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. A single license holder is provided with the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products, and is not required to participate in all of the allowable activities. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients only. Delivery to recreational customers is not allowed.
Reporting Requirements
 
The AZDHS has not selected a state mandated seed-to-sale system at this time. Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider or to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale using proprietary methods. The state however, tracks patient dispensing limits through a proprietary state system. Although there are no periodic reporting requirements to the state, full seed-to-sale tracking is required by all licensees and is periodically audited by the AZDHS. Additionally, all sales transactions are manually entered into the state dispensing tracking system at the time of transaction.
California
 
California Regulatory Landscape
 
In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
 
24

 

In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the “Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act” (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the “Adult Use of Marijuana Act” (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adult-use 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the state of California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 141 (“AB-141”) into law in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight of the California cannabis market, thus creating the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). With the passage of AB-141, the DCC consolidates three (3) state cannabis programs – BCC, CDFA, and the MCSB – under a single new department now known as the DCC. The law transfers all of the powers, duties, purposes, functions, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of the BCC, CDFA and CDPH to the DCC. Apart from creating the DCC, AB-141 also institutes many technical fixes and substantive changes to MAUCRSA and thus requires additional rulemaking at the DCC level, which will affect all licensees. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration oversees.
 
In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana.
 
Licenses
 
The Company is licensed to operate as a Medical and Adult-Use Retailer, Cultivator, Manufacturer and Distributor under applicable California and local jurisdictional law. The Company’s licenses permit it to possess, cultivate, manufacture, distribute, dispense and sell medical and adult-use cannabis in the state of California pursuant to the terms of the various licenses issued by the DCC under the provision of the MAUCRSA and California Assembly Bill No. 133.
 
On August 27, 2020, MME Pasadena Retail, Inc. (“MME Pasadena”), a subsidiary of the Company, received a notice from the City of Pasadena that a determination was made that there had been a material change in ownership and/or management of MedMen such that the initial application was no longer valid, resulting in MME Pasadena losing the right to proceed through the cannabis permitting process in the City of Pasadena. On October 21, 2020, MME Pasadena filed a Writ of Mandate in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against the City of Pasadena, followed by a First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate on December 8, 2020, seeking, among other things, an order requiring the city to revoke its denial of MME Pasadena’s application.
 
The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Company’s facilities in California. California state and local licenses are generally renewed annually. License renewal applications are submitted per guidelines published by local cannabis regulators, the DCC. While renewals are generally annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, the Company would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 
Regulations
 
In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. The Company has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, distribute, and sell/dispense/deliver adult-use and medical cannabis and cannabis products. The state also allows the Company to make wholesale purchase of cannabis and cannabis products from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of California has selected Franwell Inc.’s METRC solution (“METRC”) as the state’s track-and-trace (“T&T”) system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain (“seed-to-sale”). The METRC system is mandatory for all licensed operators in the state of California. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface (“API”).

Florida
 
Florida Regulatory Landscape
 
In 2014, the Florida legislature passed a low-THC cannabis law that allowed patients with a limited number of qualifying medical conditions to have access to low-THC cannabis and cannabis products. In 2015, five (5) vertically integrated dispensing organizations (“MMTCs”) were awarded licenses. In November of 2016, voters passed Amendment 2 (the “Amendment”), which expanded the array of qualifying medical conditions and gave patients access to full-strength medical cannabis. Late in the legislative session in 2017, the Florida legislature passed Senate Bill 8-A, which implemented the Amendment but restricted the original initiative by requiring vertical integration, limiting licenses at the state level, and prohibiting the sale and smoking of whole-plant cannabis flower (the “Rule”).
 
In March 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill amending the Rule to allow smoking of whole-plant cannabis flower. In August 2020, the Florida Department of Health’s Office of Medical Marijuana Use (“OMMU”) published emergency rules permitting the production, packaging, labeling, and dispensing of edible medical marijuana derivative products by MMTCs. MMTCs manufacturing edible medical marijuana derivative products must also comply with all requirements for food establishments in Chapter 500 of the Florida Statutes and any rules adopted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
 
Litigation related to the 2015 applicants who were not selected for licensure and the Rule have been frequent and ongoing. In July 2019, the First District Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Department of Health v. Florigrown, ruling that two critical parts of the Rule are unconstitutional: (i) the requirement of vertical integration and (ii) the cap on the number of licenses allowed. The Florida Supreme Court heard argument on May 6, 2020, October 7, 2020, and on May 27, 2021, and rendered a 6-1 ruling on the matter holding the constitutional challenge to vertical integration and licensing caps is not likely to succeed on its merits and overturned the lower court’s injunction. The result of this case allows the Florida Department of Health’s Office of Medical Marijuana Use to move forward in creating and opening an MMTC application process guided by current rules and regulations. It is unknown at this time when the OMMU will again accept new applications.
 
All MMTCs currently operating are required to be vertically integrated, meaning each licensee is responsible for the entire cannabis supply chain: cultivation, processing, transporting and dispensing medical marijuana and low-THC cannabis products.
 
Licenses
 
Florida state licenses are renewed biennially. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application and fees per guidelines published by OMMU. While renewals are biennial, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and regulatory requirements are met, the Company would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Florida, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. Florida is a “vertically-integrated” system, which gives a single license holder the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products. In Florida, license holders must participate in all aspects of the value chain in order to dispense cannabis and cannabis products to patients. Delivery to patients is permitted under the license with approval from the OMMU.
Reporting Requirements
 
The OMMU has not selected a state mandated seed-to-sale system at this time. The state however, tracks patient dispensing limits through a proprietary state system. Although there are no periodic reporting requirements to the State, full seed-to-sale tracking is required by all licensees and is periodically audited by the OMMU. Additionally, all sales transactions are manually entered into the state dispensing tracking system at the time of transaction.

Illinois
 
Illinois Regulatory Landscape
 
In 2013, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act (410 ILCS 130), Public Act 98-0122 (the “Illinois Act”), which was signed into law by the Governor on August 1, 2013 and went into effect on January 1, 2014. The Illinois Act allows an individual who is diagnosed with a debilitating condition to register with the state to obtain cannabis for medical use. The program currently allows 60 Dispensing Organizations (each, a “DO”) and 22 cultivation centers statewide. A large variety of medical cannabis products are allowed in the state, including the smoking of cannabis flower. Overall, the program is administered by the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations (the “IDFPR”) is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program for DOs and the Illinois Department of Agriculture is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program for cultivation centers.
 
In June 2019, the Illinois governor signed legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing and regulating marijuana for recreational use, went into effect on June 25, 2019, however recreational sales of marijuana began in the state on January 1, 2020. The adult use program allowed existing medical marijuana license holders to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“EAAUDO”) licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical marijuana dispensaries (known as “co-located” or “same site” dispensaries) on January 1, 2020, and to have the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail site for every medical marijuana dispensary location the DO already had in its portfolio. All EAAUDO license holders were also required to commit to the state’s groundbreaking Social Equity program either through a financial contribution, grant agreement, donation, incubation program, or sponsorship program.
 
IDFPR will also be issuing an additional 75 Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“AUDO”) licenses in 2020. IDFPR is also expected to issue an additional 110 AUDO licenses by December 21, 2021. On September 3, 2021, the IDFPR announced the results from the Qualifying Applicant Lottery (conducted on July 29, 2021), the Social Equity Justice Involved Lottery (conducted on August 5, 2021), and the Tied Applicant Lottery (conducted on August 19, 2021) as the Department’s final administrative decision regarding applications for Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization Licenses (“Conditional Licenses”) under Sections 15-25 through 15-35.10 of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (“Act”). The Department also intends to issue at least 50 additional Conditional Licenses in 2022 under a new application process consistent with Section 15-35.20 of the Act. On July 22, 2022, Governor JB Pritzker and the IDFPR issued 149 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization Licenses to applicants selected in three lotteries held in the summer of 2021. All businesses qualified as Social Equity Applicants under that Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act.
 
Licenses
 
Licensees are required to submit an annual renewal application and fees per guidelines published by the IDFPR and the Department of Agriculture respectively. While renewals are annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 
Under the adult use program, AUDO licenses are eligible for renewal every other year.

Regulations
 
In the state of Illinois, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. License holders are provided the ability to dispense cannabis and cultivation centers are provided with the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, and transport cannabis products. Delivery is not allowed from dispensaries to patients or consumers. Only designated caregivers may deliver medical cannabis to qualified patients.
 
27

 

Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Illinois has selected BioTrackTHC’s solution as the state’s track and trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale, provided that it has the ability integrate with BioTrackTHC via an API. License holders are required to provide IDFPR an annual financial report.
Massachusetts
 
Massachusetts Regulatory Landscape
 
The use of cannabis for medical use was legalized in Massachusetts by a voter approval of the Massachusetts Marijuana Initiative in 2012. The law took effect on January 1, 2013, eliminating criminal and civil penalties for the possession and use of up to a 60-day or ten-ounce supply of marijuana for medical use for patients possessing a state issued registration card.
 
On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts voters approved Question 4 or the Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization Initiative, which allowed for recreational or “adult use” cannabis in the Commonwealth. On September 12, 2017, the Cannabis Control Commission (“CCC”) was established under Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017 to implement and administer laws enabling access to medical and adult-use cannabis.
 
On November 16, 2018, the CCC issued the first notices for retail marijuana establishments to commence adult-use operations in Massachusetts.
 
Under the current program there are no statewide limits on the total number of licenses permitted however, no individual or entity shall be a controlling person over more than three licenses in a particular class of license. Similarly, no individual, corporation or other entity shall be in a position to control the decision making of more than three licenses in a particular class of license. In addition, all Marijuana Establishments are required to enter into host community agreements with the municipality in which they are located.
 
Licenses
 
Marijuana Establishment licenses are renewed annually. There is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, the applicable licensee provides an accounting of the financial benefits accruing to the municipality as the result of the host community agreement, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Massachusetts, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. A Marijuana Retailer may purchase and transport marijuana products from Marijuana Establishments and transport, sell or otherwise transfer marijuana products to Marijuana Establishments. Delivery is permissible to medical patients only by medical marijuana license holders. A special license type was created in the under the recreational program that allows delivery to recreational customers. Licensed cultivators and product manufacturers may cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, package and sell marijuana products to Marijuana Establishments.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Massachusetts has selected METRC solution as the state’s T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale provided. The system allows for other third-party system integration via API.

Nevada
 
Nevada Regulatory Landscape
 
Medical marijuana use was legalized in Nevada by a ballot initiative in 2000. In November 2016, voters in Nevada passed an adult-use marijuana measure to allow for the sale of recreational marijuana in the state. The first dispensaries to sell adult-use marijuana began sales in July 2017. The Nevada Department of Taxation is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical and adult use cannabis programs. Similar to California, cities and counties in Nevada are allowed to determine the number of local marijuana licenses they will issue.
 
On June 12, 2019, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak signed a new set of laws overhauling Nevada’s medical and recreational cannabis laws. These new laws created a new entity, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”), to take over the functions of bodies like the Nevada Department of Taxation’s Marijuana Enforcement Division. The CCB is modeled off the Nevada Gaming Control Board and began exercising its full powers on July 1, 2020. The CCB quickly gained a reputation for strict enforcement of license requirements, such as the timely payment of taxes and deadlines for the submission of renewal paperwork. Non-compliant licensees now face the shutoff of their access to METRC.
 
Moreover, the CCB requires that in addition to obtaining a Nevada license, each marijuana establishment must obtain a license and land use approval form from the local jurisdiction in which it is situated. A provisional or conditional licensee may not engage in cannabis business operations until it has received all necessary local approvals and a final registration certificate from the CCB.
 
The Company only operates in Nevada cities or counties with clearly defined marijuana programs. Currently, the Company is located in the City of Las Vegas, Clark County and Washoe County jurisdictions.
 
Licenses
 
Licenses are renewed annually and there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner along with the necessary supporting documents, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Nevada, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. In Nevada, the Company has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, and sell/dispense/deliver adult-use and medical cannabis and cannabis products. The state also allows the Company to make wholesale purchase of cannabis and cannabis products from another licensed entity within the state.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Nevada uses METRC as the state’s computerized T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to provide data to the state to meet certain reporting requirements. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface.
New York
 
New York Regulatory Landscape
 
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (A06357E, S07923) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The program currently allows 10 Registered Organizations (each, an “RO”) to hold “vertically-integrated” licenses, which gives a license holder the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products. Limited product types are allowed in the state. The New York State Department of Health (the “NYSDOH”) is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program.

On March 31, 2021, former Governor Cuomo signed legislation (S.854-A/A.1248-A) legalizing adult-use cannabis. The bill establishes the Office of Cannabis Management (the “OCM”) to implement and enforce a comprehensive regulatory framework that covers medical, adult-use and cannabinoid hemp. The OCM will be an independent office operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority and will be governed by a five-member board, with three members appointed by the Governor and one appointment by each legislative house.
 
Concerning medical cannabis, the legislation will allow people with a larger list of medical conditions to access medical marijuana, increase the number of caregivers allowed per patient, and permit home cultivation of medical cannabis for patients.
 
Concerning adult-use cannabis, the legislation will create a two-tier licensing structure that will allow for a range of producers by separating those growers and processors from also owning retail stores. The legislation creates licenses for producers and distributors, among other entities, and the legislation will implement strict quality control, public health and consumer protections. The legislation also implements a new cannabis tax structure that will replace a weight-based tax with a tax per mg of THC at the distributor level with different rates depending on final product type. The wholesale excise tax will be moved to the retail level with a 9% state excise tax. The local excise tax rate will be 4% of the retail price. Counties will receive 25% of the local retail tax revenue, and 75% will go to the municipality. Cities, towns, and villages may opt-out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by December 31, 2021, or nine (9) months after the effective date of the legislation. They cannot opt-out of adult-use legalization.
 
On February 22, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law S.8084-A/A.9283-A, creating a new Adult-Use Conditional Cultivator License, authorizing eligible hemp growers to apply for a license to grow cannabis containing over 0.3% THC for the adult-use cannabis market. To be eligible for licensure, the hemp grower must have been authorized to grow hemp under the Department of Agriculture and Markets Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program and meet certain other requirements. The Conditional Cultivator program puts New York farmers first, jumpstarting the New York Cannabis Industry and the Cannabis Law’s focus on social and economic equity. On March 10, 2022, the Cannabis Control Board (Board) approved the application and opening of the application window for Conditional Cultivators beginning March 15, 2022 and remaining open until June 30, 2022.
 
The same law created an adult-use conditional processor license. This license will allow businesses who are already licensed to process cannabinoid hemp in the Cannabinoid Hemp Program to apply for a license to process adult-use cannabis products in the Adult-Use Program. This application opportunity is only available to active cannabinoid hemp processor license-holders who applied for their license before January 1, 2022. Pursuant to the Cannabis Law, adult-use conditional processor licensees will be permitted to process cannabis products containing over 0.3% THC for the Adult-Use Cannabis Program. The license will also be authorized for the distribution of cannabis products to duly licensed adult-use retail dispensaries until June 1, 2023. After June 1, 2023, conditional processors seeking to distribute cannabis products, will be required to apply for a separate distributor license to engage in this activity. On June 23, 2022, the Cannabis Control Board (Board) approved the application and opening of the application window for Conditional Processors beginning June 28, 2022 and remaining open until August 31, 2022.
 
Licenses
 
State licenses in New York for Registered Organizations are renewed biennially. Before the two-year period ends, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the NYSDOH. While renewals are granted every two years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of New York, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. In New York, ROs are permitted to wholesale manufactured product and extracted cannabis. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients with prior approval.

Reporting Requirements
 
The state of New York has selected BioTrackTHC’s solution as the state’s T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system is required to serve as all ROs’ patient verification system, but is optional as the RO facing tracking system. In addition to entering all dispensing transactions into the BioTrackTHC system, every month the NYSDOH requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing all products dispensed for the month.
Regulatory Affairs Program
 
The Company’s Senior Vice President of Capital Markets & Legal Affairs oversees, maintains, and implements the compliance program and personnel. In addition to the Company’s legal and regulatory affairs departments, the Company also has local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in the jurisdictions (state and local) in which it operates. Such counsel provides legal advice to the Company regarding compliance with state and local laws and regulations and the Company’s legal and compliance exposures under United States federal law. The Senior Vice President of Capital Markets & Legal Affairs serve as liaisons to state and local regulators during both regular business hours and after hours. The Compliance Department, in partnership with the Retail, Human Resources, Legal, and Logistics Departments, is responsible for ensuring operations and employees strictly comply with applicable laws, regulations and licensing conditions and ensure that operations do not endanger the health, safety or welfare of the community. The Senior Vice President of Capital Markets & Legal Affairs coordinates with the Security Department to ensure that the operation and all employees are following and complying with the Company’s written security procedures.
 
The Compliance Department oversees training for all employees, including on the following topics:
 

● | Compliance with State and Local Laws
--+-------------------------------------


● | Safe Cannabis Use
--+------------------


● | Dispensing Procedures
--+----------------------


● | Security & Safety Policies and Procedures
--+------------------------------------------


● | Inventory Control
--+------------------


● | Track-and-Trace Training Session

--+--------------------------

 
The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed-to-sale system.
 
The Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures, operating plans, trackers and checklists that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements.
 
SERVICE PROVIDERS
 
As a result of any adverse change to the approach in enforcement of United States cannabis laws, adverse regulatory or political change, additional scrutiny by regulatory authorities, adverse change in public perception in respect of the consumption of marijuana or otherwise, third party service providers to the Company could suspend or withdraw their services, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects.

ABILITY TO ACCESS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL
 
In the second half of fiscal year 2022, the Company attempted to complete a bridge loan for $20.0 million with an unrelated third-party lender to address liquidity needs until such a time the Company completed the sale of assets in New York and Florida. The Company was unsuccessful and the lender ultimately did not complete the lending, at least in part due to the uncertainty of the date by which the sale of the Florida assets was anticipated to close. While the Company has previously accessed capital markets successfully, the Company believes the facts and circumstances at a macroeconomic cannabis industry level are riskier to investors, coupled with its history of losses, high management turnover and complex debt and equity structures On July 31, 2022, the senior term notes payable became due and payable. The Company depend on the ability to close the sales of its assets in New York and on the sale of its assets in Florida in order to repay the $97.7 million outstanding. Neither of these assets sales had closed by July 31, 2022. While the sale of the Company’s Florida assets closed on August 22, 2022 and the Company entered into agreements to use a total of $40.0 million of the proceeds from that transaction to pay down the balance of the amount outstanding, the Company remains in default regarding the repayment of the balance of that debt. The Company’s inability to raise financing to fund operating or capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its ability to operate or its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or prospects.
 
COVID-19
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. While the ultimate severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment is uncertain, the Company is monitoring this closely. As of June 25, 2022, the Company currently operates 30 store locations across California (13), Florida (7), New York (4), Nevada (3), Illinois (1), Massachusetts (1) and Arizona (1). The Company’s priority during the COVID-19 pandemic has been protecting the safety of its employees and customers and it is following the recommended guidelines of applicable government and health authorities. Despite being deemed as an essential retailer in its core markets, the Company has experienced a negative impact on sales in certain markets as a result of shelter-at-home orders, social distancing efforts, restrictions on the maximum allowable number of people within a retail establishment and declining tourism. Although the Company only permanently closed one store as a result of COVID-19, certain markets, such as California and Nevada, experienced a greater impact on sales due to reduced store hours and foot traffic in certain locations, as well as limits on the number of customers that may be in a store at any one time. Other markets, such as Illinois and Florida were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 and in some cases, stores in those markets have generated increased sales. Due to its strong vendor partnerships in each market, the Company has not experienced a significant impact to its supply chain in each market. In the event that the Company were to experience widespread transmission of the virus at one or more of the Company’s stores or other facilities, the Company could suffer reputational harm or other potential liability. Further, the Company’s business operations may be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of the Company’s employees are impacted by the virus.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of COVID-19, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. The Company did not utilize any relief provided by the CARES Act and, as a cannabis retailer, the Company is not eligible to obtain a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The Paycheck Protection Program is governed by the rules of the Small Business Administration, which considers as ineligible for loans business concerns that are engaged in any illegal activity; the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis violates federal law in the United States. Accordingly, the CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended June 26, 2021. To date, the Company has generally implemented certain safety measures to ensure the safety of its customers and associates, which may have the effect of discouraging shopping or limiting the occupancy of its stores. Store operations in California and Nevada have been modified, with an increased focus on direct-to-consumer delivery and enabling a curbside pickup option for its customers. The Company leveraged its technology team to build the enhanced omni-channel functionality in, and expects to continue offering, a variety of purchasing options for its customers. These measures, and any additional measures that have been and may continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantially decreased and may continue to decrease, the number of customers that visit the stores which has had, and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the extent of its overall impact on the financial and operational results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time; however, the Company has experienced significant declines in sales. The overall impact will depend on the length of time that the pandemic and the various strains of viral infections continues, the extent to which it affects the Company’s ability to raise capital, and the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic, as well as uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing. At this time, it is unclear how long these measures may remain in place, what additional measures may be imposed, or when and if the Company’s operations will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In addition, the Company’s business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as such, its results are particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence. COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic conditions, resulting in, among other things, unprecedented increases in the number of people seeking jobless benefits and a significant decline in global financial markets. As a result, as the Company noted in fiscal year 2022, even when all its store locations are fully operational, there can be no guarantee that its revenue will return to its pre-COVID-19 levels.

TURNAROUND AND GROWTH PLAN
 
The Company executed on a number of initiatives to continue restructuring the business and reduce its operating expenses and cash burn:
 
Focus on Core Markets 
 
Beginning in 2019, the Company began searching for opportunities to sell non-core assets to raise non-dilutive financing. The Company determined that the sale of non-core assets would allow for management to further focus on deepening its market share in its core markets. The Company previously intended to sell its assets in Arizona; however, following the passage and expeditious roll-out of adult-use sales in Arizona, the Company reclassified its Arizona operations from discontinued to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Evanston, Illinois
 
On July 1, 2020, the Company executed definitive agreements, which were amended and restated on October 30, 2020, to sell all outstanding membership interests in MME Evanston Retail, LLC, which owns the retail store located in Evanston, Illinois, for total consideration of $20.0 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company received $10.0 million of the total consideration. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company received $8.0 million of the total consideration, which, pursuant to the lender and landlord support agreements entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, was used to paydown amounts outstanding under the Convertible Facility. The final payment of $2.0 million to be received in the form of a secured promissory note payable three months following the closing of the transaction. On August 10, 2020, all operational control and risk of loss was transferred, and the Company had no further obligation to fund operations of Evanston through a Consulting Agreement. In April 2022, the regulatory approval was finalized and the transfer of the cannabis license successfully completed.
New York  Investment Agreement
 
On February 25, 2021, MedMen NY, Inc. (“MMNY”), the New York subsidiary of the Company, and its parent, MM Enterprises USA, entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“AWH NY”), and Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“AWH”, and collectively, the “Investors”) whereby, subject to approval from the New York State Department of Health and other applicable regulatory bodies, AWH agreed to purchase shares of common stock of MMNY for an aggregate purchase price of up to $73.0 million. The Investment Agreement provided that all final regulatory approvals including from the State of New York shall be received by December 31, 2021 (the “Deadline”). All final regulatory approvals were not received by the Deadline and, on January 3, 2022, the Company advised the Investors that of this failure. On January 14, 2022, the Investors filed a complaint in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County against MMNY and MM Enterprises USA in which AWH sought, among other things, to compel the MMNY and the Company to close the transaction on the terms set forth in the Investment Agreement. On May 11, 2022, AWH and the Company entered into a non-binding term sheet settling the legal dispute (the “Term Sheet”). Under the Term Sheet, AWH agreed to increase the transaction consideration set forth in the Investment Agreement by $15.0 million, to $88.0 million, $4.0 million of which was to be contingent on the start of adult-use sales at a MMNY dispensary. The Term Sheet required the parties to use their best efforts to execute a formal settlement agreement based on the terms of the Term Sheet within ten calendar days of their execution of the Term Sheet. The Term Sheet further required the parties to, within thirty days of executing the settlement agreement, complete the closing of the transaction on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Investment Agreement except to the extent modified by the settlement agreement. AWH failed to comply with these provisions of the Term Sheet and, instead, announced during an AWH earnings call on August 15, 2022 that AWH did not intend to close the transaction as required by the Term Sheet.

Florida  Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On August 22, 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MME Florida LLC and MM Enterprises USA closed the sale to Florida-based private company, Green Sentry Holdings, LLC (“Green Sentry”), of substantially all of the Company’s Florida-based assets, including its license, dispensaries, inventory and cultivation operations, and assumption of certain liabilities. The consideration received by the Company was comprised of $63.0 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in liabilities by Green Sentry. The Company consummated the transaction pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated February 27, 2022, as amended by the First Amendment, dated July 31, 2022, and the Second Amendment, dated August 22, 2022, which Second Amendment amended the purchase price and provided that $40.0 million of the purchase price be applied to the repayment of the Company’s Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in several instalments. The amendments to the Asset Purchase Agreement also provide for a deferred rent escrow of approximately $550,000 from the purchase price. The deal includes the license of the Company’s trademarks in the state to Green Sentry, subject to termination rights.

Hilco Process for Rent Reductions Process - 2022
 
In April 2022, management engaged the restructuring firm of Hilco Real Estate to solicit a permanent reduction of rent costs with all landlords. The Company has deferred $360,000 to be due in 2023. In addition, the Company has negotiated rent reductions of approximately $650,000 annually on average and $3,340,000 through the term of the lease. Management continues in negotiations with the remaining landlords and will continue to pursue permanent reductions in lease costs.
Lender and Landlord Support Agreement - 2020
 
On July 3, 2020, the Company announced the execution of definitive agreements (collectively referred to as the “Lender and Landlord Support Agreement”) with certain lenders, including Gotham Green Partners, Stable Road Capital and affiliates, and the landlord for several of its retail, cultivation and manufacturing facilities, Treehouse Real Estate Investment Trust. Lender and Landlord Support Agreement resulted in approximately $32 million of cash commitments over the next twelve months through a combination of cash interest and rent deferrals. The rent deferral of $24.0 million is due on July 1, 2023. The Company is currently in negotiations with the landlord in regard to this deferral payment.
Senior Secured Convertible Note Facility
 
Initial Agreement
 
In April 2019, the Company entered into a senior secured convertible credit facility (the “Convertible Facility”) to provide up to $250.0 million in gross proceeds, arranged by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP”). The Convertible Facility is accessed through issuances by the Company to the lenders of convertible senior secured notes with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 6.0% per annum (“Facility Notes”). In connection with the Convertible Facility, the Company has also issued share purchase warrants (the “Facility Warrants”) to purchase Subordinate Voting Shares. Since April 2019, the Convertible Facility was amended at various times modifying certain covenants, amending the conversion and exercise prices of securities issued pursuant to the Convertible Facility, cancelling and issuing new Facility Warrants and providing additional financing with the issuance of Facility Notes.
Second Restatement
 
On July 2, 2020, the Company amended and restated the Convertible Facility (the “Second Restatement”) wherein the minimum liquidity covenant was waived until September 30, 2020 and resetting at $5,000,000 thereafter with incremental increases on March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2021. The payment-in-kind feature on the Convertible Facility was also extended, such that 100% of the cash interest due prior to June 2021 will be paid-in-kind and 50% of the cash interest due thereafter will be paid-in-kind. The Second Restatement released certain assets from its collateral to allow greater flexibility to generate proceeds through the sale of non-core assets. The Second Restatement allowed for immediate prepayment of amounts under the Convertible Facility with a 5% prepayment penalty until 2nd anniversary of the Second Restatement and 3% prepayment penalty thereafter. As part of the Second Restatement, holders of Facility Notes were provided down-round protection where issuances of equity interests (including securities that are convertible or exchangeable for equity interests) by the Company at less than the higher of (i) lowest conversion price under the amended and restated notes of the Convertible Facility amendment dated March 27, 2020 and (ii) the highest conversion price determined for any incremental advances, will automatically adjust the conversion/exercise price of the previous tranches and incremental tranche 4 warrants and the related replacement warrants to the price of the newly issued equity interests. Certain issuances of equity interests were exempted such as issuances to existing lenders, equity interests in contemplation at the time of Second Restatement and equity interests issued to employees, consultants, directors, advisors or other third parties, in exchange for goods and services or compensation. As consideration for the amendment, the conversion price for 52% of the tranches 1 through 3 and the first amendment fee notes outstanding under the Convertible Facility were amended to $0.34 per share. An amendment fee of $2,000,000 was also paid through the issuance of additional notes at a conversion price of $0.28 per share.
 
35

 

On September 14, 2020, the Company was advanced an additional $5,000,000 in gross proceeds (the “Incremental Advance”) under the Convertible Facility and the Company issued additional Facility Notes with a conversion price per share of $0.20. In connection with the Incremental Advance, the Company issued 25,000,000 Facility Warrants with an exercise price of $0.20 per share. In addition, 1,080,255 existing Facility Warrants were cancelled and replaced with 16,875,001 Facility Warrants with an exercise price of $0.20 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Facility, the conversion price for 5.0% of the existing Facility Notes outstanding prior to Tranche 4 and Incremental Advance (including paid-in-kind interest accrued on such Notes), being 5.0% of an aggregate principal amount of $170,729,923, was amended to $0.20 per share. As consideration for the additional advance, the Company also issued convertible notes as consideration for a $468,564 fee with a conversion price of $0.20 per share.
 
The Convertible Facility was also amended to include, among other things, a modification to the minimum liquidity covenant, which extends the period during which it is waived from September 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The minimum liquidity threshold resets to $5.0 million thereafter to $7.5 million effective on March 31, 2021 and then to $15.0 million effective on December 31, 2021.
 
On September 16, 2020 and September 28, 2020, the down round feature on the Facility Notes and Facility Warrants issued in connection with Tranche 4, Incremental Advances and certain amendment fees was triggered wherein the exercise price was adjusted to $0.17 and $0.15 per share, respectively.
 
Third Restatement
 
On January 11, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Convertible Facility (the “Third Restatement”) pursuant to which the Company received an additional advance of $10.0 million evidenced by the issuance of Facility Notes with a conversion price of $0.1608 per Subordinate Voting Share. In connection with the Third Restatement, the Company paid a fee of $937,127, which amount is also evidenced by the issuance of Facility Notes with a conversion price of $0.1608 per Share. The Company also issued 62,174,567 Facility Warrants exercisable for five years at a purchase price of $0.1608 per Share. The Facility Notes, and Facility Warrants issued pursuant to the Third Restatement included down round adjustment provisions, with certain exceptions, if the Company issued securities at a lower price.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Third Restatement, of the $168.1 million Facility Notes outstanding prior to Tranche 4 and the Incremental Advances thereunder (including paid-in-kind interest accrued on such notes), the conversion price of $47.1 million of the Facility Notes was changed to $0.17 per share ($16.8 million of which continued to be subject to down round adjustment provisions), and the Company cancelled an aggregate of 2,160,507 Facility Warrants that were issued with such notes and, in exchange, issued 41,967,832 Facility Warrants with an exercise price of $0.1608 per share.
 
At the time of the Third Restatement, the Convertible Facility included certain negative covenants, including restrictions on incurring liens and debt, sale of assets, conducting mergers, investments and affiliate transactions and making certain payments. The Convertible Facility was also amended to, among other things, modify the minimum liquidity covenant, which extended the period during which it was waived from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021, reset the minimum liquidity threshold to $7.5 million effective on July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and $15.0 million thereafter, and waived of the minimum liquidity covenant if the Company is current on cash interest. Furthermore, covenants with regards to non-operating leases, capital expenditures and corporate SG&A were tied to a board of directors approved budget.
 
As a result of issuances of convertible debentures pursuant to the Company’s unsecured convertible debenture facility entered into on September 16, 2020, under the terms of the Convertible Facility (prior to the Third Restatement), the conversion prices of a total of approximately $63.9 million Facility Notes and the exercise prices of 130,804,447 Facility Warrants were reduced to $0.1529 per share.
 
On May 11, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement letter (the “Letter”) with GGP wherein the Company received reprieve from certain potential non-compliance with certain covenants under the Third Restatement dated January 11, 2021, such as potential non-compliance with certain reporting and notice requirements, pay certain liabilities when due, deliver control agreements for certain bank accounts, obtain consent from the lenders prior to hiring certain executives, obtain consent from the lenders for certain matters and related items. No amounts were paid by the Company for the Letter.
 
36

 

Fourth Restatement
 
On August 17, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Convertible Facility (“Fourth Restatement”) pursuant to which certain terms were amended, including among other things, extension of the maturity date of the Facility Notes to August 17, 2028, elimination of any cash interest payable and instead providing for paid-in-kind interest, elimination of certain repricing provisions that apply to the Facility Notes and the Facility Warrants, elimination of and revision to certain restrictive covenants and amendment to the minimum liquidity covenant. Accrued paid-in-kind interest will be convertible at the higher of (i) the per Share volume-weighted average price of the Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (or, if not listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, such other recognized stock exchange or quotation system on which the Shares are listed for trading) for the period from the scheduled open of trading until the scheduled close of trading of the primary trading session over the 30 consecutive trading days prior to and including the relevant interest payment date, determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours, and (ii) the price per share determined using the lowest discounted price available pursuant to the pricing policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange or otherwise permitted by the Canadian Securities Exchange. Following the Fourth Restatement, (i) the Facility Notes held by the holders on the effective date of the Fourth Restatement may not be prepaid without the prior written consent of the collateral agent until legalization of the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana at the federal level in the United States, or the removal of the regulation of such activities from the U.S. federal laws, following which any such prepayment shall require no less than six months’ notice from MedMen to the holders of such Facility Notes. The Convertible Facility continues to include affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the following: incurring liens and debt, selling assets, conducting mergers, investments and affiliate transactions and making certain equity distributions, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. No changes were made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Facility Notes or Facility Warrants.
 
The Fourth Restatement also provides the holders of the Facility Notes with a top-up right upon the issuance by MedMen of certain Subordinate Voting Shares, or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for Subordinate Voting Shares, in the form of warrants to acquire additional Subordinate Voting Shares, intended generally to maintain their “as converted” equity interest, and a pre-emptive right with respect to certain future equity financings of the Company, subject to certain exceptions.

In October 2018, MedMen Corp. completed a $77.7 million senior secured term loan (the “2018 Term Loan”) with funds managed by Hankey Capital, LLC and with an affiliate of Stable Road Capital (the “Term Loan Lenders”). The ownership interests of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan.

The Company may prepay without penalty, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan (on a non-revolving basis) upon 15 days’ notice. Certain ownership interests of the Company’s subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan.

The PIK feature will expire if Section 280E tax reform occurs and the Company begins to be taxed similar to other U.S. corporations.
 
The threshold for the minimum liquidity covenant, which was previously $15.0 million, was waived until September 30, 2020, resetting to $5.0 million thereafter, to $7.5 million effective on March 31, 2021 and then to $15.0 million effective on December 31, 2021.

The parties also amended and restated the forms of warrants to conform to previously agreed upon terms, such as down round provisions. The Company agreed to pay an amendment fee of $1.0 million, that is payable upon the earliest of receipt of proceeds from the Level Up disposition or the MedMen NY disposition or when the indebtedness has become due.

The Sixth Modification makes no modification to the current interest rate. The Sixth Modification provides that the definitive documentation with respect to the conditional purchase of the Term Loans by Superhero Acquisition, L.P., an existing lender under the Company’s Senior Secured Convertible Purchase Agreement dated August 7, 2021, must be entered within 45 days or the stated maturity date of the Term Loans become due. The Sixth Modification requires that the Company make a mandatory prepayment of at least $37,500,000 in the event the sale of certain assets and imposes covenants in regards strategic actions the Company must implement if it is unable to pay the Term Loans by the extended stated maturity date. The Company also agreed to prepay $20,000,000 on the Term Loans and pay a fee of $1,000,000 to the Term Loan lenders in consideration of the Sixth Modification, which fee will be paid in Class B Subordinate Voting Shares (“Shares”) with a deemed price of $0.1247 (C$0.1582) for a total of 8,021,593 Class B Subordinate Voting Shares (the “Fee Shares”), with any difference in realized net proceeds that is less than $1,000 from the sale of the Fee Shares during a 30-day period, to the extent such Fee Shares are sold, reimbursed in cash.
