 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 GENERAL
Where Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries (WFCF, the Company, our, we, or us) is a leading trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices in North America. The Company supports more than 15,000 farmers, ranchers, vineyards, wineries, processors, retailers, distributors, trade associations and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including IMI Global, International Certification Services, Validus Verification Services, Sterling Solutions, SureHarvest Services and our newest acquisition, A Bee Organic. In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten-free, non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as WFCF. The Company’s principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, crops and other food products are accurate. In addition, we develop software and provide services related to sustainability measurement and benchmarking, traceability, verification and certification to the food and agriculture industries. The Company’s Where Food Comes From Source Verified® retail and restaurant labeling program utilizes the verification of product attributes to connect consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase through product labeling and web-based information sharing and education. With the use of Quick Response Code (QR) technology, consumers can instantly access information about the producers behind their food.
 WFCF was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation in 2005. The Company’s shares of common stock trade on the OTCQB marketplace under the stock ticker symbol, WFCF.
 The Company’s original name – Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global, Inc.) – was changed to Where Food Comes From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company’s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services for beef producers that wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of mad cow disease in the U.S. Over the years, WFCF has expanded its portfolio to include verification and software services for most food groups and 30 standards. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies.
  BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 What We Do
The Company is one of the nation’s largest independent, third-party providers of food production audits and uses rigorous verification processes to ensure that claims made by food producers and processors are accurate.
 The Where Food Comes From® labeling program offers food retailers and restaurants a means of connecting consumers to information on where and how the food they purchase has been grown or raised.
 With the acquisition of SureHarvest on December 28, 2016, the Company employs a software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
 The Company’s business benefits from growing demand by consumers, retailers and government for increased transparency into food production practices.
   3

 
 Consumers: Due to concerns about food safety, animal welfare and an overall increase in health consciousness, consumers are demanding more information about the food they purchase. 
  Retailers: Responding to consumer demands for increased transparency as well as to the negative impact food scandals have on their bottom lines, retailers are requiring their suppliers to adhere to more stringent traceability and verification of product claims. 
  Government Regulation: The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Disease Traceability program, being phased in over the next few years, gluten-free testing requirements, and ingredient labeling regulations are all impacting product verification. 
  Growth Strategy
Due to organic growth in our portfolio of auditing standards, consumer demand and acquisitions, our sales have grown rapidly from $1.1 million in 2006 to $15.4 million in 2017, an 11-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 27%.

Our growth strategy is as follows:
----------------------------------
 | ● | To cover more food groups than does any other verification provider. Currently we verify beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, produce, grain and finished products. In the future, we hope to include seafood, beverages and other produce. 


● | To offer solutions for ALL participants in the food supply chain, including feed and input ingredient providers, farmers, producers, packers, auction barns, processors, handlers, distributors, restaurants, retailers and consumers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To expand on the industry’s largest solutions portfolio. We currently are verifying or certifying to more than 30 certification standards or guidelines. To our knowledge, that is the most in the industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue organic growth. We leverage our bundling capability to aggressively pursue new customers, while sustaining our recurring revenue model and high retention rates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue growth through merger and acquisition opportunities. Through selective acquisitions, we can expand our footprint, add new services, food groups and revenue streams.

 SureHarvest develops software and provides services related to sustainability measurement and benchmarking, traceability, verification and certification to the food and agriculture industries. Its patented sustainability software solutions support more than 2,200 agri-food operations, including growers, packers, shippers, processors, wineries and trade associations. We believe that SureHarvest provides us with complementary solutions and services, a unique customer base and a valuable patent portfolio. It expands and diversifies our commodity reach with high value specialty crops, including wine grapes, almonds, hazelnuts, mushrooms, cut flowers, leafy greens and other fresh produce. Additionally, the SaaS model bundles annual software subscriptions with professional services to provide predictable, recurring revenue. 
  Acquisition of A Bee Organic LLC
On May 30, 2017, we acquired the business assets of A Bee Organic LLC (A Bee Organic) for $150,000 in cash and 45,684 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $98,000 based on the closing price of our stock on May 30, 2017, of $2.15 per share. The acquisition primarily consisted of the existing customer relationships and represents further expansion of our verification and certification solutions into hydroponics/aquaponics and apiary spaces.
  INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
The value-added food industry has been growing rapidly for the past several years in response to increased consumer interest about food production. Per the Food & Farm Facts book (2017 edition) produced by the American Farm Bureau Foundation, farm and ranch families comprise approximately 2 percent of the U.S. population; thus, there is a growing interest from consumers regarding how their food is produced. We are also in an increasingly global food market with food products traveling around the world, and brands differentiating themselves in the market. These key drivers are increasing the number of food labeling claims made on food products. Natural and/or organic are examples of food labels that indicate that the food or other agricultural product has been produced in a certain way.
 Natural and organic sales are only part of the story of how consumers look for the verification of practices tied to food labeling claims. Other factors are also becoming increasingly more important to consumers, evidenced on menus and product labels. While not an exhaustive list, some of the issues that farms, ranches, producers, processors, restaurants and retailers are addressing include how animals are cared for and handled, how a product’s production impacts the environment and societies, and what inputs were used in the production of food items (like antibiotics).
 As consumers want more assurance about the trustworthiness of labeling claims, there is a growing trend for verification of raising practices. Additionally, as the agriculture, livestock and food industry continues to mature and expand internationally, there is an increasing need to record, manage, report and verify information regarding the source, age, genetic background, animal treatment, nutrition, and other credence attributes. We believe verification of labeling claims by an independent third-party can meet consumer demands and expectations. Third-party verification also benefits producers, processors, distributors, restaurants, and retailers by addressing marketplace differentiation and global competitiveness.

 Current Marketplace Opportunities
Because of growing demand for increased transparency into food production practices, we believe there are three main market drivers to promote forward momentum for our business: 
   Market Driver #1 - Consumer awareness and expectations   
● | The 13th Edition of The Why? Behind The Buy, based on the annual survey conducted by Acosta, a leading full-service sales and marketing agency in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry, was released in December 2016. The survey found that today’s shoppers are seeking positive culinary experiences, making deliberate decisions from the store to the stove, including wanting to feel good about the foods they eat, have pride in the brands they buy and share their cooking journeys online. The survey also explores the key factors contributing to this experiential evolution for grocery shoppers, including the growing natural/organics category. Shoppers’ spending on health products has seen steady growth in the past several years, driven by the desire of shoppers to feel good about the foods they are eating. From online grocery ordering and a desire to explore new foods, to natural products and socially responsible brands, consumers are at the wheel when it comes to steering the CPG industry in a new direction. There’s no doubt that this evolution will continue in the coming year, so it’s up to the industry to adapt by leaning into these trends and building trust and loyalty among all shoppers,  said Colin Stewart, senior vice president at Acosta.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | According to research dated March 2016 from Sullivan Higdon & Sink FoodThink, only one-third of consumers believe that the agriculture community and food companies are transparent. The research appears in Evolving Trust in the Food Industry, a white paper with insights into Americans’ knowledge and trust of the food industry and how those perceptions have changed from 2012 to 2016. These numbers are an improvement from 2012, when only 22% and 19% agreed that the agricultural community and food companies, respectively, are transparent. Increasing media attention and dialogue about food production, and the food industry’s willingness to be more open about its production practices, have likely caused this increase in perceived transparency. In turn, this provides consumers the knowledge to have definite opinions on the degree of industry transparency and an increased desire for more knowledge about how their food is produced.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | According to the United States Department of Agriculture (the USDA) website, the U.S. market for certified organic products continues to grow in double digits with 24,650 operations at the end of 2016, which reflects a 13% growth rate between the end of 2015 and 2016. Increasing consumer demand for healthy, better-for-you products produced with sustainable agricultural practices is driving growth in the organic market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Market Driver #2 - Global competitiveness among retailers   
● | Restaurant chains and retailers with dominant market shares and large buying power, like McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, are leading the way in prioritizing sustainable food supply initiatives in response to consumer demands. With information literally at our fingertips, Google searches and smart phone apps are making it easier to expose where sustainable food supply chains are, and where they are not.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producers, packers, distributors and retailers understand that verification, identification and traceability are key competitive differentiators. Oftentimes, it is necessary for export into international markets, including Korea, Russia, China and the European Union. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market Driver #3 - Government regulation   
● | In January 2013, the Food Safety Modernization Act (the FSMA) issued two major proposed rules regarding preventive controls in human/animal food and produce safety. Compliance dates for some businesses began in September 2016. Under the new rules, the Food Safety Plan defined by the regulation differs from traditional hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) plans. It must include a hazard analysis, preventive controls, monitoring procedures, corrective action procedures, verification procedures, a supply chain program, and a recall program. We continue to see companies requesting our consulting expertise to develop programs designed to assist them in maintaining compliance with the new rules.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The Animal Disease Traceability Rule promulgated by the USDA primarily covers beef cattle 18 months of age or older. Under the final rule, unless specifically exempted, livestock moved interstate must be officially identified and accompanied by an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation, such as owner-shipper statements or brand certificates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Saudi Arabia market closed to U.S. beef in 2012. Since that time, the beef industry has been working with the U.S. government to re-open that market, which officially happened in early August 2016. In order to be approved to meet the export requirements, a company must have or must be approved by a USDA process verified plan and meet the Saudi Arabia export verification requirements. U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia in 2010 and 2011 were valued at approximately $30 million. We believe the Saudi Arabia market focuses on the highest quality middle meats, making it a valuable market for the U.S. to re-gain access.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On June 12, 2017, officials announced the technical requirements for beef exports to the People’s Republic of China. Export verification (EV) requirements include source and age verification with the use of a program compliant tag. In addition, China bans the use of synthetic growth promotants, including ractopamine. So, although there is not a formal non-hormone component to the EV requirements for the supply chain, due to China’s residue testing, packers will be seeking non-hormone treated cattle and/or verified natural cattle to ensure continued market access. China is the world’s second largest buyer of beef, but beef imports from the U.S. to China have been banned since the 2003 Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy outbreak, also known as Mad Cow Disease.

REVENUES
We offer a wide array of services, including verification, certification, consulting and SaaS, to help food producers, brands and consumers differentiate certain attributes and production methods in the marketplace. We sell our services directly to customers at various levels in the agriculture, food and livestock supply chain. Most of our service offerings can be bundled to provide a one-stop shop for customers that have multiple levels of verification and certification needs, such as source verification and food safety certification. Our customers include some of the largest U.S. beef and pork packers, organic producers and processors, and specialty retail chains. No single customer generated more than 10% of total net revenue in 2017 or 2016.
 With each acquisition, we assess the need to disclose discrete information related to our operating segments. Because of the similarities of certain of our acquisitions that provide certification and verification services, we aggregate operations into one verification and certification services reportable segment. The factors considered in determining this aggregated reporting segment include the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of services provided, production processes, types of customers and distribution methods. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Company’s CEO) allocates resources and assesses the performance of its certification and verification services activities as one segment, which includes product sales.
 With the acquisition of SureHarvest, the Company determined that it also has a software sales and related consulting services segment. This segment includes software license, maintenance, support and software-related consulting service revenues. 
 Management makes decisions, measures performance, and manages the business utilizing internal reporting operating segment information. Performance of operating segments are based on net sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and most importantly, operating income.

 Verification and Certification Segment
Our verification and certification service revenues consist of fees charged for verification audits and other verification and certification related services that the Company performs for customers. We include fees earned from our WFCF labeling program and consulting/program development services in our verification and certification revenues due to the immateriality of the revenue stream and because it represents a value-added extension of our source verification. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard setting bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they are making. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our third-party verification programs provided 79.8% and 89.8% of our total revenue, respectively.
 Our product sales are an ancillary part of our verification and certification services and represent sales of cattle identification ear tags. While our product sales have lower profit margins than do our proprietary offerings, the products allow us to offer our customers a comprehensive solution. Approximately 11.1% and 10.2% of our total revenue was generated by the sale of hardware during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
  Software Sales and Related Consulting Segment
Software license, maintenance and support services represents a new revenue stream specific to our acquisition of SureHarvest, as further described above. SureHarvest employs a SaaS revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry. 
 Software-related consulting service revenue primarily represents fees earned from professional appearances, customer education and training related services. It is a new revenue stream specific to our acquisition of SureHarvest, as further described above. 
  MARKETING
Our marketing strategy includes direct marketing, advertising, event sponsorship, and trade show participation. From a public relations perspective, members of our staff are frequently quoted in industry trade journals and requested as speakers at various industry events as subject matter experts on the topics of animal identification, traceability, branding, third-party verification and certification, and the USDA verification programs. 
 In order to reach additional customers, we continually develop strategic marketing partnerships with leading companies in the industry with complementary abilities and products. We do not currently rely on any third-party contracts with distributors, licenses or manufacturers in conducting our business. 
 We also use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help promote our business, market our product offerings, and connect consumers with current topics in the agriculture, livestock and food industry. 
  COMPETITION
The competition for third-party verification services in the food and agriculture industry is growing more intense, especially within the organic market. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that there are approximately eight key competitors serving the food and agricultural industry, including Quality Assurance International, California Certified Organic Farmers, Oregon Tilth, Organic Crop Improvement Association, Earth Claims, FoodChain ID, NSF International, SGS and SCS Global Services. Differentiation hinges upon understanding all facets of food verification and the complex compliance challenges to make product verifications efficient, cost-effective, and seamless. Our core business and expertise focus on the on farm verifications to a variety of standards, guidelines and criteria, including source verification, natural, animal care and well-being, and sustainability verification.

SEASONALITY
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue is typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. Because of the seasonality of the business and our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We create, own and maintain a variety of intellectual property assets that we believe are among our most valuable assets. Our intellectual property assets include patents and patent applications related to our innovations, products and services, trademarks related to our brands, products and services, and other property rights. We also have licensing arrangements when features from our programs are desirable to incorporate into either a new or an existing technology we offer. We seek to protect our intellectual property right assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries, and through contractual provisions. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we had 63 total employees, of which 54 were full-time employees. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our key senior management personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees is included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  ITEM 1A.          RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases, the following factors should be considered when evaluating our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects: 
   We operate in a competitive industry with a limited market characterized by changing technology, frequent introductions of new service offerings, service enhancements, and evolving industry standards.    We compete with many other vendors of products and services designed for tracking cattle and other livestock and for herd management and crop production practices. Our competitors range from small start-up companies to multi-national firms. Our competitors may have significantly more financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Competition is likely to intensify as current competitors expand their service offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances, and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Increasing competition may result in reduced margins and the loss of market share. Our competitors may offer broader service offerings or technologies that are more commercially attractive and gain greater market acceptance than our current or future products. Additionally, new technology may render our products and services obsolete. 
   The success of our business model depends on the broad acceptance of our technologies into markets that are continuing to develop as a result of the increasing focus on food safety and assurance.    We are currently benefiting from a slow but growing movement among the agriculture, livestock and food industry to source and/or age verify products. This emerging trend is fueled in part by consumers’ focus on food safety and assurance. However, we can offer no assurances that there will be market acceptance of our technologies. Furthermore, some of our primary target segments within the agriculture, livestock and food industry are experiencing unpredictable economic conditions and are expected to continue to struggle with supply, trade and profitability issues in the near term. Although we believe that our products, if adopted on a wide-scale basis, would have a significant impact on improving the safety, quality and confidence in the world’s food supply, our customers for these products historically have been very slow to change and reluctant to adopt new technologies and business practices.

 10

 
  We face risks of rapidly changing regulations which may negatively impact our programs.   Regulations and standards are continually evolving and present a challenging risk. For example, in January 2013, the Japanese government announced a change to its import requirements on U.S. beef. Because the change enabled a significant increase in the amount of product qualifying for export to Japan, it negatively impacted the premiums typically seen in the marketplace for source and age verified cattle. As a result, it negatively impacted our source and age verification business by approximately 68% from 2012 to 2013. Due to the diversification of our product offerings and our strategy of managing to profitability, we were able to quickly minimize the impact of these adverse changes. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by creating innovative programs that mitigate the risk of rapidly changing regulations, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming the potential negative impact to the results of our operations.
   We face risks that highly contagious diseases or viral outbreaks may negatively impact the source of product we are able to verify.    Today, infectious disease and viral outbreaks appear to be emerging more quickly than ever. For example, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv) negatively impacted the pork/sow industry in 2014 and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, more commonly known as Bird Flu, is currently impacting poultry operations. Additionally, contagious disease or viral outbreaks create increased bio-exclusion considerations in our business. While we have created innovative solutions that mitigate the risk of transferring disease, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming the potential negative impact to the results of our operations. 
   In the event that market demand for third-party verified products declines, our customers may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to justify the purchase of our verification solutions and consulting services.    Public attitudes towards food production practices may be influenced by claims that these products are unsafe for consumption or pose unknown health risks. For example, decreased demand for beef and other livestock products could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our existing or prospective customers. If operating results of our customers are impaired, the resources that our customers can devote to building information systems for tracking cattle and other livestock and herd management are reduced, which in turn may limit purchases of our verification solutions and consulting services. Therefore, our ability to generate revenue is subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to the financial condition of our customers. 
   We look for opportunities to expand our presence in international markets in which we may have limited experience, and inherently international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.    We continually seek to expand our product and service offerings in international markets. As we expand into new international markets, we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services in such markets. In other instances, we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets. Certain international markets may develop more slowly than do domestic markets, and our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment.
   11

 
In addition to uncertainty about our ability to expand into international markets, there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including, but not limited to: 
 
● | trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | difficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language and cultural differences; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | stringent local labor laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | longer payment cycles;
--+-----------------------


● | currency exchange rate fluctuations;
--+-------------------------------------


● | political or social unrest or economic instability;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | import or export restrictions;
--+-------------------------------


● | seasonal volatility in business activity;
--+------------------------------------------


● | risks related to government regulation or required compliance with local laws in certain jurisdictions, including those more fully described above; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potentially adverse tax consequences.
--+--------------------------------------


One or more of these factors could harm our future international operations and consequently could harm our brand, business, operating results and financial condition. 
   Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining our acquisitions and investments.   We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as: 
 
● | disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | problems retaining key personnel;
--+----------------------------------


● | additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including those that are a result of acquisitions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | for investments in which an acquired company’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on such company’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.

  Our future success depends upon our ability to obtain and enforce patents; prevent others from infringing on our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights; and operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others.    We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents and trademarks. Patent protection generally involves complex legal and factual issues and, therefore, the enforceability of patent rights cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In the event that patents owned by us do not provide adequate protection, we may not be able to prevent competitors from offering substantially similar products and services. 
 In the event that third parties claim that our current or future products or services infringe upon their intellectual property, we may face litigation and be prevented from selling the products and services at issue. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, and it is possible that past or future assertions or prosecutions could harm our business. Litigation either in defense of our intellectual property rights or in response to infringement claims made by others may be both expensive and time consuming, which in turn would adversely affect our business. 
   A significant data breach or information technology system disruption could adversely affect our business, financial results, or reputation, and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security.    We rely heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations. 
 Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, malware attacks, malicious employees or other insiders, telecommunications failures, human errors or catastrophic events. Hackers, foreign governments, cyber-terrorists and cyber-criminals, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages, gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information, or result in other interruptions in our business. In addition, breaches in security could expose us and our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. 
 We also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third parties for many aspects of our business operations, including our customers and service providers such as cloud service providers and third-party delivery services. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyber-attacks and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. Security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events, which could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, or misuse of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.

Any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems, or those of acquired businesses, customers, service providers or other third parties, could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, regulatory scrutiny, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. Among other consequences, our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations. Similarly, an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties.
 We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite our best efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. There is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future, and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful. 
   Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key senior management personnel, in particular, John and Leann Saunders.    Both John and Leann Saunders’ reputation and prominence in the field provide us with a strong competitive advantage. While they are currently bound by employment agreements, we can offer no assurance that John and/or Leann Saunders will be able to continue to work for us in the event of an unforeseen accident, severe injury or major disease, or on a long-term basis. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
   Directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially own or control a significant amount of our outstanding common stock and together meaningfully influence our activities.    As of March 23, 2018, John Saunders, our Chairman and CEO, and Leann Saunders, our President, beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 29% of our common stock. These officers, if they determine to vote in the same manner, would have a significant impact on the outcome of any matter requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions or terms of any liquidation. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other shareholders. This could prevent transactions in which shareholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.
   Because we are not presently subject to the same corporate governance standards as companies listed on registered stock exchanges or NASDAQ, our officers and directors may have interests adverse to those of the shareholders.    Registered stock exchanges and NASDAQ have enhanced corporate governance requirements that apply to issuers that list their securities on those exchanges. For example, we are not required to have any independent directors or to adopt a code of ethics. In certain circumstances, management may not have the same interests as the shareholders’ and conflicts of interest may arise. Notwithstanding the exercise of their fiduciary duties as directors and executive officers and any other duties that they may have to us or our shareholders in general, these persons may have interests different than yours which could adversely affect your investment.
   We do not currently intend to pay cash dividends.   We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. Our present policy is to retain all available funds for use in our business development, operations and expansion. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. In the absence of dividends, investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of our common stock appreciates.

  Future sales of our securities in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to continue to raise funds in new stock offerings.    It is likely that we will sell common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into common stock in order to finance our future growth plans. Future sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public or private markets would dilute our existing shareholders and potentially adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of securities. Alternatively, we may rely on debt financing and assume debt obligations that require us to make substantial interest and principal payments that could adversely affect our business and future growth potential. 
   Price volatility of our publicly traded securities could adversely affect investors’ portfolios.   In recent months and years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced high levels of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operating performance or prospects of such companies. It is likely that continual fluctuations in market and share prices will occur. Our shares of common stock trade on the OTCQB marketplace, which may not provide as much liquidity for our common stock as would a registered stock exchange. The price of our common stock has been subject to price and volume volatility in the past and will likely continue to be subject to such volatility in the future. In addition, unlike the registered stock exchanges, there are few corporate governance requirements imposed on OTCQB quoted companies. 
   Because our common stock is deemed a penny stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.   Since our common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment even if and when a market develops for our common stock. Until the trading price of our common stock rises above $5.00 per share, if ever, trading in our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act specified in Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:
 
● | deliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disclose certain price information about the stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | disclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | send monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in some circumstances, approve the purchaser’s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.

  As a public company, we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that require us to incur substantial expenses, and our financial controls and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable reporting of financial information, which, as a public company, could materially harm our stock price and listing on the OTCQB marketplace.    As a public company, we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance with many of these requirements is substantial, not only in absolute terms but, more importantly, in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. Failure to comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, our inability to file required periodic reports on a timely basis, loss of market confidence, delisting of our securities and/or governmental or private actions against us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage as compared with privately held and larger public competitors.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley (Section 404). Our compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may in the future be limited by a variety of factors, including:
 
● | faulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inappropriate management override of procedures; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | the possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be subject to delisting, investigations by the SEC and civil or criminal sanctions.
