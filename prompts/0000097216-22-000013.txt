ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Our Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986 as Terex U.S.A., Inc. Since that time, we have changed significantly, and much of this change has been historically accomplished through acquisitions and managing our portfolio of companies by divestiture of non-core businesses and products. Today, Terex is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms and materials processing machinery. We design, build and support products used in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, energy, minerals and materials management applications. Terex products and solutions enable customers to reduce their environmental impact including electric and hybrid offerings that deliver quiet and emission-free performance, products that support renewable energy, and products that aid in the recovery of useful materials from various types of waste. Our products are manufactured in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia and sold worldwide. We engage with customers through all stages of the product life cycle, from initial specification and financing to parts and service support. We continue to focus on becoming an industry leading operating company.
We report our business in the following segments: (i) Aerial Work Platforms (“AWP”) and (ii) Materials Processing (“MP”).

OTHER
We may assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through Terex Financial Services (“TFS”). TFS uses its equipment financing experience to facilitate financial products and services to assist customers in the acquisition of our equipment. On a global basis, TFS facilitates financing transactions directly between (i) end-user customers, distributors and rental companies and (ii) third-party financial institutions, providing recourse in certain circumstances. Most of the transactions are fixed and floating rate loans; however, TFS also facilitates sales-type leases, operating leases and rentals. In addition, wholesale financing may be arranged between dealers and distributors who sell our equipment and financial institutions with which TFS has established relationships.
TFS continually monitors used equipment values of Terex equipment in the secondary market sales channels for all of our equipment categories. This provides a basis to project future values of equipment for the underwriting of leases or loans. These secondary market sales channels may also be used for re-marketing any equipment which is returned at end of lease, or is repossessed in case of a customer default. If equipment is received, TFS uses the resale channel which maximizes proceeds and/or mitigates risk for Terex and our funding partners.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Mobile Cranes
On July 31, 2019, we completed the disposition of our Demag® mobile cranes business (“Demag”) to Tadano Ltd. and certain of its subsidiaries (“Tadano”). Products divested were our Demag® all terrain cranes and large lattice boom crawler cranes. During 2019, we also exited North American mobile crane product lines manufactured in our Oklahoma City facility. Our actions to sell Demag and cease the manufacturing of mobile crane product lines in our Oklahoma City facility represented a significant strategic shift in our business away from mobile cranes as these businesses constituted a significant part of our operations and financial results. We believe these actions were necessary to execute our strategy.
See Note D – “Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding dispositions and our discontinued operations.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Terex is a manufacturer of specialized capital equipment and related services. Our goal is to design, manufacture and market equipment and services that provide superior life-cycle return on invested capital to our customers (“Customer ROIC”). Customer ROIC is a key focus of our organization and is central to our ability to generate returns for investors.
We operate our Company based on our value system, “The Terex Way.” The Terex Way values shape the culture of our Company and reflect our collective commitment to and understanding of what it means to be a part of Terex. The Terex Way is based on six key values:
•Integrity: Integrity reflects honesty, ethics, transparency and accountability. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our business dealings and we never sacrifice our integrity for profit.
•Respect: Respect incorporates concern for safety, health, teamwork, diversity, equity, inclusion and performance. We treat all our team members, customers and suppliers with respect and dignity.
•Improvement: Improvement encompasses quality, problem-solving systems, a continuous improvement culture and collaboration. We continuously search for new and better ways of doing things, focusing on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste.
•Servant Leadership: Servant leadership requires service to others, humility, authenticity and leading by example. We work to serve the needs of our customers, investors and team members.
•Courage: Courage entails willingness to take risks, responsibility, action and empowerment. We have the courage to make a difference even when it is difficult.
•Citizenship: Citizenship means social responsibility and environmental stewardship. We comply with all laws, respect all people’s values and cultures, and are good global, national and local citizens.
Each business in our Company is unique, but all businesses are managed to a common set of expectations in three broad thematic areas, as defined by our “Execute, Innovate, Grow” operating framework.
The “Execute” theme involves expectations related to core operating processes and accountabilities. We expect our businesses to deploy processes that meet local needs while delivering a level of performance and predictability that is consistent with effective operations. These expectations are fulfilled differently by the various Terex businesses, but the core principles are the same. For example, our Genie business is managed to a defined set of processes that we call the Genie Business System. Our Materials Processing segment is managed to a similar set of processes that we call the MP Operating System. Both are key to delivering excellence across all functions within our operations. We feel that managing this way is key to appropriately balancing consistency and autonomy in our Company. Process discipline is important to efficient operation, but local control is important to the effectiveness with which business processes are implemented.
The “Innovate” theme focuses on purposeful development of step-change improvements in Terex offerings and in the efficiency with which these offerings are executed and supported. Innovation at Terex means doing things significantly better tomorrow than they have been done in the past by harnessing new thinking and applying technology in new and creative ways. Digitalization plays an important role in many of the innovations we pursue, but there are other aspects of this strategy that involve non-digital changes to the design of our products and improved ways of doing things.
The “Grow” theme is the outcome of doing “Execute” and “Innovate” well. We will successfully and profitably grow when we operate efficiently, apply new thinking in creating value for customers and take on new challenges through business investments (i.e. new category and geographic development). We also see a role for increased inorganic investment by adding scope or depth to our Company via acquisitions. We are actively building our inorganic investment pipeline, with an eye towards adding new dimensions to the Company portfolio and applying our skills as a manager of specialized machinery businesses in new and complementary domains.
Our Disciplined Capital Allocation approach remains an important part of our overall strategy, including maintenance of an optimal capital structure (~2.5 average net debt to EBITDA over the cycle), growth investments, restructuring investments and efficient return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
Successful pursuit of the “Execute, Innovate, Grow” strategy will shape the direction of our Company over the coming years. Terex is a diverse company that works collaboratively to deliver business performance efficiently and effectively. We balance the independence of our businesses with the benefits of total Company scale, which is central to how we manage our Company.

•Rough terrain cranes move materials and equipment on rugged or uneven terrain and are often located on a single construction or work site for long periods. Rough terrain cranes cannot be driven on highways (other than in Italy) and accordingly must be transported by truck to the work site.
•Tower cranes are often used in urban areas where space is constrained and in long-term or high-rise building sites. Tower cranes lift construction material and place the material at the point of use. We produce self-erecting, hammerhead, flat top and luffing jib tower cranes.
•Concrete mixer trucks are machines with a large revolving drum in which cement is mixed with other materials to make concrete. We offer models with custom chassis with configurations from three to seven axles.
•Our concrete pavers are used to finish bridges, canals, concrete streets, highways and airport surfaces.
BACKLOG
Our backlog as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions):

 | December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020
AWP | $ | 1,955.8 | | | $ | 825.6 
MP | 1,034.0 | | | 523.4 | 
Total | $ | 2,989.8 | | | $ | 1,349.0

We define backlog as firm orders that are expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts orders are generally filled on an as ordered basis.
Our management views backlog as one of many indicators of the performance of our business. Because many variables can cause changes in backlog and these changes may or may not be of any significance, we consequently view backlog as an important, but not necessarily determinative, indicator of future results.
Our overall backlog amounts at December 31, 2021 increased $1,640.8 million from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2020, due to higher orders across all business segments as our customers have increased capital spending in response to an improving global economic outlook.
AWP segment backlog at December 31, 2021 increased approximately 137% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2020. This increase from the prior year was driven by robust demand in all global markets as bookings continue to outpace billings.
MP segment backlog at December 31, 2021 increased approximately 98% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2020. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by higher demand across all MP businesses primarily in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
We maintain engineering staff primarily at our manufacturing locations to conduct research, development and engineering for site-specific products. We have also established competency centers that support entire segments from single locations in certain fields such as control systems. Our businesses assess global trends to understand future needs of our customers and help us decide which technologies to implement in future development projects. In addition, our engineering center in India supports our engineering teams worldwide through new product design, existing product design improvement and development of products for local markets. Continually monitoring our materials, manufacturing and engineering costs is essential to identifying possible savings, which then enables us to leverage those savings to improve our competitiveness and our customers’ return on investment. Our research, development and engineering expenses are primarily incurred to develop (i) additional applications and extensions of our existing product lines to meet customer needs, such as the telematics application to remotely monitor and manage our products, and take advantage of growth opportunities, and (ii) customer responsive enhancements and continuous cost improvements of existing products.
Our engineering focus mirrors the business priorities of delivering customer responsive solutions, growing in developing markets, complying with evolving regulatory standards in our global markets and applying our lean manufacturing principles by standardizing products, rationalizing components and strategically aligning with select global suppliers. Our engineering teams in China and India represent our commitment to engineering products for developing markets. They take equipment technology from the developed markets and translate it to appropriate technology for developing markets using the experience and cultural understanding of engineering teams native to those markets.
With the increased global awareness and customer demand for products that are not powered by carbon-based fuels, we continue to develop and incorporate alternative power solutions within our different product lines. Across our product range depending on product and application, various solutions are being deployed including battery-electric, fuel-electric hybrid and plug-in hybrids. In parallel to this we continue to research and evaluate alternative fuel options that may become viable solutions for our products in the future.
Product innovation has become a core element of our growth strategy. We have re-invigorated and increased our emphasis on creating new models and meeting the demands of our customers. Robust product development pipelines are in place, which we expect will continue to bring new, differentiated products to the market in the years ahead. We have also focused on producing more cost-effective product solutions across product families, as well as increasing commonalities of components to ease manufacturing processes.
We will continue our commitment to appropriate levels of research, development and engineering spending in order to meet our customer needs, uphold competitive functionality of our products and maintain regulatory compliance in all the markets we serve.

PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
We use proprietary materials such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade names in our operations and take actions to protect these rights.
We use several significant trademarks and trade names, most notably the Terex®, Genie®, Powerscreen® and Fuchs® trademarks. The other trademarks and trade names that we use include registered trademarks of Terex Corporation or its subsidiaries. 
We have many patents that we use in connection with our operations and most of our products contain some proprietary technology. Many of these patents and related proprietary technology are important to the production of particular products; however, overall, our patents, taken together, are not material to our business or our overall financial results.
Currently, we are engaged in various legal proceedings with respect to intellectual property rights. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in aggregate, on our business or operating performance. For more detail, see Item 3 – “Legal Proceedings.”
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
As part of The Terex Way, and our Zero Harm Safety and Environmental culture, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our team members, and strive to provide quality products that are safe to use and operate in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner. Safety is a top priority, not only for our team members, but also our customers. Terex has a longstanding commitment to designing, manufacturing, and selling safe and efficient products. Our safety standards and practices are rigorous.  We collaborate with customers to design features that help keep operators safe, improve working environments, and help maintain equipment uptime and utilization.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking appropriate precautions and implementing safeguards to protect our team members while they continue to meet our customers' needs around the world. We have implemented measures consistent with recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Practices include increased frequency of cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, following social distancing practices, mask usage when distancing practices are not possible and managing safe return to work for those impacted by COVID-19.
We generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances, should any such events occur. We are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment, machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards. Each of our manufacturing facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every five years to monitor compliance. Also, no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations. We are dedicated to ensuring that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. We are committed to reducing injuries and working towards a world-class level of safety practices in our industry.
We are dedicated to product safety when designing and manufacturing our equipment. Our equipment is designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their markets. We continually incorporate safety improvements in our products. We maintain an internal product safety team that is dedicated to improving safety and investigating and resolving any product safety issues that may arise.
Use and operation of our equipment in an environmentally conscious manner is an important priority for us. We are aware of global discussions regarding climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. We are increasing our production of products that have lower greenhouse gas emissions in response to both regulatory initiatives and market demand. We are active in the development of incorporating alternative power solutions within our different product lines. Globally, job site regulations have become increasingly stringent, requiring quieter equipment with lower or zero emissions. At the same time, for our Genie® equipment, more job sites are requiring machines capable of working both outdoors and indoors. Our customers want products that operate on battery electric and fuel-electric hybrid options. Many Genie® lift models offer all-electric or fuel-electric hybrid options that deliver quiet, emission-free performance, which is necessary for indoor working environments, as well as city centers with noise and emission restrictions. We offer crushers and screens that can operate from electrical power supply lines to help reduce the use of fuel. Hybrid solutions are also available on select utility aerial devices, cranes, and mixer trucks that use battery power to perform certain equipment functions without the engine running. Overall, we believe these developments are the leading edge of much greater change to the way equipment in the future will be powered. We have taken a lead on many of these developments within the industries we serve, and we will continue to evolve our approach to alternative, environmentally friendly equipment power as technical capabilities advance, solution economics improve, and customer demand for these solutions continues to increase.
Increasing laws and regulations dealing with the environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding safety and the environment has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures. We currently do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
SEASONAL FACTORS
Terex is a globally diverse company, supporting multiple end uses. Seasonality is a factor in some businesses, where annual purchasing patterns are impacted by the seasonality of downstream project spending. Specifically, our businesses can experience stronger demand during the second quarter, as customers in the northern hemisphere make investments in time for the annual construction season (April to October). Non-seasonal macro factors are also important and can surpass seasonal influences in importance in some years. Entering 2022, for example, we expect supply chain challenges to have greater influence on our sales than historical seasonal trends. As a result, in 2022, we expect sales to be highest in the second and third quarters, and expect our earnings generated in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half of the year.
WORKING CAPITAL
Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding to purchase production and replacement parts inventories and expenditures to repair, replace and upgrade existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including periodic interest payments on our outstanding debt. We believe cash generated from operations, including cash generated from the sale of receivables, loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets, will provide us with adequate liquidity to comply with our financial covenants under our bank credit facility, continue to support internal operating initiatives and meet our operating and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this annual report. See Item 1A. – “Risk Factors” for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business. We will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities, including reducing costs and working capital, reviewing alternatives for under-utilized assets, and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth opportunities.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
SAFETY
The safety of our team is our number one priority. At Terex, safety is an absolute way of life. We are committed to Zero Harm, and we expect all team members to be committed to safety and continuous improvement in this area. In 2016, Terex set the goals of reaching a 0.20 lost time injury rate and 1.00 total recordable injury rate by 2024. We have made good progress since 2016 when our lost time injury rate was 0.80 and our total recordable injury rate was 3.82. At the end of 2021, our lost time injury rate was 0.52 and our total recordable injury rate was 1.77. Our aspirational goal will always be zero injuries, but these goals represent milestones along our journey to Zero Harm.
TEAM MEMBER TALENT AND SUPPORT
Terex strives to attract, develop and retain the best people to be part of our team. We have a diverse and highly engaged global workforce. Capable, highly skilled and diverse team members are key to our ability to implement our “Execute, Innovate, Grow” strategy.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 8,600 team members, including approximately 3,700 team members in the U.S. Approximately one percent of our team members in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. Outside of the U.S., we enter into employment contracts and collective agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. We generally consider our relations with our team members to be good and we provide mechanisms such as surveys and helplines for our team members to provide their perspectives. In 2021, 81% of team members participated in our company-wide global engagement survey. Safety remained the highest rated survey category and we received positive net promoter scores.
We have a robust talent review process in which we assess talent strengths and opportunity areas, matching our team members’ career aspirations with the needs of the business. We offer a wide range of training programs to support team members in their current roles and in achieving advancement opportunities. Our core curriculum of Terex Success Programs are designed for all of our team members from individual contributors to front line supervisors to managers and executives. These programs are grounded in The Terex Way values and help participants build key skills. Additional training programs are offered around specific topics such as Safety; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”); Technical Skills; and Financial Fundamentals.
We have a strong performance management process that includes annually setting clear business and professional objectives, mid-year calibration, annual performance reviews and succession planning. Both team members and managers play active roles in the performance management process, furthering a culture of accountability that supports team member development.
We design our benefits and programs to support the way our team members live and work. We care about our team members. For example, our Global Employee Assistance Program is in place to support team members who are facing challenges in their personal lives. Where we can, we offer a flexible work environment, enabling team members to manage the demands of their personal and professional lives.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
We are committed to increasing and retaining demographic diversity at all levels of our global workforce. We extend a warm welcome to team members of every race, gender, age, religion, identity or experience. We encourage, value and support non-majority team members in all of our facilities worldwide. We actively seek their engagement and partnership, as we understand that diversity of background, thought and experience leads to improved problem-solving and greater innovation.
Diversity in and of itself is not sufficient. We strive to be fair and impartial in our decisions, ensuring Equity within our workplace. By doing so, we create a sense of Inclusion and belonging for all our team members. We are committed to DEI so we can make Terex the kind of place where every team member feels valued, listened to and appreciated.
Our Company has a vibrant, global initiative to increase representation of women in our workplace because we recognize that women are often under-represented in manufacturing organizations such as ours. We are making excellent progress, requiring diverse candidate slates, supporting women through mentoring, training, and colleague-to-colleague education, and using our talent development process to identify qualified women for their next role(s) within our organization. In 2014, we established five-year goals to increase representation in three areas: women in leadership, women in line roles (like operations, engineering and sales) and women overall. Having made progress against these goals, we have extended them for another five years.
In 2020, we committed to expand our primary DEI focus areas to include race and ethnicity, to ensure that members of under-represented groups have a sense of belonging and can thrive within our organization. We intentionally defined our DEI aspirations, initially focusing on our U.S. workforce. We have set aspirations to increase the representation of non-majority team members in leadership, management, indirect manufacturing and indirect selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) roles.
In 2021, we implemented actions to help achieve our aspirations, by creating a DEI governance structure that includes a DEI Governance Council; regional DEI Councils in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Russia (EMEAR) and Asia Pacific; our longstanding Women@Terex Steering Committee; and eight global Affinity Groups. The DEI Governance Council is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Human Resources Officer; our regional councils have Executive Leadership Team (“ELT”) level sponsorship from our segment Presidents. Our DEI efforts are centered around recruitment, engagement, development and retention. We have completed training for our ELT, senior leadership, managers and the HR community. This training will be cascaded to our more junior managers and supervisors as well. We continue to develop tools and resources for use at the individual and site level to foster inclusion. For 2022, we are introducing a component to our annual incentive plan that will be focused on the achievement of specific DEI metrics.
