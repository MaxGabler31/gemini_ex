ITEM 1. Business
General
 Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes, and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes, and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. More than 60% of our products are manufactured in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts, or Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. All our partners manufacture to our strict specifications and per our supplier code of conduct. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets. The Company’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and “engineered solutions” based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
 Our fiscal year 2022 began on May 30, 2021 and ended on May 28, 2022, our fiscal year 2021 began on May 31, 2020 and ended on May 29, 2021 and our fiscal year 2020 began on June 2, 2019 and ended on May 30, 2020. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
 COVID-19 Update
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to evolve. As such, the full magnitude that the pandemic, and the steps taken to prevent, mitigate and/or respond to its spread, will have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations is uncertain. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the duration and spread of the pandemic, the extent, speed and effectiveness of continued worldwide containment efforts, and other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to abatement and resurgence of the disease. Our ability to meet customer demands for products may be impaired or, similarly, our customers may experience adverse business consequences due to the continued impact of COVID-19 and its effects. 
 Reduced demand for products or impaired ability to meet customer demand (including disruptions at our transportation service providers or vendors) could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial performance. There were sales declines during fiscal year 2021, the majority of which were related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. While the Company did not experience sales declines during fiscal year 2022 as a result of the pandemic, the impacts from the pandemic negatively impacted our gross margins as a percentage of net sales in our Canvys and Healthcare segments.
 As a result of COVID-19 and its effects, we experienced some COVID-19 related component delays impacting new product development schedules. The global markets have generally suffered, and are continuing to suffer, from material disruptions in the supply chain. 
 Management continues to monitor the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. Given the ever-evolving nature of the pandemic and the continued global responses to the ongoing impact of the pandemic as well the cycle of recurrences and the after-effects, the Company is not presently able to fully estimate the effects of COVID-19 on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity going forward.
 Company Response to CARES Act
 On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The CARES Act included provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified, improvement property. As of May 28, 2022, the Company deferred $0.4 million of employer-side social security tax payments, which will be made by December 31, 2022. The Company has estimated and recorded the overall effects of the CARES Act and does not anticipate a material change.
 Government Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulatory requirements relating to our operations. These laws and regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, privacy and data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property, corporate governance, tax, trade, antitrust,

employment, import/export, anti-corruption, and environmental regulatory compliance. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the ordinary course of our business and do not represent material expenditures and we further do not currently expect that compliance with such laws will require us to make material additional expenditures, however, there is no assurance that existing or future laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, and services will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Among others, we are subject to a variety of data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy and/or cybersecurity laws in the United States. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, reputational impacts, and other costs. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations complicate our operations and add to our costs.
 
We are also subject to various domestic and international export, trade and anti-corruption laws, such as include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), anti-money laundering laws and regulations and the trade and trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.
 
Our operations also are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
 
For more information on risks related to the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the relevant discussions throughout "Item 1A, Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Geography
 We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is set forth in Note 9, Segment and Geographic Information, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of   this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We have three operating and reportable segments. Starting with our first quarter earnings release in October for fiscal 2023, we will introduce our new Green Energy Solutions (“GES”) segment. This segment is carved out of our existing PMT segment as we continue to focus on power management applications that support the green energy market globally. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we will begin reporting on four segments.
 The three operating and reportable segments for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 are defined as follows:
 Power and Microwave Technologies 
 Power and Microwave Technologies (“PMT”) combines our core engineered solutions capabilities, power grid and microwave tube business with new disruptive RF, Wireless and Power technologies. As a designer, manufacturer, technology partner and authorized distributor, PMT’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities on a global basis. We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair—all through our existing global infrastructure. PMT’s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in 5G, alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar and radiation oncology. PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
 PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and RF, Microwave and power components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, RF and wireless and industrial power applications. Among the suppliers PMT supports are Amperex, CDE, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MACOM, National, NJRC, Ohmite, Qorvo, Thales, Toshiba and Vishay.
 PMT’s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment and designing in new technologies. PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology. While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining,

PMT is increasing its market share. PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases and extended lead times. As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
 PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights that often include global coverage. The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches that are not cured within a reasonable period. Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
 PMT’s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers. For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies and Disclosures, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including Amperex®, Cetron® and National®. Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, Ultracapacitor modules and liquid crystal display monitors. The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics and a wide variety of fabricated metal components. These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.

 Human Capital Management
 Recruitment & Staffing 
 The future success of our Company depends on our ability to attract, hire, motivate, retain and further develop top talent, including highly skilled technical, management and sales personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Competition for such personnel is intense and the salary, benefits and other costs to employ the right personnel may impact our results and performance.
 As of May 28, 2022, we employed 447 individuals, which included 411 full-time individuals and 36 part-time individuals. Of these, 287 full-time and 19 part-time were located in the United States and 124 full-time and 17 part-time were located internationally. All of our employees are non-union and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
 The Company offers employees a competitive compensation program, designed to recognize and reward both individual and company performance, which includes a base pay, variable compensation programs, and health, wellbeing and retirement programs to meet the needs of our employees. The health, safety and wellness of our employees is a priority. In light of COVID-19, many of our employees work from home whenever possible and additional safety measures were implemented for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging
 
We are an international company with offices and personnel located around the world. We understand, respect, and value the similarities as well as the differences of our employees. Our human capital is a critical asset that enables us to serve and support our global customer base. Our effectiveness in maximizing the talents of people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives is key to our continued global success. Fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is a key priority for the Company. We seek to embrace and encourage our employees’ differences in age, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique.

Management has identified Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (“DEI&B”) as a priority for our Company.  Significant positive change requires careful planning, leadership, resources, and coordination. The Company established a DEI&B committee to plan and implement changes to achieve our goal of being a more diverse and inclusive organization. The DEI&B committee has been charged with making recommendations about how we, as a company, can promote and act upon the Company’s initiatives in this area. The committee will identify priorities based on employee input and incorporate these into the Company’s strategic plans, work to establish accountability and methods of measuring our progress, and provide appropriate communications about our plans and achievements to our stakeholders. To date, DEI&B initiatives have focused on the following:
  
• | Expanded the Board of Directors to include a female director
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased DEI&B awareness throughout the Company by education and involvement
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Added socially responsible funds to our 401K Plan
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Providing regular training, communication, activities, and surveys regarding DEI&B matters to our employees
