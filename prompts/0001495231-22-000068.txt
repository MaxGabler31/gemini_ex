ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Our Mission
Our mission is to champion the world's creators by helping them monetize their content, creativity, and influence.
Corporate Information
IZEA Worldwide, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” “IZEA,” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation that was founded in February 2006 under the name PayPerPost, Inc. and became a public company in May 2011. In January 2015, IZEA purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Ebyline, Inc. (“Ebyline”). In March 2016, we formed IZEA Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Ontario, Canada, to provide sales and support for IZEA's Canadian customers. In July 2016, IZEA purchased all the outstanding shares of capital stock of ZenContent, Inc. (“ZenContent”) and, in July 2018, a subsidiary of the Company merged with TapInfluence, Inc. (“TapInfluence”). ZenContent, Ebyline, and TapInfluence were merged into IZEA in December 2017, December 2019, and December 2020, respectively. 
Our Company is based in Orlando, Florida, but intends to operate as a virtual-first company, with all of our employees working remotely since March 16, 2020.
Our Business
We create and operate online marketplaces that connect marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, with content creators such as Instagram influencers, TikTok influencers, YouTube stars, designers, photographers, and writers (“creators”). Marketers also engage us to gain access to our industry expertise, data, and analytics. Our primary technology platform, the IZEA Exchange (“IZEAx”), is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of content to be completed at scale. 
We provide value through managing custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. While the majority of marketers engage us to perform these services (the “Managed Services”) on their behalf, they may also use our marketplaces to engage creators for influencer marketing campaigns or to produce custom content on a self-service basis by licensing our technology. 
Influencer Marketing. We work with marketers to enable influencer marketing campaigns at scale. A subset of influencer marketing known as “Sponsored Social” is when a company compensates creators to share sponsored content with the creators’ social network followings. This sponsored content is within the body of the content stream. We believe that we pioneered the concept of a marketplace for sponsorships on the social web in 2006 with the launch of our first platform, PayPerPost. We have focused on scaling our product and service offerings ever since, including acquiring TapInfluence in July 2018 and launching Shake and BrandGraph in 2020.
Custom Content. We also work with marketers to augment or replace their content development efforts. Our network of creators produces editorial and marketing content that can be published both online and offline. Our network of creators includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers, and everyday content creators, allowing our customers to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Many of our content customers use this service to create a steady stream of posts for their corporate blogs. We first began offering custom content services in 2015 after acquiring Ebyline, a leading marketplace in the editorial content space, and continued to expand this offering with our acquisition of ZenContent in July 2016, a company that predominantly focused on e-commerce-related asset creation.
Our Platforms
IZEAx.  The platform is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through our creators’ websites, blogs, and social media channels, including, among others, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram. We extensively use this platform to manage influencer marketing campaigns on behalf of our marketers. This platform is also available directly to our marketers as a self-service tool and a licensed white label product. IZEAx was engineered from the ground up to replace all of our previous platforms with an integrated offering that is improved and more efficient. 
BrandGraph. In March 2020, we launched BrandGraph, a social media intelligence platform. BrandGraph is heavily integrated with IZEAx, and both platforms rely heavily on data from each other, but it is also available as a stand-alone platform. BrandGraph offers marketers an analysis of share-of-voice, engagement benchmarking, category spending estimates, influencer identification, and sentiment analysis. The platform maps and classifies the complex hierarchy of corporation-to-brand relationships by category and associates social content with brands through a proprietary content analysis engine. It aggregates and analyzes content data to provide insights for marketers across their competitive landscapes that are particularly useful to influencer marketing professionals, including our managed services team.
Shake. In November 2020, we launched Shake, a new online marketplace where buyers can quickly and easily hire creators of all types for influencer marketing, photography, design, and other digital services. The Shake platform is aimed at digital creators seeking freelance “gig” work. Creator’s list available “Shakes” on their accounts on the platform. Marketers select and purchase creative packages from them through a streamlined chat experience, assisted by ShakeBot - a proprietary, artificial intelligence assistant. 
Legacy Platforms
Ebyline. In January 2015, we acquired Ebyline and its technology platform to source and compensate creators for the creation and delivery of professional editorial content. Ebyline was initially designed as a self-service content marketplace to replace editorial newsrooms located in the news agencies with a “virtual newsroom” of creators to produce their content needs and handle their workflow. After the acquisition, we began to utilize the creators in the Ebyline platform to create professional custom content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. We have been incorporating certain functions of this platform into IZEAx to have one consolidated platform in the future. By December 2019, we migrated all remaining customers into our IZEAx platform and dissolved the Ebyline entity.
ZenContent. In July 2016, we acquired ZenContent, including its custom content creation workflow technology and database of creators. ZenContent’s platform enabled us to produce highly scalable, multi-part content for e-commerce entities and brand customers. The ZenContent platform allowed us to parse work out to a wide array of qualified creators who together could develop custom content assets with unmatched quality, speed, and price. Our campaign fulfillment team utilized this platform to service orders for custom content until December 2020. 
TapInfluence. In July 2018, we acquired TapInfluence and its technology platform. TapInfluence marketed and sold software-as-a-service “SaaS” software complementary to IZEA’s existing influencer marketing products and services. We incorporated certain functions of this platform into IZEAx and improved influencer discovery and content workflow to have one consolidated platform. Throughout 2019, users of this platform were migrated over to IZEAx. We discontinued the use of this platform in March 2020.
IZEAx, BrandGraph, Shake, Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence were designed with the same purpose: to streamline transactions between our internal campaign fulfillment team, marketers, and creators. We utilize these proprietary technologies to create efficiencies and economies of scale for all parties. These platforms' knowledge base and technology provide marketers with access to an extensive network of creators and complete workflow management, content control, payment processing, and related performance tracking. 
We believe that IZEAx improves our ability to efficiently match marketplace participants as the number of marketers and creators using the platform increases. To date, we have completed over 3.9 million influencer and content marketing transactions for customers ranging from small local businesses to Fortune 500 companies. We consider each piece of custom content, sponsored post, or other updates as an individual transaction so long as the creator of that content is being compensated for the transaction.
Industry Background and Trends
When IZEA first launched PayPerPost in 2006, the concept of a brand paying bloggers to create sponsored content on their blogs was highly controversial among marketers and content creators. The idea was introduced when there were no ads on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter, and social media was largely void of corporate marketing messages. Over the past fifteen years, the landscape has dramatically changed. Today, strategic engagement of online influencers is table stakes for modern brands - largely in part to changes in consumer behavior and the large-scale adoption of social media platforms. Similarly, those same companies are now producing custom marketing content for their social channels and embracing influencer marketing as a means to reach their customers. 
While industry research indicates that brand spending on influencer and content marketing has grown dramatically in the last several years, the business processes and practices have not evolved in a meaningful way for the majority of buyers and sellers. The markets that we operate in are highly fragmented, highly competitive, and primarily limited by the current inefficiencies inherent in our space. Most marketers have been forced to utilize a variety of execution partners and manual processes to navigate the complicated landscape, often resulting in low returns on their time investment or, worse-yet, questionable results. We believe this is mainly due to marketers and creators lacking an efficient way to identify and engage each other in a marketplace of scale. 
At the same time, influencers and content creators seeking to monetize their communities and work product face significant challenges in making marketers aware of their services and finding quality brands motivated to sponsor them. In addition, those creators with smaller followings lack the individual influence and audience needed to warrant the processing of a micro-transaction. In many cases, it costs a marketer more money to issue a traditional check to a nano influencer than the value of the sponsorship payment itself. Further complicating the sponsorship process for both parties are federal regulations around social media endorsements, tax reporting generally applicable to anyone receiving income for services, and the 
associated campaign tracking required to provide compliance. While many marketers would prefer to be “part of the conversation,” we believe the complexity and cost of individual sponsorship often deter them from doing so.
We believe that addressing the current efficiency and measurable success challenges via technology represents a significant opportunity. IZEA ultimately solves these challenges with targeted, scalable marketplaces that aggregate content creators and marketers. In doing so, we offer an efficient, innovative way for creators and marketers of all sizes to find each other and form a compensated relationship.
Our Business Model
Since our inception in 2006, we have worked diligently to establish and leverage key strengths in our business model, including:
A culture of innovation and creativity. We believe the only way to survive and thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. We are in a state of constant evolution and re-invention; this is “The IZEA Way.” We have created a culture committed to innovation and creativity that challenges convention, takes calculated risks, and breaks new ground. IZEA team members are protective and proud of our culture by applying its “humble, yet hungry” attitude to all facets of our business. Our people and their innovations ultimately provide us with what we see as our most significant competitive advantage. 
First-mover advantage. We believe that by pioneering the modern influencer marketing industry and investing heavily in innovation, acquisitions, and marketing, we have acquired a vast amount of industry knowledge, market insights, and technology. Over time, the software foundation we have built is expansive with the amount of actionable data we have accumulated from our network of creators and the execution of customer programs. Those new to the space face a significant technology investment requirement and steep learning curve to compete in a complex and rapidly evolving industry.
Best in class technology. We believe that the feature sets in our platforms are among the most comprehensive for those seeking to execute influencer marketing campaigns. While our industry has a broad and fragmented set of competitors offering various technology solutions, we have developed a complete, enterprise-grade solution for those seeking to execute large-scale influencer marketing campaigns from beginning to end.
Experienced management team, board of directors, and strategic advisors. Our management team includes a highly experienced team of entrepreneurs and executives from the digital media, technology, and entertainment industries and outstanding board members, who are experts in their respective fields. See Item 10 under Part III of this Annual Report for details.
Our Growth Strategy 
After over fifteen years of working in and developing the influencer and content marketing categories, we believe our business model is market-tested, and our industry is well-established. Our development efforts have included assembling a diverse and experienced senior management team and engineering team, launching, and optimizing our proprietary marketplaces, developing a cross-platform sales force, and refining our message to the market. Key elements of our strategy to accelerate revenue growth and continue product development include: 
Software + Service. IZEA’s flexible client engagement model appeals to agency and brand customers with various need states. We structure content and influencer marketing programs that align with our customers’ goals, resources, and profiles. IZEA clients can license our software to run their programs, hire our team for fully outsourced managed services, or engage us in a hybrid model that combines access to our software with collaborative execution.
Product development. Since 2009, we have invested over $34.1 million in engineering resources and product development, creating a meaningful competitive moat of features and functionality in our platform. We continue to recruit additional engineering and product innovation team members to enhance IZEAx, Shake, and BrandGraph, and to develop new technology ideas within these platforms that complement our mission as a company. 
Large network of users. IZEA is a driving force in the broader “creator economy,” allowing everyone from college students and stay-at-home individuals to celebrities and accredited journalists the opportunity to monetize their content, creativity, and influence through our platform. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 996,500 user accounts in IZEAx. These accounts have connections to over 1,080,000 social media accounts with an approximate aggregate reach of 10.7 billion non-unique fans and followers of IZEAx creators. Our total number of user accounts may be higher than our actual individual creators because some creators may have created multiple user accounts.
 Creators can join our platforms for free, but they may also choose to pay to upgrade their accounts to enable additional services and benefits. We compensate these individuals for producing content for our market clients or distributing it on behalf of brands through their websites, blogs, and social media channels. We continually seek ways to increase our creators’ ability to generate revenue. 
By continually developing our creator network, we make our marketplace more attractive to our customers who seek a wide variety of creators to fulfill their content and advertising needs. As marketers utilize our marketplace to a greater extent, we expect to increase the monetization opportunities for creators, which should, in turn, attract even more creators and further enhance value for our marketers. 
Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell influencer marketing and custom content campaigns through our sales team and platforms. We target regional, national, and global brands and advertising agencies in the following ways:
Client Development Team.  Our client development team is assigned a geographic region or specific markets, primarily within the United States and Canada. Team members are responsible for identifying and managing sales opportunities to brands and agencies seeking to outsource some or all of the planning and production of their content and advertising needs.
SaaS Sales Team.  The SaaS Sales team initiates SaaS license opportunities with brands and agencies who seek to utilize additional functionality on our platforms on a self-service basis to facilitate custom content and influencer marketing campaigns.
Self-Service.  IZEA offers a version of IZEAx, called IZEAx Discovery, tailored to customers focused only on identifying influencers. Customers who need influencer discovery software can license this technology by signing up directly with a credit card on the IZEA website without speaking to a sales representative. Our Shake platform is 100% self-service and has no sales team. Marketers who would like to hire creators do so by entering their credit card information on the Shake website to purchase a “Shake” from a creator. 
Industry Acumen. Our team possesses strong marketing and advertising background. We focus our corporate marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating each of our platform advantages, generating qualified leads for our sales team, growing our creator network, and driving self-service sign-ups to our platforms. Our corporate marketing plan is designed to continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our software and services. We rely on a growing number of channels in this area, including third-party social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and YouTube), paid search engine marketing, content marketing, influencer marketing, and virtual events.
Customers and Revenue
We generate revenue from four primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency, or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification, or other campaign management services (“Managed Services”); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend within our IZEAx and Shake platforms (“Marketplace Spend Fees”); (3) revenue from license and subscription fees charged to access the IZEAx and BrandGraph platforms (“License Fees”); and (4) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and other miscellaneous fees charged to users of our platforms (“Other Fees”). 
As discussed in more detail within “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” under “Note 1. Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Part I, Item 7 herein, revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees is reported on a net basis. Revenue from all other sources, including Managed Services, License Fees, and Other Fees, are reported on a gross basis. We further categorize these sources into two primary groups: (1) Managed Services and (2) SaaS Services, which includes revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees, License Fees, and Other Fees.
We provide services to customers in multiple industry segments, including consumer products, retail/e-tail, lifestyle, technology, and travel. Our business serves advertising and public relations agencies, brands, and companies directly. In many cases, influencer marketing dollars flow through the advertising or public relations agency, even when we have a direct relationship with the brand. 
We generate the majority of our revenue from our Managed Services customers. Managed Services accounted for approximately 94% and 87% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. SaaS Services accounted for approximately 6% and 13% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
Changes in how we control and manage our platforms, contractual terms, business practices, or other changes in accounting standards or interpretations may change our revenue reporting. See “Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information as it relates to our revenue recognition policies.
The majority of our customers are located in the United States and Canada. We had one customer that accounted for 14% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and one customer that accounted for 13% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Revenue from our Canadian customers accounted for approximately $0.6 million (2%) and $1.0 million (6%) of our revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
Technology 
IZEAx and Shake span multiple social networks and digital creative services. We aggregate creators in our platforms, which allows us to create scale and choice for marketers. We provide the ability to find and collaborate with our creators based on a variety of software rules, filters, and data enrichment. Our self-service platforms service all business types and sizes, ranging from Fortune 500 customers to small agencies and brands. We provide trackable results for influencer marketing campaigns by automatically embedding tracking links and pixels and support for third-party tracking. IZEA technology includes content review and approval, dashboards for real-time reporting, and digital asset management. 
Privacy and Security
We are committed to protecting the personal privacy of our marketers and creators. Any personal information that we collect is processed under our Privacy Notice, and we employ reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect personal information. 
Product Development
Our product development team is responsible for platform and infrastructure development, application development, user interface, application design, enterprise connectivity, Internet applications and design, quality assurance, documentation, and release management. Among our core strengths is our knowledge of and experience in launching and operating scalable content and influencer marketing marketplaces. Our product development expenses include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our development team, along with hosting and software subscription costs. These costs were approximately $5.9 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are included in general and administrative expenses. 
We launched IZEAx in March 2014 and unveiled our latest version 3.0 of the platform in April 2019. We continue to add new features and additional functionality to this platform each year. These new features enable our platform to facilitate the contracting, workflow, and delivery of direct content and provide for invoicing, collaborating, and direct payments for our SaaS customers. We incurred and capitalized software development costs of zero and $363,793 in our balance sheet during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our team believes that relentless innovation is the only way to achieve long-term growth. We consistently invest in new technology inside and outside of our current software platforms. The launch of Shake and BrandGraph during the pandemic in 2020 underscores that commitment. We intend to continue to invest in creating new technology additions that complement our core offerings. 
Competition 
We face competition from multiple companies in the influencer and content marketing categories. Direct and indirect competitors in the influencer marketing space include Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Linqia, and Upfluence. We also face competition in the creator economy from companies such as Fiverr and Upwork. In addition, there are many traditional advertising agencies, public relations firms, and niche consultancies that provide content development and conduct manual influencer outreach programs.
Competition could result in significant price pressure, declining margins, and reductions in our revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services with IZEAx, Shake, and BrandGraph, we may compete with a greater number of other companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition, and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
We also compete with traditional advertising media such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print for a share of marketers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. 
Proprietary Rights
Proprietary rights are crucial to our success and competitive position. To evolve and secure our proprietary rights, we rely on intellectual property and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 51 trademarks (35 domestic trademark registrations in the United States and 16 foreign registrations on the International Register) and had 10 total pending applications in the United States, Canada, and Nigeria. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we abandoned 2 inactive U.S. trademarks. As of December 31, 2021, we also owned approximately 343 domain names related to the various aspects of IZEA’s products and services.
Government Regulation 
We are subject to many foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted by regulators or in the courts in ways that could adversely affect our business model. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by several claims. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, and online payment services. In addition, governments may seek to censor content available on our platforms or attempt to block access to our platforms. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business.
We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing privacy, information security, and data protection laws (“Privacy Laws”). Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising Privacy Laws. All U.S. states have passed data breach notification laws, and others have adopted or expanded laws and regulations that address the security of personal information and the collection and use of personal information through websites. In particular, California passed a broad-reaching consumer privacy law in June 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, called the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). In response to the CCPA, IZEA posted an updated California Privacy Notice on its websites. Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) will come into effect on January 1, 2023, which is also when the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) will take effect. The U.S. Congress also is considering the implementation of a national Privacy Law. Outside the U.S., the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective May 25, 2018, has an extra-territorial scope and substantial fines (up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20M, whichever is greater). In 2018, Brazil passed a law similar to GDPR and other countries are considering similar laws. Enforcement of Privacy Laws also has increased over the past few years. Accordingly, new and revised Privacy Laws, together with stepped-up enforcement of existing Privacy Laws, could significantly affect our current and planned privacy, data protection, information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention, and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. 
The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit but do not eliminate our liability for linking to third-party websites. These websites may contain materials that infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We must comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
As an e-commerce service provider, we are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 (the “FTC Act”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including advertising and marketing on the Internet. Many states have consumer protection laws similar to the FTC Act with the purpose of prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. In some instances, we are retained by marketers to manage their advertising campaigns through our platforms, thereby increasing our exposure as not only the service provider but also the medium through which advertisements are broadcast. In addition to those requirements, the marketers, creators, and agencies that use our platforms are subject to specific guidelines and regulations regarding online advertising, such as the Dot Com Disclosures - Information about Online Advertising, issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the FTC’s Enforcement Policy Statement on Deceptively Formatted Advertisements, issued in 2015, and the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (known as the Endorsement Guide) which were adopted in 2009, updated and reissued by the FTC in 2013, and further clarified in 2015 and are regularly enforced. The Endorsement Guide, for example, significantly extends the scope of potential liability associated with the use of testimonials and endorsements, including injecting endorsement requirements into advertising methods such as blogging, posting on Instagram, tweeting, and other online postings of sponsored advertisements by a creator. In particular, the Endorsement Guide provides that creators must always clearly and conspicuously disclose the material connection between the creator and the marketer, such as if they received consideration for blogging or posting about a particular product, service, brand, or the like, whether the consideration comprises something tangible (i.e. cash, discounts, objects that are provided to them at no cost, even for testing purposes) or intangible (such as accolades and more prominent future blogging or posting opportunities). In addition, the creator must not make claims about the product or service they are discussing that go beyond what the marketer could say about the product or service. The Endorsement Guide further provides that the marketer should ensure that creators speaking on its behalf are provided guidance and training needed to ensure their claims, statements, and representations are truthful, transparent, and properly substantiated, and monitor the activities of creators speaking on its behalf. If a creator, blogger, agency, or marketer should fail to comply with the Dot Com Disclosures, the Endorsement Guide, or any other FTC rule, regulation, or policy, which may be manifest by making deceptive, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims and representations, failing to disclose a sponsorship relationship or otherwise, then various parties related to the advertising campaign (including the service provider of the platform over which the campaign is managed) may be subject to liability as a result of such non-compliance. In the event it was found that we (or one of our marketer customers) failed to comply with the FTC Act or state consumer protection laws, it could result in the potential imposition of equitable redress or penalties that could include monetary damages, a modification of certain business practices, or an order to cease 
certain aspects of our operations. Other countries, such as Canada and EU member states, also have laws, regulations, and rules that mirror the FTC Endorsement Guide and similar consumer protection laws and guidance.
More generally, if there is negative consumer perception and mistrust of the practice of compensating creators to endorse the marketers' specific products, then marketers may become less interested in using influencer marketing platforms like ours as a means for advertising which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
We are committed to promoting ethical social sponsorship practices and have established terms of service for users of our platforms, which refer to the Endorsement Guide and include one or more of the following:
Mandatory Disclosure. Our terms of service require the disclosure of the sponsored relationship between the marketer and creator. By default, a “sponsorship” cannot be published through the platform unless a phrase or paragraph disclosing the sponsored relationship is included. For example, a creator is required to select one of several disclosure phrases such as “sponsored,” “advertisement” or “ad” before the publication of a tweet or a post. Other social sponsorship forms may be monitored through a Disclosure Audit tool that monitors posts on an ongoing basis to ensure they continue to include disclosure after the initial posts are approved. Failure to disclose the sponsored relationship violates our terms of service, which may result in the withholding of payment for the sponsorship and the creator being removed from our network.
Freedom of Choice. Creators are free to choose which sponsorships to publish. Our platforms do not auto-inject a marketer's message into an influencer's social media network.
Authentic Voice. We encourage honesty of opinion in the selection of sponsorships by a creator and similarly we encourage marketers to create opportunities that allow the creator to write the sponsorship in their own words, provided that a creator always adheres to our terms of service and code of ethics which includes disclosing their sponsored relationships at all times while using any of the platforms.
Transparency of Identity. Our platforms are designed to be an open, safe environment for our marketers, creators, and users. We do not cloak the identities of marketers or creators. Both parties involved in a potential transaction can see each other's profiles and make informed decisions before engaging with each other.
Pre-Publication Marketer Review. Marketers may choose to review their sponsored content before it is published and to request a change to the sponsored content before publication in the case of factual inaccuracies.
Reporting Violations. We have zero tolerance for violations of our terms of service and encourage the reporting of violations directly to IZEA. If violations are reported, we promptly investigate them and in appropriate cases, marketers, creators, and users are removed from our network and prohibited from using our sites. 
We believe and have included requirements within our terms of service, based on positions taken by certain federal courts and the FTC, that communications and messages disseminated by our platform users are subject to and must comply at all times with CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) requirements.
To date, we have not been materially impacted by the rules governing messaging over social media networks and social sponsorship, including the CAN-SPAM Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. However, we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on us and marketers and creators who use our platforms, nor can we predict the effects of attempts to circumvent our mechanisms designed to ensure compliance.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 131 employees, of which 125 were full-time employees, including 44 in sales and marketing, 38 in campaign fulfillment, 33 in technology and development, and 16 in administration and finance. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers, sales and marketing, account management, and senior management personnel.
