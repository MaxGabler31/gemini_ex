Item 1. | Business.

Description of the Business. Moog is a worldwide designer, manufacturer and systems integrator of high performance precision motion and fluid controls and controls systems for a broad range of applications in aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We have three operating segments: Aircraft Controls, Space and Defense Controls and Industrial Systems.
Additional information describing the business and comparative segment revenues, operating profits and related financial information for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are provided in Note 19 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Distribution. Our sales and marketing organization consists of individuals possessing highly specialized technical expertise. This expertise is required in order to effectively evaluate a customer’s precision control requirements and to facilitate communication between the customer and our engineering staff. Our sales staff is the primary contact with customers. Manufacturers’ representatives are used to cover certain domestic aerospace markets. Distributors are used selectively to cover certain industrial and medical markets.
Industry and Competitive Conditions. We experience considerable competition in our aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, reliability, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, timeliness of delivery, effectiveness of the distribution organization and quality of support after the sale. We believe we compete effectively on all of these bases. Competitors in our three operating segments include:

• | Aircraft Controls: Curtiss-Wright, Liebherr, Nabtesco, Parker Hannifin, UTC and Woodward.


• | Space and Defense Controls: Airbus, ATA Engineering, Bradford Engineering, Chess Dynamics, Cobham, Curtiss-Wright, ESW, EOS, Fulcrum Concepts LLC, General Dynamics, Glenair, Honeywell, Kearfott, Kollmorgan, Kongsberg, LORD, Marotta, Mission Systems, RUAG, Rafael, PVP Advanced, SABCA, Sargent Aerospace & Defense, Schleifring, SEAKR, Silent Sentinel, SL Montevideo, SwRI, UTC, Vacco, Valcor, ValveTech and Woodward.


• | Industrial Systems: Atos, Allen-Bradley, Bosch Rexroth, Cardinal Health, Danaher, DEIF Wind Power, E2M Technologies, Eaton, ICU Medical, KEB, MTS Systems Corp., Parker Hannifin, Siemens, Smiths Medical and SSB Wind Systems.

Government Contracts. All U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government. In 2018, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented 33% of total sales and were primarily within our Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls segments.
Backlog. Our twelve-month backlog represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. As noted in Item 6, Selected Financial Data of this report, as of September 29, 2018, our twelve-month backlog was $1.5 billion, an increase of 22% compared to September 30, 2017. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for a discussion on the various business drivers and conditions contributing to the twelve-month backlog change.
Raw Materials. Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous suppliers. We believe the loss of any one supplier, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term.
Working Capital. See the discussion on operating cycle in Note 1 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Seasonality. Our business is generally not seasonal; however, certain products and systems, such as those in the energy market of our Industrial Systems segment, do experience seasonal variations in sales levels.
Patents. We maintain a patent portfolio of issued or pending patents and patent applications worldwide that generally includes the U.S., Europe, China, Japan and India. The portfolio includes patents that relate to electrohydraulic, electromechanical, electronics, hydraulics, components and methods of operation and manufacture as related to motion control and actuation systems. The portfolio also includes patents related to wind turbines, robotics, surveillance/security, vibration control and medical devices. We do not consider any one or more of these patents or patent applications to be material in relation to our business as a whole. The patent portfolio related to certain medical devices is significant to our position in this market as several of these products work exclusively together, and provide us future revenue opportunities.
Research Activities. Research and development activity has been, and continues to be, significant for us. Research and development expense was at least $130 million in each of the last three years and represented approximately 5% of sales in 2018.
Employees. On September 29, 2018, we employed 11,787 full-time employees.
Customers. Our principal customers are Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and end users for whom we provide aftermarket support. Aerospace and defense OEM customers collectively represented 53% of 2018 sales. The majority of these sales are to a small number of large companies. Due to the long-term nature of many of the programs, many of our relationships with aerospace and defense OEM customers are based on long-term agreements. Our industrial OEM sales, which represented 34% of 2018 sales, are to a wide range of global customers and are normally based on lead times of 90 days or less. We also provide aftermarket support, consisting of spare and replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, for all of our products. Our major aftermarket customers are the U.S. Government and commercial airlines. In 2018, aftermarket sales accounted for 13% of total sales.
Significant customers in our three operating segments include:

• | Aircraft Controls: Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Japan Aerospace, General Dynamics, United Technologies, Honeywell, Bombardier, Embraer and the U.S. Government.


• | Space and Defense Controls: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, General Dynamics, Aerojet Rocketdyne, United Launch Alliance, Rockwell Collins, Airbus, Honeywell and the U.S. Government.


• | Industrial Systems: McKesson, Phillips Healthcare, CAE, Nutricia, Integrated Medical Systems,TurboChef Technologies, Oceaneering, MacArtney, Flight Safety and Arburg.
