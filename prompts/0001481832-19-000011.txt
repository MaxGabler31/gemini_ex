Item 1. | Business

Development of the Company
Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. was formed as a Maryland corporation on September 18, 2009 and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, effective with its tax year ended December 31, 2011. The Company was formed primarily to own and operate multifamily properties and, to a lesser extent, own and operate student housing properties, grocery anchored shopping centers and strategically located, well leased class A office buildings, all in select targeted markets throughout the United States. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into forward purchase contracts or purchase options for to-be-built multifamily communities and we may make real estate related loans, provide deposit arrangements, or provide performance assurances, as may be necessary or appropriate, in connection with the development of multifamily communities.  As a secondary strategy, we may acquire or originate senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in multifamily properties, membership or partnership interests in multifamily properties and other multifamily related assets and invest a portion of our assets in other real estate related investments, including other income-producing property types, senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in other income-producing property types, membership or partnership interests in other income-producing property types as determined by our manager as appropriate for us.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The Company controls the Operating Partnership through its sole general partnership interest and has and plans to continue to conduct substantially all its business through the Operating Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company held an approximate 97.5% weighted average ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership. 
Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Management Agreement, which was effective January 1, 2016, we replaced the acquisition fee owed to the Manager in connection with acquiring real property with a loan coordination fee that was payable in relation to the amount of new debt financed or outstanding debt assumed secured directly by any of our owned real estate asset or the additional amount of any supplemental financing secured directly any of our owned real estate assets. In addition, the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Management Agreement changes the name of the fee paid on loans originated by the Company from an "acquisition fee" to a "loan coordination fee."
As of July 1, 2017, the Manager reduced the loan coordination fee from 1.6% to 0.6% of the amount of assumed, new incremental or refinanced debt which leverages acquired real estate assets. In addition, the Manager reinstated a 1% acquisition fee charged on the cost of acquired real estate assets, which had historically been charged prior to its replacement effective January 1, 2016 by the 1.6% loan coordination fee. These changes were put in place to reflect a shift in the efforts of the Manager in property acquisitions.
As referred to herein, the Sixth Amended and Restated Management Agreement, as it may be amended, effective as of June 3, 2016, among the Company, our Operating Partnership and our Manager is referred to as the Management Agreement. We have no employees of our own; our Manager provides all managerial and administrative personnel to us pursuant to the Management Agreement. We also pay asset management fees, general and administrative expense fees, property management fees, construction management fees, leasing fees related to the management of our real estate portfolio (which may be waived solely at our discretion and recognized at a later date upon certain conditions), and disposition fees on the sale of a real estate asset. In addition, our Manager has no obligation to provide our board of directors with prior notice of a proposed investment transaction, but leaves intact our Manager’s obligation to notify the board of directors within 30 days following completion of an investment transaction. 
Both our Manager and our Operating Partnership are related parties to us.

(1) We evaluate each project individually and we make no assurance that we will acquire any of the underlying properties from our real estate loan investment portfolio. 
(2) The Company has terminated various purchase option agreements in exchange for termination fees. These properties are excluded from the potential additions from our real estate loan investment portfolio. 

We completed our initial public offering, or the IPO, on April 5, 2011. Our common stock, par value $.01 per share, or our Common Stock, is traded on the NYSE exchange under the symbol "APTS."
Investment Strategy
We seek to maximize returns for our stockholders by employing efficient management techniques to grow income and create asset value. Our investment strategies may include, without limitation, the following: 

• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets in performing and stable markets throughout the United States; these properties, we believe, will generate sustainable and growing cash flow from operations sufficient to allow us to cover the dividends that we expect to declare and pay and which we believe will have the potential for capital appreciation. These multifamily assets will generally be located in metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, with at least one million people which we expect will generate job growth and where we believe new multifamily development of comparable properties is able to be absorbed at attractive rental rates.


• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets that are intended to be financed with longer-term, assumable, fixed-rate debt typically provided by FHA/HUD programs.


• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets that present an opportunity to implement a value-add program whereby the properties can be upgraded or improved physically to better take advantage of the market.


• | Acquiring grocery-anchored shopping centers, typically anchored by one of the market-dominant grocers in that particular market.


• | Acquiring leading Class “A” office properties in high-growth markets across the U.S.


• | Acquiring Class “A” student housing properties at major universities around the United States. These assets will be located proximate to campuses with demonstrated track records of occupancy and rental rates. The universities served by these assets should generally be larger institutions with stated policies of increased enrollment and market trends that indicate new development is being or should be absorbed at attractive rental rates.

• | Originating real estate investment loans secured by interests in multifamily communities, membership or partnership interests in multifamily communities, other multifamily related assets, student housing properties, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties.


• | It is our policy to acquire any of our target assets primarily for income, and only secondarily for possible capital gain. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into forward purchase contracts or purchase options for to-be-built multifamily communities and we may make real estate related loans, provide deposit arrangements, or provide performance assurances, as may be necessary or appropriate, in connection with the construction of multifamily communities and other properties. 


• | We also may invest in real estate related debt, including, but not limited to, newly or previously originated first mortgage loans on multifamily properties that meet our investment criteria, which are performing or non-performing, newly or previously originated real estate related loans on multifamily properties that meet our investment criteria (second or subsequent mortgages), which are performing or non-performing, and tranches of securitized loans (pools of collateralized mortgaged-backed securities) on multifamily properties that meet our investment criteria, which are performing or non-performing. In connection with our investments in real estate related debt, we may negotiate the inclusion of exclusive purchase options on the to-be-developed properties. These purchase options may include a fixed purchase price set at the time we enter into the loan, or a purchase price which is calculated as a certain discount from market capitalization rates at the date of exercise of such purchase option. Certain of the purchase options we hold may be settled by cash payments to us in the event we elect not to acquire the underlying property.

Any asset acquisitions from affiliated third parties have been, and will continue to be, subject to approval by our conflicts committee comprised solely of independent directors. Our Manager's investment committee will periodically review our investment portfolio and its compliance with our investment guidelines and policies, and provide our board of directors an investment report at the end of each quarter in conjunction with its review of our quarterly results. Our investment guidelines, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to utilize leverage, and the appropriate levels of leverage are periodically reviewed by our board of directors as part of their oversight of our Manager. Our board of directors may amend or revise our investment guidelines without a vote of the stockholders. 
Financing Strategy
We intend to finance the acquisition of investments using various sources of capital, as described in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Included in this discussion are details regarding (i) our offering of $1.5 billion Units, consisting of one share of series A redeemable preferred stock, or Series A Preferred Stock, and one warrant exercisable into 20 shares of Common Stock, or Series A Units, (ii) our offering of up to $150 million of Common Stock pursuant to our "at the market" offering, or the 2016 ATM Offering, which commenced with the first settlement in August 2016, and (iii) our offering of 500,000 shares of our series m preferred stock, or mShares, pursuant to our mShares Offering. Our mShares Offering was declared effective on December 2, 2016 and our offering of 1,500,000 Series A Units, or our $1.5 Billion Unit Offering, was declared effective on February 14, 2017. The Series A Preferred Stock and our mShares are collectively referred to as our Preferred Stock.
We intend to utilize leverage in making our investments. The number of different investments we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including the amount of funds available to us. By operating on a leveraged basis, we will have more funds available for our investments. This will allow us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a larger and more diversified portfolio. See the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the risks related to operating on a leveraged basis. 
We generally intend to target leverage levels (secured and unsecured) between 50% and 65% of the fair market value of our tangible assets (including our real estate assets, real estate loans, notes receivable, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents) on a portfolio basis. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding debt (both secured and unsecured) was approximately 52.4% of the value of our tangible assets on a portfolio basis based on our estimates of fair market value at December 31, 2018. Neither our charter nor our by-laws contain any limitation on the amount of leverage we may use. Our investment guidelines, which can be amended by our board without stockholder approval, limit our borrowings (secured and unsecured) to 75% of the cost of our tangible assets at the time of any new borrowing. These targets, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. The amount of leverage we will place on particular investments will depend on our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in the portfolio, the availability and cost of financing the asset, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and the health of the commercial real estate market in general. In addition, factors such as our outlook on interest rates, changes in the yield curve slope, the level and volatility of 
3

interest rates and their associated credit spreads, the underlying collateral of our assets and our outlook on credit spreads relative to our outlook on interest rate and economic performance could all impact our decision and strategy for financing the target assets. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the investment cost for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value. However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. Finally, we intend to acquire all our properties through separate single purpose entities and intend to finance each of these properties using debt financing techniques for that property alone, without any cross-collateralization to our other properties or any guarantees by us or our Operating Partnership. We have an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or Credit Facility, with Key Bank, N.A., or Key Bank. The Credit Facility provides for our $200.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Line of Credit. Other than with regard to our Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2018, we held no debt at the Company or operating partnership levels, had no cross-collateralization of our real estate mortgages, and had no contingent liabilities at the Company or operating partnership levels with regard to our secured mortgage debt on our properties. 
Leverage may be obtained from a variety of sources, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), commercial banks, credit companies, the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), a unit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), insurance companies, pension funds, endowments, financial services companies and other institutions who wish to provide debt financing for our assets. 
Our secured and unsecured aggregate borrowings are intended by us to be reasonable in relation to our net assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. In determining whether our borrowings are reasonable in relation to our net assets, we expect that our board of directors will consider many factors, including the lending standards of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other companies for loans in connection with the financing of multifamily properties, the leverage ratios of publicly traded and non-traded REITs with similar investment strategies, whether we have positive leverage (in that, the board of directors will compare the capitalization rates of our properties to the interest rates on the indebtedness of such properties) and general market and economic conditions. There is no limitation on the amount that we may borrow for any single investment or the number of mortgages that may be placed on any one property.
Branding Strategy
Our Manager has branded, and intends to brand, all apartment communities owned by us as “A Preferred Apartment Community” which we believe signifies outstanding brand and management standards, and has obtained all rights to the trademarks, including federal registration of the trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, to secure such brand in connection with such branding. We believe these campaigns will enhance each individual property's presence in relation to other properties within that marketplace.
On September 17, 2010, we entered into a trademark license and assignment agreement pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free license of all our trademarks to our Manager and agreed to assign all of our trademarks to our Manager upon the applications related to our trademarks being successfully converted to use based applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Pursuant to this agreement, in March 2012, we assigned these trademarks to our Manager and concurrently entered into a royalty-free license agreement for these trademarks with us as licensee. Similarly, in March 2012, our Manager entered into a royalty-free license agreement with us as licensee with respect to all other intellectual property of the Manager. The license agreements will terminate automatically upon termination of the Management Agreement, or upon a material breach of a license agreement that remains uncured for more than 30 days after receipt of notice of such breach. Following such termination, we will be required to enter into a new arrangement with our Manager in order to continue our rights to use our Manager's intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on terms acceptable to us. 
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to regulation at the federal, state and municipal levels and are at risk for potential liability should conditions at our properties or our actions or inaction result in damage to the environment or to persons or properties. These conditions could include the potential presence or growth of mold, potential leaks from current or former underground or above-ground storage tanks, breakage or leaks from sewer lines and risks pertaining to the management or disposal of wastes and chemicals. We could be liable for the potential costs of compliance, property damage, restoration and other costs which could occur without regard to our fault or knowledge of such conditions. 
In the course of acquiring and owning real estate assets, we typically engage an independent environmental consulting firm to perform a phase I environmental assessment (and if appropriate, a phase II assessment) to identify and mitigate these risks as part of our due diligence process. We believe these assessment reports provide a reasonable basis for discovery of potential adverse environmental conditions prior to acquisition. If any potential environmental risks or conditions are discovered during 
4

our due diligence process, the potential costs of remediation are assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition, assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and reasonable. Some risks or conditions may be identified that are significant enough to cause us to abandon the possibility of acquiring a given property. As of December 31, 2018, we have no knowledge of any material claims made or pending against us with regard to environmental matters for which we could be found liable, nor are we aware of any potential hazards to the environment related to any of our properties which could reasonably be expected to result in a material loss.
Competition
The multifamily housing industry is highly fragmented and we compete for residents with a large number of other quality apartment communities in our target markets which are owned by public and private companies, including other REITs, many of which are larger and have more resources than our Company. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect our ability to lease our multifamily communities, as well as the rents we are able to charge. In addition, other forms of residential properties, including single family housing and town homes, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities. The factors on which we focus to compete for residents in our multifamily communities include our high level of resident service, the quality of our apartment communities (including our landscaping and amenity offerings), and the desirability of our locations. Resident leases at our apartment communities are priced competitively based on levels of supply and demand within our target markets and we believe our communities offer a compelling value to prospective residents. 
Similarly, competition for tenants and acquisition of existing centers in the grocery-anchored shopping center sector in our target markets is considerable, consisting of public and private companies, pension funds, high net worth individuals and family offices. In addition, a significant competitor in this sector are some of the grocery anchors themselves as they acquire land and build their own stores or acquire the entire center where they are the anchor. We are faced with the challenge of maintaining high occupancy rates with a financially stable tenant base. In order to attract quality prospective tenants and retain current tenants upon expiration of their leases, we focus on improving the design and visibility of our centers, building strong relationships with our tenants, and reducing excess operating costs and increasing tenant satisfaction through proactive asset and property management. We target acquisitions in markets with solid surrounding demographics, quality underlying real estate locations, and centers where our asset management approach can provide an environment conducive to creating sales productivity for our tenants.
We compete with other primarily institutional-quality owners and investors in the business of acquiring, investing to develop, leasing and operating office properties. We leverage relationships, track record, and the high quality of our physical assets and locations to compete successfully. Additional principal factors of competition are the leasing terms (including rental rates and concessions or allowances offered) and the terms of any other investment activity such as real estate loan investments in new development. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
