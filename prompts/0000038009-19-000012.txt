ITEM 1. Business.
Overview
Ford Motor Credit Company LLC was incorporated in Delaware in 1959 and converted to a limited liability company in 2007. We are an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company (“Ford”). Our principal executive offices are located at One American Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48126, and our telephone number is (313) 322-3000.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge through our website located at www.fordcredit.com/investor-center.  These reports can also be found on the SEC’s website located at www.sec.gov. 
Our website and its content are not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“2018 Form 10-K Report” or “Report”) nor filed with the SEC.
Products and Services. We offer a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world. The predominant share of our business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and supporting the dealers of those brands. We earn our revenue primarily from: 

• | Payments made under retail installment sale and lease contracts that we originate and purchase;


• | Interest rate supplements and other support payments from Ford and affiliated companies; and


• | Payments made under dealer financing programs.

As a result of our financing activities, we have a large portfolio of consumer and non-consumer finance receivables and operating leases.
Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of Ford and Lincoln vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and direct financing leases for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.
Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers and receivables related to Ford and its affiliates. We make wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs. We also purchase receivables from Ford and its affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. In addition, we provide financing to Ford for vehicles that Ford leases to its employees. 
We also service the finance receivables and leases we originate and purchase, make loans to Ford affiliates, and provide insurance services related to our financing programs.
Geographic Scope of Operations and Segment Information. We conduct our financing operations directly and indirectly through our subsidiaries and affiliates. We offer substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, subject to local legal restrictions and market conditions. We segment our business based on geographic regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Items excluded in assessing segment performance because they are managed at the corporate level, including market valuation adjustments to derivatives and exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions, are reflected in Unallocated Other. 
For additional financial information regarding our operations by business segment and operations by geographic region, see Note 17 of our Notes to the Financial Statements.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

Americas Segment 
Our Americas segment includes operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. This segment represented 78% and 80% of total managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our United States operations accounted for 85% and 87% of Americas segment total managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively, and our Canadian operations accounted for 13% and 12% of Americas segment total managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. Managed receivables equal net finance receivables and net investment in operating leases, excluding unearned interest supplements and residual support, allowance for credit losses, and other (primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation). For additional information on how we review our business performance, including on a managed basis, refer to the “Overview” section of Item 7. Managed receivables are discussed further in the “Financial Condition” section of Item 7. 
Under the Ford Credit and Lincoln Automotive Financial Services brand names, we provide financing services to and through dealers of Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Operations in some markets may also include joint ventures with local financial institutions and other third parties. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets.
Europe Segment 
Our Europe segment includes operations in the European region and a joint venture in South Africa. This segment represented 17% of total managed receivables at both year-end 2017 and 2018. Our operations in the European region are managed primarily through a United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (“FCE”), which operates in the United Kingdom and has branches in 11 other European countries. On July 1, 2018, FCE established an operating subsidiary in Germany, Ford Bank GmbH (“Ford Bank”). FCE also has operating subsidiaries in Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary that provide a variety of retail and dealer financing. The United Kingdom and Germany are our largest markets in Europe, representing 59% and 58% of Europe segment managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. Customers and dealers in Italy, France, and Spain were 23% and 24% of Europe segment managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. FCE, through its Worldwide Trade Financing (“WWTF”) division, provides financing to distributors and importers in about 70 countries where Ford has no national sales company presence. Our operations include joint ventures with local financial institutions and other third parties in various locations. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets.
Asia Pacific Segment 
Our Asia Pacific segment includes operations in China and India. This segment represented 5% and 3% of total managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. China operations accounted for 97% and 96% of Asia Pacific segment total managed receivables at year-end 2017 and 2018, respectively. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets.
Dependence on Ford
The predominant share of our business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and supporting Ford and Lincoln dealers. Any extended reduction or suspension of Ford’s production or sale of vehicles due to a decline in consumer demand, work stoppage, governmental action, negative publicity or other event, or significant changes to marketing programs sponsored by Ford would have an adverse effect on our business. Additional information about Ford’s business, operations, production, sales, and risks can be found in Ford’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“Ford’s 2018 Form 10-K Report”), filed separately with the SEC. 
Ford has sponsored special financing programs available only through us. Under these programs, Ford makes interest supplements or other support payments to us. These programs increase our financing volume and share of financing sales and operating leases of Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Similar programs may be offered in the future. For additional information regarding interest supplements and other support costs received from affiliated companies, see Notes 4 and 5 of our Notes to the Financial Statements.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

Competition 
The automotive financing business is highly competitive, due in part to web-based credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send, through standardized systems, retail credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these finance sources. Our principal competitors are:

• | Banks;


• | Independent finance companies;


• | Credit unions;


• | Leasing companies; and


• | Other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies.

We compete mainly on the basis of service and financing rate programs, including those sponsored by Ford. A key foundation of our service is providing broad and consistent purchasing policies for retail installment sale and lease contracts, and consistent support for dealer financing requirements across economic cycles. These policies have helped us build strong relationships with Ford’s dealer network that enhance our competitiveness. Our ability to provide competitive financing rates depends on effectively and efficiently originating, purchasing, and servicing our receivables, and efficiently accessing the capital markets. We routinely monitor the capital markets and develop funding plans to optimize our competitive position. Ford-sponsored special financing programs available only through us give us a competitive advantage in providing financing to Ford dealers and their customers.
Seasonal Variations 
As a finance company, we own and manage a large portfolio of receivables that are generated throughout the year and are collected over a number of years, primarily in fixed monthly payments. As a result, our overall financing revenues do not exhibit seasonal variations.
Consumer Financing
Overview and Purchasing Process
We provide financing services to customers for personal and commercial use through automotive dealers that have established relationships with us. Our primary business consists of originating and purchasing retail installment sale and lease contracts for new and used vehicles from Ford and Lincoln dealers. We report in our financial statements the receivables from customers under installment sale contracts and certain leases with fleet customers as finance receivables. We report in our financial statements most of our retail leases as net investment in operating leases with the capitalized cost of the vehicles recorded as depreciable assets.
In general, we purchase from dealers retail installment sale contracts and lease contracts that meet our purchase standards. These contracts primarily relate to the purchase or lease of new vehicles, but some are for used vehicles. Dealers typically submit customer applications electronically. We automatically obtain information on the applicant including a credit bureau score, if available. We use a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality using information in the credit application, proposed contract terms, credit bureau data, and other information. After a proprietary risk score is generated, we decide whether to purchase a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations. Purchase decisions are made within a framework of Ford Credit’s purchase quality and risk factor guidelines. Credit applications are typically evaluated by our electronic decisioning process, which may approve or reject applications. 
Retail Financing
The amount we pay for a retail installment sale contract is based on a negotiated vehicle purchase price agreed to between the dealer and the retail customer, less vehicle trade-in allowance or down payment from the customer and special marketing cash payments offered by Ford Credit and Ford, plus any additional products, such as insurance and extended service plans, that are included in the contract. The net purchase price owed by the customer typically is paid over a specified number of months with interest at a fixed rate negotiated between the dealer and the retail customer. The dealer may retain a limited portion of the finance charge.
3

Item 1. Business (Continued)

We offer a variety of retail installment sale financing products. The average original term of our retail installment sale contracts in the United States was 65 months for contracts purchased in both 2017 and 2018. A small portion of our retail installment sale contracts have non-uniform payment periods and payment amounts to accommodate special cash flow situations. We also offer a retail balloon product in Europe under which the retail customer may finance a vehicle with an installment sale contract with a series of monthly payments followed by paying the amount remaining in a single balloon payment. The customer can satisfy the balloon payment obligation by payment in full of the amount owed, by refinancing the amount owed, or by returning the vehicle to us and paying any contractually agreed additional charges for excess mileage or excess wear and use. Generally, we sell vehicles returned to us to Ford dealers and non-Ford dealers through auctions. 
In most markets, we hold a security interest in the vehicles purchased through retail installment sale contracts. This security interest provides us certain rights and protections. As a result, if our collection efforts fail to bring a delinquent customer’s payments current, we generally can repossess the customer’s vehicle, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it at auction. The customer typically remains liable for any deficiency between net auction proceeds and the defaulted contract obligations, including any repossession-related expenses. We generally require retail customers to carry fire, theft, and collision insurance on financed vehicles.
We offer vehicle-financing programs to retail and commercial customers including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers. These financings include primarily lease plans for terms of 24 to 60 months. We hold a security interest in financed vehicles in almost all instances.  At the end of the finance term, a lease customer may be required to pay any shortfall between the fair market value and the specified end of term value of the vehicle. If the fair market value of the vehicle at the end of the finance term exceeds the specified end of term value, the lease customer may be paid the excess amount. These financings are included in our consumer segment and reported as retail financing.
Net Investment in Operating Leases
We offer leasing plans to retail customers through our dealers. Our highest volume retail-leasing plan is called Red Carpet Lease, which is offered in the United States and Canada through dealers of Ford and Lincoln brands. Under these plans, dealers originate the leases and offer them to us for purchase. Upon our purchase of a lease, we take ownership of the lease and title to the leased vehicle from the dealer. After we purchase a lease from a dealer, the dealer generally has no further obligation to us in connection with the lease. The customer is responsible for properly maintaining the vehicle and is obligated to pay for excess wear and use as well as excess mileage, if any. At the end of the lease, the customer has the option to purchase the vehicle for the price specified in the lease contract, or return the vehicle to the dealer. If the customer returns the vehicle to the dealer, the dealer may buy the vehicle from us or return it to us. We generally sell vehicles returned to us to Ford and non-Ford dealers through auctions.
The amount we pay to a dealer for a retail lease, also called the acquisition cost, is based on the negotiated vehicle price agreed to between the dealer and the retail customer, less any vehicle trade-in allowance or down payment from the customer and special marketing cash payments offered by Ford Credit and Ford, plus any additional products, such as insurance and extended service plans, that are included in the contract. The customer makes monthly lease payments based on the purchase price less the contractual residual value of the vehicle, plus lease charges. Some of our lease programs, such as our Red Carpet Lease Advance Payment Plan, provide certain pricing advantages to customers who make all or some monthly payments at lease inception or purchase refundable higher mileage allowances. We require lease customers to carry fire, theft, liability, and collision insurance on leased vehicles. In the case of a contract default and repossession, the customer typically remains liable for any deficiency between net auction proceeds and the defaulted contract obligations, including any repossession-related expenses.
In the United States, operating lease terms for new vehicles range primarily from 24 to 39 months. In both 2017 and 2018, the average original lease term for contracts purchased was 35 months.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

Non-Consumer Financing 
Overview
We extend credit to franchised dealers selling Ford and Lincoln vehicles primarily in the form of approved lines of credit to purchase new and used vehicles. Each lending request is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition, supporting security, and numerous other financial and qualitative factors. Generally, receivables are secured by the related vehicle or the related property and may also be secured by other dealer assets. Asset verification processes are in place and include physical audits of vehicle inventories with increased audit frequency for higher-risk dealers.
Dealer Financing 
Wholesale Financing. We offer a wholesale financing program for qualifying dealers to finance new and used vehicles held in inventory (also known as floorplan financing). We generally finance the vehicle’s wholesale invoice price for new vehicles and up to 100% of the dealer’s purchase price for used vehicles. Dealers generally pay a floating interest rate on wholesale loans. In the United States, the average new wholesale receivable, excluding the time the vehicle was in transit from the assembly plant to the dealership, was outstanding for 71 days in 2017 compared with 68 days in 2018. Our wholesale financing program includes financing of large multi-brand dealer groups. 
When a dealer uses our wholesale financing program to purchase vehicles, we obtain a security interest in the vehicles and, in many instances, other assets of the dealer. In the United States and Canada, our wholly owned subsidiary, The American Road Insurance Company (“TARIC”), generally provides insurance for vehicle damage and theft of vehicles held in dealer inventory that are financed by us.
Dealer Loans. We make loans to dealers to finance the purchase of dealership real estate, to make improvements to dealership facilities, and to provide working capital. These loans are typically secured by mortgages on dealership real estate and/or by security interests in other dealership assets. In addition, these loans are generally supported by personal guarantees from the individual owners of the dealership. 
Other Dealer Financing. We also provide financing to qualified dealers for vehicles to be utilized for service replacement and retail rental use. In addition, we provide financing to qualified daily rental companies for new and used vehicles used in their operations.
Other Financing
We also purchase receivables from Ford and its affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. In addition, we provide financing to Ford for vehicles that Ford leases to its employees. These receivables are excluded from our credit quality reporting since the performance of this group of receivables is generally guaranteed by Ford. 
Marketing and Special Programs 
We actively market our financing products and services to automotive dealers and customers. We demonstrate to dealers the value of a business relationship with us through personal sales contacts, targeted advertisements in trade publications, and participation in dealer-focused conventions and organizations. Our marketing strategy is based on our belief that we can better assist dealers in achieving their sales, financial, and customer satisfaction goals by being a reliable finance source with knowledgeable automotive and financial professionals offering personal attention and interaction. We demonstrate our commitment to dealer relationships with a variety of materials, measurements, and analyses showing the advantages of a full range of automotive financing products that allows consistent and predictable single source financing. We promote increased dealer transactions through incentives, bonuses, contests, and selected program and rate adjustments.
5

Item 1. Business (Continued)

We promote our retail financing products primarily through pre-approved credit offers to prospective customers, point-of-sale information, and ongoing communications with existing customers. Our communications to these customers promote the advantages of our financing products, the availability of special plans and programs, and the benefits of affiliated products, such as extended warranties, service plans, insurance coverage, gap protection, and excess wear and use waivers. We also emphasize the quality of our customer service and the ease of making payments and transacting business with us. For example, through our web site located at www.fordcredit.com or via our mobile application a customer can make inquiries, review an account balance, examine current incentives, schedule an electronic payment, or qualify for a pre-approved credit offer.
We also market our non-consumer financing services with a specialized group of employees who make direct sales calls on dealers and, often at the request of such dealers, on potential high-volume commercial customers. This group also uses various materials to explain our flexible programs and services specifically directed at the needs of commercial and fleet vehicle customers.
Servicing
Consumer Financing
After we purchase retail installment sale contracts and leases from dealers and other customers, we manage the contracts during their contract terms. This management process is called servicing. We service the finance receivables and leases we originate and purchase. Our servicing duties include the following:

• | Applying monthly payments from customers;


• | Maintaining a security interest in the financed vehicle;


• | Providing billing statements to customers;


• | Responding to customer inquiries;


• | Releasing our security interest on paid-off finance contracts;


• | Contacting delinquent customers for payment;


• | Arranging for the repossession of vehicles; and


• | Selling repossessed and returned vehicles.

Customer Payment Operations. Customers may make payments by mailing checks to a bank for deposit in a lockbox account, through electronic payment services, a direct debit program, or a telephonic payment system.
Collections. We design our collection strategies and procedures to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. We employ a combination of proprietary and non-proprietary tools to assess the probability and severity of default for all of our finance receivables and leases and implement our collection efforts based on our determination of the credit risk associated with each customer. As each customer develops a payment history, we use an internally developed behavioral scoring model to assist in determining the best collection strategies. Based on data from this scoring model, contracts are categorized by collection risk. Our centralized collection operations are supported by auto-dialing technology and proprietary collection and workflow operating systems. Through our auto-dialer program and our monitoring and call log systems, we target our efforts on contacting customers about missed payments and developing satisfactory solutions to bring accounts current.
Supplier Operations. We engage vendors to perform some of our servicing processes. These processes include depositing monthly payments from customers, monitoring the perfection of security interests in financed vehicles, imaging of contracts and electronic data file maintenance, generating retail and lease billing statements, providing telephonic payment systems for retail customers, handling of some inbound and outbound collections calls, and recovering deficiencies for selected accounts. 
Payment Extensions. In our regular course of business we may offer payment extensions to customers. Each month 1% to 2% of our U.S. retail contracts outstanding are granted payment extensions. A payment extension allows the customer to extend the term of the contract, usually by paying a fee that is calculated in a manner specified by law. Before agreeing to a payment extension, the service representative reviews the customer’s payment history and current financial situation and assesses the customer’s desire and capacity to make future payments. The service representative decides whether the proposed payment extension complies with our policies and guidelines. Payment extensions are reviewed regularly by Ford Credit’s servicing managers.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

Repossessions and Off-lease Vehicles. We view repossession of a financed or leased vehicle as a final step that we undertake only after all other collection efforts have failed. Our United States and Canada systems also employ a web-based network of outside contractors who support the repossession process. In all of our markets we sell repossessed vehicles and apply the proceeds to the amount owed on the customer’s account. We continue to attempt collection of any deficient amounts until the account is paid in full, we obtain mutually satisfactory payment arrangements with the debtor, or we determine that the account is uncollectible. Repossessed vehicles are reported in Other assets on our balance sheet at values that approximate expected net auction proceeds. 
We manage the sale of returned leased vehicles and repossessed vehicles. We inspect and recondition the vehicle to maximize the net auction value of the vehicle. Returned leased vehicles are predominantly sold through an on-line auction, closed auctions in which only Ford and Lincoln dealers may participate, or at open auctions in which any licensed dealer can participate. Typically, repossessed vehicles are sold at open auctions. 
Non-Consumer Financing
In the United States and Canada, we require dealers to submit monthly financial statements that we monitor for potential credit deterioration. We assign an evaluation rating to each dealer, which, among other things, determines the frequency of physical audits of vehicle inventory.  We electronically audit vehicle inventory utilizing integrated systems allowing us to access information from Ford reported sales. We monitor dealer inventory financing payoffs daily to detect deviations from typical repayment patterns and take appropriate actions. If a dealer fails to make principal or interest payments when due, we will classify the dealer as “status” and may take one or more of the following actions: demand payment of all or a portion of the related receivables; suspend the dealer’s credit lines; place Ford Credit employees or security personnel at the dealership; secure the dealer’s inventory; require certified funds for all vehicles sold by the dealer; initiate legal actions to exercise rights under the floorplan financing agreement; or increase the dealer’s floorplan interest rate. If a loss appears imminent, we will attempt to redistribute new vehicle inventory, liquidate all remaining collateral, enforce any third-party guarantees, and charge off any remaining amounts as uncollectible. 
We also provide financing to fleet purchasers, leasing companies, daily rental companies, and other commercial customers. We generally review our exposure under these credit arrangements at least annually.
Outside of the United States and Canada, non-consumer financing is managed by the respective regional offices, executed within the local markets, and similar risk management principles are applied. 
Insurance 
We conduct insurance underwriting operations primarily through TARIC in the United States and Canada. TARIC offers a variety of products and services, including:

• | Physical damage insurance coverage for Ford Credit financed vehicles at dealer locations;


• | Physical damage insurance coverage for Ford and Lincoln vehicles in transit between final assembly plants and dealer locations;


• | Contractual liability insurance on extended service contracts for Ford and its affiliates; and


• | Commercial automobile and general liability insurance and surety bonds for Ford in the United States.

TARIC invests premiums and other revenue to fund future claims, and has established investment guidelines and strategies to reflect its risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors. TARIC is rated by A.M. Best Company on its financial strength and issuer credit rating. Since 2012, TARIC’s rating has been A (Excellent) for its financial strength and “a” on its issuer credit rating.
We also offer various Ford-branded insurance products throughout the world underwritten by non-affiliated insurance companies from which we receive fee income but the underwriting risk remains with the non-affiliated insurance companies. Premiums from our insurance business generated 1% of our total revenues in both 2017 and 2018.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

Employee Relations 
We employed approximately 7,600 full-time employees worldwide at both year-end 2017 and 2018. Most employees are salaried and are not represented by a union. We consider employee relations to be satisfactory.
Governmental Regulations
As a finance company, we are highly regulated by the governmental authorities in the locations where we operate.
United States
Within the United States, our operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws.
Federal Regulation. We are subject to federal regulation, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective purchasers and lessees in consumer retail and lease financing transactions and prohibit discriminatory credit practices. The principal disclosures required under the Truth-in-Lending Act for retail financing transactions include the terms of repayment, the amount financed, the total finance charge, and the annual percentage rate. For retail lease transactions, under the Consumer Leasing Act, we are required to disclose the amount due at lease inception, the terms for payment, and information about lease charges, insurance, excess mileage, wear and use charges, and liability on early termination. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants and customers on a variety of factors, including race, color, sex, age, or marital status. Pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for being denied. In addition, any of the credit scoring systems we use during the application process or other processes must comply with the requirements for such systems under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a consumer credit report obtained from a national credit bureau and sets forth requirements related to identity theft, privacy, and accuracy in credit reporting. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), it is unlawful for us to engage in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice. We are also subject to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act that provides additional protections for certain customers in the military such as prohibiting us from charging interest in excess of 6% on transactions with those customers, limiting our ability to collect future payments from those lease customers who terminate their lease early, and limiting our use of self-help repossession of the vehicle for those customers. We are subject to other federal regulation, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, that requires us to maintain confidentiality and safeguard certain consumer data in our possession and to communicate periodically with consumers on privacy matters. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s financing business. For additional discussion of the CFPB, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
We are also subject to regulation in our funding and securitization activities, including requirements under federal securities laws and specific rules and requirements for asset-backed securities. Derivative activities are regulated under the Commodities Exchange Act and Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations also impose operational and reporting requirements for these funding transactions. 
State Regulation - Licensing. In most states, a consumer credit regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to finance companies. Rules and regulations generally provide for licensing of finance companies, limitations on the amount, duration, and charges, including interest rates, that can be included in finance contracts, requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation, and restrictions on collection practices and creditors’ rights. We must renew these licenses periodically. In periods of high interest rates, rate limitations could have an adverse effect on our operations if we were unable to purchase retail installment sale contracts with finance charges that reflect our increased costs. In certain states, we are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

State Regulation - Repossessions. To mitigate our credit losses, sometimes we repossess a financed or leased vehicle. Repossessions are subject to prescribed legal procedures, including peaceful repossession, one or more customer notifications, a prescribed waiting period prior to disposition of the repossessed vehicle, and return of personal items to the customer. Some states provide the customer with reinstatement rights that require us to return a repossessed vehicle to the customer in certain circumstances. Our ability to repossess and sell a repossessed vehicle is restricted if a customer declares bankruptcy.
International 
In some countries outside the United States, some of our subsidiaries, including FCE and Ford Bank, are regulated and/or licensed banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital and liquidity. FCE is authorized by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the PRA to carry on a range of regulated activities within the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, CRD IV, FCE operates through a branch and subsidiary network in 14 other European countries. Under FCE’s banking license, consumer credit and leasing activities are also passported to the European branches. In many other locations where we operate, governmental authorities require us to obtain equivalent banking licenses to conduct our business.
Regulatory Compliance Status
Based on our compliance management processes and procedures, we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us and our operations. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, reputation, and/or liquidity. Further, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or the revision of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and/or liquidity.
We actively monitor proposed changes to relevant legal and regulatory requirements in order to maintain our compliance. Through our governmental relations efforts, we also attempt to participate in the legislative and administrative rule-making process on regulatory initiatives that impact finance companies. The cost of our ongoing compliance efforts has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
For additional information on new or increased credit regulations, consumer or data protection regulations, or other regulations, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Certain Agreements with Ford and Affiliates
We and Ford are parties to an Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement (the “Relationship Agreement”) relating to our long-standing business practices with Ford. A copy of the Relationship Agreement was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 30, 2015, and is incorporated by reference herein as an exhibit. Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, if our managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 11.5 to 1 (as reported in our most recent Form 10-Q Report or Form 10-K Report), we can require Ford to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to us in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to have been 11.5 to 1. No capital contributions have been made to us pursuant to the Relationship Agreement. 
In addition to the foregoing, the other principal terms of the Relationship Agreement include the following:

• | Any extension of credit from us to Ford or any of Ford’s automotive affiliates will be on arm’s length terms and will be enforced by us in a commercially reasonable manner;


• | We will not guarantee more than $500 million of the indebtedness of, make any investments in, or purchase any real property or manufacturing equipment classified as an automotive asset from Ford or any of Ford’s automotive affiliates;


• | We will not be required by Ford or any of Ford’s automotive affiliates to accept credit or residual risk beyond what we would be willing to accept acting in a prudent and commercially reasonable manner (taking into consideration any interest rate supplements or residual value support payments, guarantees, or other subsidies that are provided to us by Ford or any of Ford’s automotive affiliates);


• | We and Ford are separate, legally distinct companies, and we will continue to maintain separate books and accounts. We will prevent our assets from being commingled with Ford’s assets, and hold ourselves out as a separate and distinct company from Ford and Ford’s automotive affiliates; 


• | Allocates to us $3.0 billion of commitments, including commitments under a Chinese renminbi sub-facility as the amount we may borrow as a Subsidiary Borrower under Ford’s corporate credit facility and requires us to reimburse Ford for a proportionate amount of Ford’s costs under that credit facility; and


• | Prohibits Ford from terminating Ford’s corporate credit facility prior to its maturity, or taking any other action that would impair our ability to borrow under that credit facility, without our prior written consent.

We also have an agreement to maintain FCE’s net worth in excess of $500 million. No payments have been made to FCE pursuant to the agreement during the 2001 through 2018 periods.
More information about agreements between us and Ford and other affiliates is contained in our Notes to the Financial Statements, “Business - Overview,” “Business - Consumer Financing - Retail Financing,” “Business - Non-Consumer Financing - Other Financing,” and the description of Ford’s business in Ford’s 2018 Form 10-K Report.
