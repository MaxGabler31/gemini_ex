ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History and Corporate Structure 
 
Moxian, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 12, 2010 and was formerly known as SECURE NetCheckIn Inc. in the business of offering a cloud-based scheduling and notification product for the medical industry. The Company changed its name to Moxian China, Inc. on December 13, 2013 and to Moxian, Inc. on July 19, 2015.
 
On February 17, 2014, the Company incorporated Moxian CN Samoa under the laws of Samoa. 
 
On February 21, 2014, the Company acquired Moxian BVI, together with its subsidiaries, Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen, and Moxian Malaysia through its wholly owned subsidiary, Moxian CN Samoa from Rebel Group, Inc. (“REBL”), a company incorporated in the State of Florida and of which our then Chief Executive Officer, James Mengdong Tan, was a promoter as the term is defined under Rule 405 of Regulation C promulgated under the Securities Act, by entering into a License and Acquisition Agreement (the “License and Acquisition Agreement”) in consideration of $1,000,000 (“Moxian BVI Purchase Price”).
 
As a result, Moxian BVI, together with its subsidiaries, Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen, and Moxian Malaysia, became our subsidiaries. Under the License and Acquisition Agreement, REBL also agreed to grant us the exclusive right to use REBL’s intellectual property rights (collectively, the “IP Rights”) in Mainland China, Malaysia, and other countries and regions where REBL conducts its business (the “Licensed Territory”), and the exclusive right to solicit, promote, distribute and sell REBL products and services in the Licensed Territory for five years (the “License,”) and in consideration of such License, the Company agreed to pay to REBL (i) $1,000,000 as license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License Agreement; and (ii) 3% of the gross profits resulting from the distribution and sale of the products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. 
 
Moxian BVI was incorporated on July 3, 2012 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. 
 
Moxian HK was incorporated on January 18, 2013 and became Moxian BVI’s subsidiary on February 14, 2013. 
 
Moxian Shenzhen was incorporated on April 8, 2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moxian HK and is engaged in the business of internet technology, computer software, and commercial information consulting. 
 
Moxian Malaysia was incorporated on March 1, 2013 and became Moxian HK’s subsidiary on April 2, 2013. 
 
Shenzhen Moyi Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Moyi”) was incorporated on July 19, 2013 under the laws of the People’s Republic of China. On July 15, 2014, Moxian Shenzhen entered into a series of agreements with Shenzhen Moyi Technologies Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of People’s Republic of China (“Moyi”), and its shareholders which permit us to operate Moyi and the right to purchase all of its equity interests from its shareholders as described below (the “Moyi Agreements”).
 
On December 18, 2017, the Company entered into a Tripartite Agreement with the original shareholders of Moyi and the new shareholders of Moyi wherein the Company agrees to the transfer o the equity interests of Moyi and all related rights, liabilities and obligations under the Moyi Agreements such that the new shareholders stand in place of the old shareholders in all aspects of the Moyi Agreements.
 
Moyi, which is owned solely by Chinese shareholders, is granted an Internet Content Provider license (“ICP License”). Businesses in China that are engaged in the business of Internet information services, including online advertisement and e-commerce services, are required to obtain an ICP License. Due to Chinese regulatory restrictions on foreign investments in the Internet sector, we operate our marketing platform and conduct our business through Moyi pursuant to the Moyi Agreements. Under the Moyi Agreements, Moyi will be treated as a variable interest entity in which the Company does not have direct or controlling equity interest but the historical financial results of such entity will be consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 
 
Due to the transfer of interests from the Original Moyi Shareholders to the New Moyi Shareholders, the Company’s Board of Directors determined that it was appropriate to terminate such Moyi Agreements as the original Moyi Agreements had executed and to execute substantially similar Moyi Agreements with the New Moyi Shareholders. Because the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement did not include the Original Moyi Shareholders as a party, it has not been terminated. The Share Pledge Agreement, Power of Attorney and Exclusive Option Agreement were officially terminated as to the Original Moyi Shareholders as of January 8, 2018 and new Share Pledge Agreement, Power of Attorney and Exclusive Option Agreement were entered into with the New Moyi Shareholders at the same date. The parties’ intent throughout has been to maintain control of Moyi by Shenzhen Moxian and, by extension, the Company.

Moxian Technologies (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Moxian Beijing”) was incorporated on December 10, 2015 under the laws of the People’s Republic of China as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moxian Shenzhen. Moxian Beijing is engaged in the business of internet technology, computer software, and commercial information consulting. 
 
On February 17, 2014, Moxian IP Samoa was incorporated in Samoa as a wholly-owned subsidiary of REBL. On February 19, 2014, Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Moxian IP Samoa, whereby Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen assigned and transferred all of the intellectual property rights that they respectively owned in connection with the Moxian business to Moxian IP Samoa in consideration of $1,000,000. 
 
On January 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement (the “Equity Transfer Agreement,” such transaction, the “Equity Transfer Transaction”) with REBL, to acquire from REBL 100% of the equity interests of Moxian IP Samoa for $6,782,000 (the “Moxian IP Samoa Purchase Price”). Moxian IP Samoa owns all the intellectual property rights relating to the operation, use and marketing of the Moxian Platform, including all of the trademarks, patents and copyrights that are used in the Company’s business. As a result of the Equity Transfer Transaction, Moxian IP Samoa became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

In addition, under the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Company and REBL agreed to terminate the License and Acquisition Agreement. Immediately prior to the execution of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Moxian BVI Purchase Price was not yet paid and no license maintenance royalty or earned royalty under the License and Acquisition Agreement had accrued. 
 
Under the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Company and REBL agreed to extinguish all of the Company’s liabilities owed to REBL under the License and Acquisition Agreement, other than the Moxian BVI Purchase Price. 
 
The Company agreed to issue to REBL a convertible promissory note for $7,782,000 (the “Rebel Note”), representing the sum of the Moxian IP Samoa Purchase Price and the Moxian BVI Purchase Price. The Rebel Note was due and payable on October 30, 2015 without any interest. The Company had the option to cause REBL to convert any and all amounts due under the Rebel Note into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the conversion price of $1.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”), if the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) of the Company’s Common Stock for a period of 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion was higher than the Conversion Price. The Company also had a right of first refusal to purchase the shares issuable upon conversion of the Rebel Note at the price of 80% of the VWAP for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of the proposed repurchase by the Company. 
 
On August 14, 2015, the VWAP of the Company’s Common Stock for 30 trading days prior to August 14, 2015 was higher than $1.00, which triggered the conversion of the Rebel Note. The Company notified REBL that it elected to cause it to convert $3,891,000 of the Rebel Note into 3,891,000 shares of its Common Stock (the “August Conversion”). As a result of the August Conversion, the remaining amount of the Rebel Note was $3,891,000. 
 
On September 30, 2015, the Company notified REBL that it elected to cause it to convert the remainder of the Rebel Note into 3,891,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “September Conversion”). After the August Conversion and September Conversion, the entire balance of the Rebel Note was converted into a total of 7,782,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. 
 
On November 14, 2016, the Company announced the completion of a public offering of 2,501,250 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $8.5 million after deducting placement agents’ commissions and other estimated offering expenses. In connection with the offering, the Company’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on November 15, 2016 under the symbol “MOXC”.

The following diagram sets forth the structure of the Company as of the date of this report: 
 

Our web site address is www.moxian.com. Information contained on our web site is not part of this report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 
 
Overview
 
We are in the O2O (“Online-to-Offline”) business. While there are many definitions of O2O, with respect to our business, O2O means providing an online platform for small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) with physical stores to conduct business online, interact with existing customers and obtain new customers. We refer to our customers as “Merchant Clients” and the existing and potential users of our platform as “Users.” Through our platform and the products and services offered through it, we seek to create interaction between our Users and Merchant Clients by allowing Merchant Clients to study consumer behavior. Our products and services are designed to allow Merchant Clients to conduct targeted advertising campaigns and promotions which are more effective because they are geared for those customers that a Merchant Client wishes to reach. Our platform is designed to encourage Users to return and to recruit new Users, each of which is a potential customer for our Merchant Clients.
 
We believe we are different from other companies in that our plan is to sign up merchants first and build our user base utilizing their customers.
 
The current version of our platform is called “Moxian+” which consists of our user mobile application (“App”) called the Moxian+ User App and a separate App for our Merchant Clients called the Moxian+ Business App. Both versions of the App are currently available in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store and can be downloaded free of charge. We also have a website that can be accessed at www.moxian.com where either App can also be downloaded.

Moxian principally operates in Shenzhen and Beijing.
 
As of September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017, our accumulated deficiency was approximately $47.3 million and $38.6 million, respectively. We have not generated any significant recurrent revenue since we started operations and our losses have grown to a level where the Company is unlikely to continue operations unless we have a fresh injection of capital or new funding. 
 
Going Concern

In assessing the Company’s liquidity and its ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of September 30, 2018, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded the current assets by approximately $10 million, The Company has stopped its sales operations for the time being while it reviews its options going forward.


In November 2016, the Company completed its initial public offering, (“IPO”) with net proceeds of $8.5 million but by September 30, 2017 it had substantially utilized these proceeds and had to resort to further funding.


On November 10, 2017, the Company and Ms. Liu Shu Juan (“Ms. Liu”), a director of the Company, entered into a convertible loan agreement for a line of credit of $1,000,000 or RMB equivalent. In March 2018, pursuant to the loan agreement, Moxian issued an unsecured convertible promissory note, bearing interest at the rate of 4.75% per annum, which note Ms. Liu converted in May 2018. She converted the total outstanding due to her of $1,008,008 into 350,003 ordinary shares of common stock at a conversion price of $2.88 per share.


In May 2018, Ms. Liu granted a further US$4 million facility to the Company bearing interest at the rate of 4.75% per annum and repayable after two years. and due in two years. In the course of fiscal 2018, the Company has principally relied on a draw-down of this facility to continue its operations.


Ms. Liu is the controlling shareholder of Shanghai Shewn Wine Co. Ltd. (“Shanghai Shewn”) which is in the business of distributing red wine and related accessories to retailers in various provinces in China. In November 2017, Ms. Liu seconded her General Manager, Yin Yi Jun (“Ethan Yin”) to work with Moxian in integrating the products and operations of both companies. Ethan Yin was appointed the Chief Executive Officer of Moxian in February 2018.


By the end of September 2018, although a $5.0 million loan had been approved by the Board, Ms. Liu did not proceed with further funding and Ethan Yin resigned as the CEO a month later in November 2018. The $4 million facility has been fully utilized and the Company is in need for further funding in order to continue its normal operations. Because certain staff have not been paid their salary arrears and long-service compensation, they reported their claims to the Shenzhen Labor Tribunal. As a result, the licenses of the Shenzhen Moxian and Moyi have been suspended by the Commerce Bureau and their bank accounts have been frozen. This matter has now been resolved. See Note 11 and 12 in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further details.


If the Company is unable to obtain the additional funding in the immediate future, it will have to cease operations on a permanent basis. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classifications of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Market Opportunities
 
The Company is in the business of mobile applications. 
 
It is estimated that China currently has more than 850 million users actively utilizing mobile applications as a result of the growth of the use of smart-phones, largely due to the availability of low-cost models produced by home-grown manufacturers such as Huawei, Vivo and Oppo.
 
O2O platforms link online users to physical stores and incorporate mobile payments as a key feature of their applications. Mobile payments are increasingly more popular and prevalent, with many consumers bypassing the use of debit and credit cards. As a result, store-based O2O commerce has experienced rapid growth with total sales of over $100 billion in 2017 and is projected to exceed US$140 billion by 2019.
 
Moxian has existed on the basis that the mobile application it has developed will be able to capture a share of this market by concentrating on the small and medium-sized enterprises in China that have limited budgets for advertising and marketing and may find that an online platform offers many advantages.
 
Products and Services
 
Moxian+ Business App Merchant Clients
 
The Moxian+ Business App is solely for use by Merchant Clients. The Moxian+ Business App allows them to manage their presence within the Moxian+ platform, plan a campaign, offer discounts, manage payments and receive analytics.
 
Our Targeted Marketing tools allow our Merchant Clients to send messages, promotions and advertisements to a specific group of Users and receive detailed analysis regarding buying patterns and customer preferences.
 
Moxian+ User App for Users
 
Our Users are referred to as “MO-Pals” within the User App. When they sign up for a Moxian+ account, they have to provide basic information and can then invite friends and family members to join Moxian+ as well.
 
The Moxian+ User App has a variety of features to attract and retain Users. The Moxian+ User App also provides access to a social media platform with a package of services to provide interaction with other Users and Merchant Clients. These services include MO-Talk, News Center with daily updates under “Hot Topics,” , Game Center and MO-Shake, which allows Users to win vouchers, discounts etc by shaking their phones.
 
Our Platform
 
The Moxian Platform is at the heart of our business. There are five components to our Moxian+ platform, which is the backend of our application, namely the social media engine, the e-commerce engine, the rewards engine, the gamification engine, and the analytical engine.
Social Media Engine
 
Our data use policy governs the use of information that users have chosen to share and present. We also design our products to include robust safety tools. We have worked with online safety experts to offer protection for all users, particularly teenagers. We work with law enforcement to help promote the safety of our users as required by law. To the extent permissible, and with prior consent from the Users, we analyze User’s information to understand the User’s behavior.
 
E-Commerce
 
Utilizing our e-commerce features, Merchant Clients are able to conduct business by posting products, offering coupons and sales as well as creating events and blogs through the Moxian+ Business App. On the other hand, Users can shop at the Merchant Clients’ shops like at any other e-commerce platform by ordering online and receiving the products by express delivery.

Rewards
 
Users are rewarded with MO-Points.. MO-Points are points granted to Users when they shop at Merchant Clients, play games on our platform or engage in other activities sponsored by the Merchant Clients. MO-Points can be redeemed at the Merchant Clients’ shops as determined by the Merchant Clients, or can be redeemed for MO-Coins which are a form of virtual currency and can be used at any Merchant Client’s stores.
 
MO-Points and MO-Coins are traceable and trackable on the Moxian+ platform through designated serial number so that we can see exactly what Users do with them and use that information to assist our Merchant Clients to determine customer behaviors.
 
From time to time, we may also give away MO-Points or MO-Coins as a promotion to increase our User base. We also plan to have our own “shopping mall” with merchandise that Users can purchase with MO-Points and MO-Coins in the upcoming year.
 
Gamification
 
Together with outside contractors, we develop games for Users to earn MO-Points and MO-Coins and other rewards which may be specific to a certain Merchant Client. Users can use MO-Points to play games offered in our game center.
Analytical Engine
 
Moxian provides analytics to each Merchant Client for the consumer behavior Moxian learns through its platform to assist our Merchant Clients to better design their promotions and reach their target audience. We analyze consumer behavior through “likes” of posts by certain merchants or the places they tend to “check-in” to, to determine their usual hang out.
Advertisements
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company entered into an Exclusive Partnership Agreement with Xinhua New Media Culture Communication Co. Ltd. (“Xinhua New Media”). Xinhua New Media is part of the Xinhua News Agency, the official news agency of the Peoples” Republic of China. It has developed an App that has a user population in the region of 120 million, many of whom are government employees and senior executives of quasi-government bodies and agencies.
 
Under the Agreement, the Company has the exclusive rights to operate the gaming channel on the Xinhua New Media app and can sell advertisement space on any part of the app.
 
The revenue from the sale of advertisement space forms the second part of our revenue.
 
Competition
 
In China, competition is stiff with industry giants like Baidu, Alibaba and Ten Cent that have well-established positions and are constantly upgrading their products. In addition, the growth of the O2O industry in recent years has seen the sprouting of many platform-based companies offering products for businesses and consumers. Such competitors, including Shou Qian Ba, La Shou and Le Hui have had varying degrees of success.
 
However, we believe that China is a huge market and there remain many opportunities for other players, particularly those catering for small and medium-sized enterprises or those that have specialized industry verticals.
 
Foreign Operations
 
All our business operations are in Mainland China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC. For example, our business activities subject us to a number of Chinese laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations, which have uncertainties. Any failure to comply with the PRC laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in China and harm our reputation.

Operating in foreign countries also subjects us to risk from currency fluctuations. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development department is responsible for developing and improving the mobile application, Moxian platform and customer experience in using our products. The Company has invested heavily in research and development efforts, spending over $2 million in each of the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 2017.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had a total of 34 employees, Because of a shortage of funds, the Company has been unable to pay the salaries of some of its employees. They have since gone to report their cases to the Labor Tribunal in Shenzhen for arbitration. Please refer to Note 12 to the accompanying financial statements for details.
 
PRC Law
 
Overview
 
The telecommunications and internet industry in China is highly regulated through various government agencies such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) and the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (“SAPPRFT”), the State Council Information Office (“SCIO”), the General Administration for Press and Publication (“GAPP”), and the Ministry of Public Security.
 
Among all the regulations, the Telecommunications Regulations of the People’s Republic of China, promulgated on September 25, 2000, is the primary governing law. The Telecom Regulations set out the general framework under which domestic Chinese companies such as the Company’s subsidiaries and VIE may engage in various types of telecommunications services in the PRC. They reiterate the long-standing principle that telecommunications service providers need to obtain operating licenses as a mandatory precondition to begin operation.
 
The Chinese government restricts foreign investment in Internet-related businesses. Accordingly, we operate our Internet-related businesses in China through Moyi, our VIE operating in Shenzhen, China.
 
Internet Information Services
 
The governing law for Internet information service is the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services, or the Internet Content Provider (“ICP”) Measures, which went into effect on September 25, 2000. Under the ICP Measures, any entity that provides information to online Internet users must obtain an operating license from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) or its local branch at the provincial level in accordance with the Telecom Regulations described above. The ICP Measures further stipulate that entities providing online information services in areas of news, publishing, education, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment must obtain permission from responsible national authorities prior to applying for an operating license from MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level. Moreover, ICPs must display their operating license numbers in a conspicuous location on their websites. ICPs must police their websites to remove categories of harmful content. Many of these requirements mirror Internet content restrictions that have been announced previously by PRC measures such as the MIIT and the SAPPRFT that derive their authority from the State Council.
 
Currently, Moyi holds an ICP license that was issued on January 22, 2014.
 
Online Privacy
 
Chinese law does not prohibit internet service providers from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users if the users agree to do so. The PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order internet service providers to submit personal information of an internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the internet.

Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services (“Order”) promulgated by the MIIT which became effective on March 15, 2012, internet service providers may not, without a user’s consent, collect the user’s personal information that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, and may not provide any user’s personal information to third parties without the prior consent of the user. Internet service providers may only collect users’ personal information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, scope and purpose of the collection and processing of such information. They are also required to ensure the proper security of users’ personal information, and take immediate remedial measures if such information is suspected to have been inappropriately disclosed. When a User registers to our application, we require our users to accept a user agreement whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. We will take other measures as necessary to comply with these provisions.
 
ICPs are also required to establish and publish their rules relating to personal information collection or use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing and technical services that involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. As to penalties, in very broad terms, the Order states that violators may face warnings, fines, and disclosure to the public and, in most severe cases, criminal liability.
 
Currently, our collection of the information from the Users is agreed to by the Users when they sign up. In addition, any data mining or analyzing of the user data is for internal use only. We also take steps to ensure that the data collected is stored securely.
 
Internet Publishing
 
On February 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT and MIIT jointly issued the Rules for the Administration for Internet Publishing Services, or the Internet Publishing Rules, which took effect on March 10, 2016, to replace the Provisional Rules for the Administration of Internet Publishing that had been jointly issued by the SAPPRFT and MIIT on June 27, 2002. The Internet Publishing Rules define “Internet publications” as digital works that are edited, produced or processed to be published and provided to the public through the Internet, including (a) original digital works, such as pictures, maps, games and comics; (b) digital works with content that is consistent with the type of content that, prior to the Internet age, typically was published in media such as books, newspapers, periodicals, audio-visual products and electronic publications; (c) digital works in the form of online databases complied by selecting, arranging and compiling other types of digital works; and (d) types of digital works identified by the SAPPRFT. Under the Internet Publishing Rules, Internet operators distributing such Internet publications via information network are required to apply for an Internet publishing license with the relevant governmental authorities and submit the application, if approved, to the SAPPRFT for approval before distributing Internet publications. Moxian plans to apply for an Internet publishing license.
Online Games
 
On May 10, 2003, the Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Online Culture were issued by the Ministry of Culture (“MCPRC”) and went into effect on July 1, 2003 (these regulations were revised by MCPRC on July 1, 2004). According to these regulations, commercial entities are required to apply to the relevant local branch of MCPRC for an Online Culture Operating Permit to engage in online games services.
 
On July 27, 2004, GAPP and the State Copyright Bureau jointly promulgated the Notice on Carrying out the Decision from the State Council Regarding the Approval of Electronic and Online Games Publications, or the Games Notice. According to the Games Notice, the Internet Publications Distribution License is required for publishing online games.
 
From year 2004 to 2016, MCPRC had issued several measures or regulations regulating the Online Games industry and thus we are subject to more strict regulations. 
 
Currently, Moxian holds the appropriate license that was issued by the Administration of Online Culture on November 25, 2015.

Encryption Software
 
On October 7, 1999, the State Encryption Administration Commission published the Regulations for the Administration of Commercial Encryption, followed by the first Notice of the General Office of the State Encryption Administration Commission on November 8, 1999. Both these regulations address the use of software in China with encryption functions. According to these regulations, purchase of encryption products must be reported. Violation of the encryption regulations may result in a warning, penalty, confiscation of the encryption product, or criminal liabilities.
 
On March 18, 2000, the Office of the State Commission for the Administration of Cryptography issued a public announcement regarding the implementation of those regulations. The announcement clarifies the encryption regulations as below:
 

● | Only specialized hardware and software, the core functions of which are encryption and decoding, fall within the administrative scope of the regulations as “encryption products and equipment containing encryption technology.” Other products such as wireless telephones, Windows software and browsers do not fall within the scope of this regulation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PRC government has already begun to study the laws in question in accordance with WTO rules and China’s external commitments, and will make revisions wherever necessary. The Administrative Regulations on Commercial Encryption will also be subject to such scrutiny and revision.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In late 2005, the Administration Bureau of Cryptography further issued a series of regulations to regulate the development, production and sales of commercial encryption products, which all came into effect on January 1, 2006.
 
We believe that the Company is in proper compliance with these requirements.
 
Foreign Exchange
 
Foreign exchange regulation in China is primarily governed by the following regulations:
 

● | Foreign Exchange Administration Rules, or the Exchange Rules of the PRC, promulgated by the State Council on January 29, 1996, which was amended on January 14, 1997 and on August 5, 2008 respectively; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, or the Administration Rules promulgated by China People’s Bank on June 20, 1996.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the Exchange Rules of the PRC, Renminbi is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still generally subject to the approval or verification of SAFE.
 
Under the Administration Rules, enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies at banks that are authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after the enterprise provides valid commercial documents and relevant supporting documents and, in the case of certain capital account transactions, after obtaining approval from SAFE or its competent local branches. Capital investments by enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, SAFE and the National Development and Reform Commission, or their respective competent local branches.

On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Circular on Several Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents to Engage in Financing and in Return Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Companies, or Circular No. 75, which went into effect on November 1, 2005. Circular No. 75 provides that if PRC residents use assets or equity interests in their PRC entities to establish offshore companies or inject assets or equity interests of their PRC entities into offshore companies for the purpose of overseas capital financing, they must register with local SAFE branches with respect to their investments in offshore companies. Circular No. 75 also requires PRC residents to file changes to their registration if their special purpose companies undergo material events such as capital increase or decrease, share transfer or exchange, merger or division, long-term equity or debt investments, provision of guaranty to a foreign party, etc. SAFE further promulgated the Implementing Rules for Circular No. 75, or Circular No. 106, clarifying and supplementing the concrete operating rules that shall be followed during the implementation and application of Circular No. 75.
 
On August 29, 2008, the Notice of the General Affairs Department of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-funded Enterprises, or the Improvement Notice, was promulgated by SAFE. Pursuant to the Improvement Notice, the foreign currency capital of Foreign Investment Entities, after being converted to Renminbi, can only be used for doing business within the business scope approved by relevant governmental authorities, and shall not be used for domestic equity investment except as otherwise explicitly provided by laws and regulations.
 
On July 14, 2014, SAFE issued a new Circular on Several Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents to Engage in Investing and Financing and in Return Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Companies, or Circular No. 37, which enlarges the definition of SPV comparing to the Circular No. 75, which can invest in China under Circular No. 37. The method of investment include forming a new entity in China and through merging or acquiring a domestic company in China.
 
In March 2015, SAFE released the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or FIEs, or the Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement Circular, which became effective from June 1, 2015. This circular replaced SAFE’s previous related circulars, including the Circular on Issues Relating to the Improvement of Business Operation with Respect to the Administration of Foreign Exchange Capital Payment and Settlement of Foreign Invested Enterprises. The Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement Circular clarifies that FIEs may settle a specified proportion of their foreign exchange capital in banks at their discretion, and may choose the timing for such settlement. The proportion of foreign exchange capital to be settled at FIEs’ discretion for the time being is 100% and the SAFE may adjust the proportion in due time based on the situation of international balance of payments. The circular also stipulates that FIEs’ usage of capital and settled foreign exchange capital shall comply with relevant provisions concerning foreign exchange control and be subject to the management of a negative list. The FIEs’ capital and Renminbi capital gained from the settlement of foreign exchange capital may not be directly or indirectly used for expenditure beyond the business scope of the FIEs or as prohibited by laws and regulations of the PRC. Such capital also may not be directly or indirectly used for issuing Renminbi entrusted loans except as permitted by the business scope of the FIE, for repaying inter-enterprise borrowings including any third party advance, or for repaying the bank loans denominated in RMB that have been sub-lent to a third party.
 
On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular on Reform and Regulating of the Administrative Policy of the Settlement under Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16, which became effective on the same date. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 16, FIEs may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or choose to follow the “conversion-at-will” system for foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise elects the conversion-at-will system for foreign currency settlement, it may convert, in part or in whole, the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if such FIE needs to make payment from such designated account, it does not need to go through a lengthy approval process, but instead is only required to declare its intended use for such converted Renminbi. Although Circular 16 effectively simplifies the administrative process for converting foreign currencies into Renminbi for settlement of capital account items, the Notice on Further Promoting the Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Improving Authenticity and Compliance Review (Hui Fa [2017] No.3), or the Notice of No.3, released by SAFE on January 26, 2017, requires a domestic company to provide explanations to the banks through which it seeks to exchange currency of the sources of funds for investment and the intended use of such funds. Under Notice No.3, submission of relevant corporate documents, including board resolutions and relevant contracts is also required to support a domestic company’s claim of intended use.
