  Display Solutions 
 Display Driver Characteristics. Display drivers deliver defined analog voltages and currents that activate pixels to exhibit images on displays. The following key characteristics determine display driver performance and end-market application: 
 

• | Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution determines the level of detail displayed within an image and is defined by the number of pixels per line multiplied by the number of lines on a display. For large displays, higher resolution typically requires more display drivers for each panel. Display drivers that have a greater number of channels, however, generally require fewer display drivers for each panel and command a higher selling price per unit. Mobile displays, conversely, are typically single chip solutions designed to deliver a specific resolution. We cover resolutions ranging from VGA (640 x 480) to UHD (3840 x 2160).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a panel. For example, for TFT-LCD panels, 262 thousand colors are supported by 6-bit source drivers; 16 million colors are supported by 8-bit source drivers; and 1 billion colors are supported by 10-bit source drivers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational Voltage. Display drivers are characterized by input and output voltages. Source drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages between 9 and 18 volts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages from 30 to 45 volts. Lower input voltage results in lower power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to the pixel by the source driver is referred to as the gamma curve. The gamma curve of the source driver can correct some imperfections in picture quality in a process generally known as gamma correction. Some advanced display drivers feature up to three independent gamma curves to facilitate this correction.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and the display drivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data transfer rate necessary for higher definition images. The principal types of interface technologies are embedded clock point to point interface (EPI), mini-low voltage differential signaling (m-LVDS), unified standard interface (USI) and mobile industry processor interface (MIPI).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses COF, COG and COP package types.

Sales and Marketing 
 We focus our sales and marketing strategy on continuing to grow and leverage our existing relationships with leading consumer electronics OEMs, while expanding into industrial and automotive end markets. We believe our close collaboration with customers allows us to align our product and technology development with our customers’ existing and future needs. Because our customers often service multiple end markets, our product sales teams are organized by customers within the major geographies. We believe this facilitates the sale of products that address multiple end-market applications to each of our customers. 
 We sell our products through a direct sales force and a network of authorized agents and distributors. We have strategically located our sales and technical support offices near our customers. Our direct sales force consists primarily of representatives co-located with our design center in Korea, as well as our local sales and support offices and sales liaisons in Japan, Greater China, Taiwan and Europe. We have a network of agents and 
 
12 

  distributors in United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we derived 62%, 75% and 75% of net sales from our standard products business through our direct sales force, respectively, and 38%, 25% and 25% of net sales from our standard products business through our network of authorized agents and distributors, respectively. 
 Customers 
 We sell our Display Solutions and Power Solutions products to consumer, computing and industrial electronics OEMs, original design manufacturers and electronics manufacturing services companies, as well as subsystem designers. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our ten largest customers accounted for 79.8%, 87.6% and 89.5% of net sales from our standard products business, respectively. Our arrangements with and reliance on key customers, particularly customers for our display products, may make it less practicable to pursue certain opportunities with other potential new and existing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to Samsung Display represented 42.5% of net sales from our standard products business and 89.7% of our Display Solutions division’s net sales, and SAMT represented 10.4% of net sales from our standard products business and 19.8% of our Power Solutions division’s net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to Samsung Display represented 56.2% of net sales from our standard products business and 87.5% of our Display Solutions division’s net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Samsung Display represented 53.8% of net sales from our standard products business and 84.5% of our Display Solutions division’s net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded revenues of $6.1 million from customers in the US and $427.0 million from all foreign countries, of which 47.2% was from Greater China, 26.6% from Korea and 18.9% from Vietnam. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded revenues of $5.1 million from customers in the US and $460.4 million from all foreign countries, of which 61.9% was from Greater China, 23.1% from Korea and 10.8% from Vietnam. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded revenues of $2.4 million from customers in the US and $482.4 million from all foreign countries, of which 68.2% was from Greater China and 27.5% from Korea. All information pertaining to the geographic source of revenues is with respect to the geographic location to which our products are billed. 
Intellectual Property 
 As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio of intellectual property assets included approximately 1,004 registered patents and 142 pending patent applications. Approximately 490 and 46 of our patents and pending applications, respectively, are novel in that they are not a foreign counterpart of an existing patent or patent application. Because we file patents in multiple jurisdictions, we additionally have approximately 514 registered patents and 96 pending applications that relate to identical technical claims in our base patent portfolio. Our patents expire at various times approximately over the next 19 years. While these patents are in the aggregate important to our competitive position, we do not believe that any single registered or pending patent is material to us. 
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology and know-how, as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.” 
National Core Technology 
 Under the Act on Prevention of Leakage and Protection of Industrial Technology of Korea (the “ITA”), any export (including various means of outflow such as sale or transfer outside Korea) of technology designated as “national core technology” (“National Core Technology” or “NCT”) by the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (the “MOTIE”) requires the filing of a prior-report with, and the acceptance of the same by, the MOTIE. Any such export of NCT without the acceptance of the prior report with the MOTIE may be subject to corrective orders by the relevant authorities, and failure to comply with such corrective orders may potentially result in criminal liabilities. 
 
13 

  The Notification Regarding Designation of National Core Technologies issued by the MOTIE was amended on July 14, 2021 to add certain technologies to the list of National Core Technology designated by the MOTIE, and the amended list includes the design technology for OLED Display Driver IC for driving display panels (“OLED DDI”). In the ordinary course of business, our Korean subsidiary may provide certain information relating to its products, including OLED DDI, to customers, suppliers or vendors, and such disclosure of information may be subject to the NCT-related regulations under the ITA, and therefore the MOTIE’s acceptance of prior-reports. Since the amendment of the foregoing NCT list in July 2021, we have filed prior-reports with the MOTIE for the export of our OLED DDI product-related information to certain overseas vendors that manufacture our products, and all such reports have thus far been accepted by the MOTIE. 
 Competition 
 We operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change and continually advancing customer requirements. Although no one company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in each of our market segments. Our competitors include other independent and captive manufacturers and designers of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, including display driver and power management semiconductor devices. 
 We compete based on design experience, manufacturing capabilities, the ability to satisfy customer needs from the design phase through the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle and quality of technical support and sales personnel. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on internal and external variables, both within and outside of our control. These variables include the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields, capacity availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 
 Human Capital 
 Our worldwide workforce consisted of 890 employees (full- and part-time) as of December 31, 2021, of which 188 were involved in sales, marketing, general and administrative, 232 in research and development (including 100 with advanced degrees), 41 in quality, reliability and assurance, and 429 in manufacturing (comprised of 46 in engineering and 383 in operations, maintenance and others). Our employees leverage their extensive expertise in engineering, design and process to accelerate the advancement of technology and be leaders in our industry. We pride our company on being a great workplace where employees from diverse backgrounds can reach their full potential. 
Labor Unions 
 As disclosed in previous reports, we have a labor union at our Korean subsidiary (the “First Union”). On Sep 16, 2021, the formation of a second labor union at our Korean subsidiary (the “Second Union”) was approved by the local authorities (the First Union and the Second Union are collectively referred to as the “Magnachip Semiconductor Labor Unions”). Both the First Union and the Second Union are members of a supervisory association named “Federation of Korean Trade Unions.” The First Union represents member employees who are factory workers and the Second Union represents member employees who are office workers, in both cases at our Korean subsidiary. 
 As of December 31, 2021, of the 868 employees at our Korean subsidiary, 389 were represented by the First Union, and 82 employees were represented by the Second Union. Approximately 53% of our employees at our Korean subsidiary were represented by the Magnachip Semiconductor Labor Unions. 
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we encounter future labor problems, we may fail to deliver our products and services in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”

  Values and Culture 
 Our core values represent a commitment to building an environment of trust with our employees, customers, investors and the communities in which we operate. Through our values and culture, we strive to shape a better future not only for ourselves and our customers, but for humanity as a whole. At Magnachip, we strive to foster effective collaboration by respecting different perspectives, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and supporting one another. 
Inclusion and Diversity 
 We support all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, age, veteran status, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion or disability. We place great importance on inclusion and diversity within the workplace. An inclusive and diverse culture creates a happier, more relaxed work environment. 
Labor and Ethics 
 Magnachip strives to provide and maintain a working environment where management and employees are happy and treated with dignity and respect. Magnachip adheres to human rights and labor standards of international labor organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Labor Organization. Magnachip prohibits all forms of discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion and age to ensure all employees work in a safe and fair environment. 
Empowering Great Talent 
 We offer a variety of offline training programs, including courses in the areas of design, engineering and technology, as well as courses at different job levels and leadership education. We also offer a number of online training programs, including in the areas of management/leadership and business skills such as presentation, negotiation, reporting, Information Technology and foreign language, which allow employees to improve their capabilities without time and space constraints. Every year, a majority of our employees are required to complete certain educational programs in the areas of information security, industrial safety and health, and sexual harassment prevention. 
 We believe the foundation of Magnachip is our research and development (“R&D”) talent. To ensure R&D technical professionals continue to advance their skills and knowledge, we have technology committees that attend regular seminars and conduct periodic research. We have a reward program for exemplary research. 
 We also offer a Vision Seminar, which is led by our CEO and is designed to share our company’s vision, strategy and the management’s key messages to employees. Additionally, the CEO and management regularly communicate with employees through CEO letters and town hall meetings. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We strive to reward employees with competitive compensation based on contribution and performance. We periodically evaluate market practices for compensation and benefits, including with respect to job function, role and responsibility, job level and region, and regularly review whether our compensation levels and distribution methods are fair and equitable. Additionally, we have long- and mid-term retention programs to attract and retain high-performing key talent. 
 We offer various employee benefits under the company philosophy that ensuring employees enjoy a happier life with their families is as critical as promoting their own health and well-being. All employees and their family members have access to annual medical checkup programs. Employees also have access to other benefits such as personal pensions, housing assistance, medical reimbursement plans and educational assistance programs.

  Safety and Wellness 
 During and after the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority is ensuring health and safety of our employees and their families. We built a companywide control tower to provide appropriate response guidance as the pandemic has evolved, and have secured internal/external capabilities to respond to emergencies systematically. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly instituted infrastructure to support remote working, so that our employees could work from home in a safe and stable environment. In addition, we have installed safety facilities within our business sites. 
Environmental 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) and waste, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Since 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulation, the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme, or K-ETS, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing the emission or purchasing the allowances from other participants in the emission trading market. 
 Another example is the newly reinforced regulations on chemicals under Chemicals Control Act and K-REACH, which came into effect on January 1, 2015. Under these laws, our Korean subsidiary is required to comply with various requirements to report, evaluate, manage and ensure the safe usage of the chemicals used in its facilities. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be in compliance with all of these laws and regulations, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws and the failure to comply with new or existing laws or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations. 
Raw Materials 
 We use processes that require specialized raw materials that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. We continue to attempt to qualify additional suppliers for our raw materials. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, has adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These “conflict minerals” are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products.”
