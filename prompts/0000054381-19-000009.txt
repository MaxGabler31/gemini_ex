ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

GENERAL
Kaman Corporation, headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, was incorporated in 1945. We are a diversified company that conducts business in the aerospace and industrial distribution markets. We report information for ourselves and our subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company”) in two business segments, Distribution and Aerospace. A discussion of 2018 developments is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.
Distribution Segment
The Distribution segment brings our commitment to technological leadership and value-added services to the distribution business. The Distribution segment is a leading power transmission, automation and fluid power industrial distributor with operations throughout the United States. With approximately 6 million SKUs, we provide electro-mechanical products, bearings, power transmission, motion control and electrical and fluid power components, along with engineered integrated solutions for our customers' most challenging applications, serving a broad spectrum of industrial markets including both maintenance, repair and overhaul ("MRO") and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers. With approximately 220 service facilities, including distribution centers, assembly, fabrication and repair facilities, Kaman provides products and service solutions to approximately 55,000 active customers representing a highly diversified cross section of industries. 
Aerospace Segment
The Aerospace segment produces and markets proprietary aircraft bearings and components; super precision miniature ball bearings for the medical, industrial and aerospace markets; complex metallic and composite aerostructures for commercial, military and general aviation fixed and rotary wing aircraft; and safe and arming solutions for missile and bomb systems for the U.S. and allied militaries. The segment also markets the design and supply of aftermarket parts to businesses performing MRO in aerospace markets; performs helicopter subcontract work; restores, modifies and supports our SH-2G Super Seasprite maritime helicopters; and manufactures and supports our K-MAX® manned and unmanned medium-to-heavy lift helicopters.
Principal customers include the U.S. military, foreign allied militaries, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, The Boeing Company, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Rolls Royce, Raytheon and Bell Helicopter. The SH-2G aircraft is currently in service with the Egyptian Air Force and the New Zealand, Peruvian and Polish navies. Operations are conducted throughout the United States, as well as in facilities located in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Singapore. Additionally, the Company maintains an investment in a joint venture in India. 
WORKING CAPITAL
A discussion of our working capital is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, in this Form 10-K.
Our Distribution segment requires substantial working capital related to accounts receivable and inventories. Significant amounts of inventory are carried to meet our customers’ requirements. Sales returns do not have a material effect on our working capital requirements.
Our Aerospace segment’s working capital requirements are dependent on the nature and life cycles of the programs for which work is performed. New programs may initially require higher working capital to complete nonrecurring start-up activities and fund the purchase of inventory and equipment necessary to perform the work. Nonrecurring start-up costs on large and complex programs often take longer to recover, negatively impacting working capital in the short-term and producing a corresponding benefit in future periods. As these programs mature and efficiencies are gained in the production process, working capital requirements generally decrease.
Our credit agreement includes a revolving credit facility which is available for additional working capital requirements and investment opportunities. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 12, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each business segment’s products and services to consolidated net sales for each of the three most recently completed years:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Sales | | | | | 
Distribution | 60.8 | % | | 59.9 | % | 61.2 | %
Aerospace | 39.2 | % | | 40.1 | % | 38.8 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
While we believe we have sufficient sources for the materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing activities, we are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium, nickel, steel, copper and composites. Many major components and product equipment items are procured from or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and non-U.S. companies. Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability, while jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. From time to time, we have experienced shortages in raw materials which have impacted our near term results; however, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on either of our business segments. For further discussion of the possible effects of changes in the cost or availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10-K.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We hold patents and trademarks reflecting functional, design and technical accomplishments in a wide range of areas covering both basic production of certain aerospace products as well as highly specialized devices and advanced technology products in defense related and commercial fields.

Although the Company's patents and trademarks enhance our competitive position, we believe that none of such patents or trademarks is singularly or as a group essential to our business as a whole. We hold or have applied for U.S. and foreign patents with expiration dates that range through the year 2035.

Registered trademarks of the Company include KAflex®, KAron®, and K-MAX®. In all, we maintain 28 U.S. and foreign trademarks.

BACKLOG
The majority of our backlog is attributable to the Aerospace segment. We anticipate that approximately 59.1% of our Aerospace backlog at the end of 2018 will be performed in 2019. Approximately 37.4% of the Aerospace segment's backlog at the end of 2018 is related to U.S. Government ("USG") contracts or subcontracts.
Total backlog at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and the portion of the backlog we expect to complete in 2019, is as follows:

 | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2018 | | 2018 Backlog to becompleted in 2019 | | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2017 | | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2016
In thousands | | | | | | | 
Aerospace | $ | 851,814 | | | $ | 503,553 | | $ | 616,090 | $ | 581,619
Distribution | 134,332 | | | 134,332 | | | 126,025 | | 108,681
Total | $ | 986,146 | | | $ | 637,885 | | $ | 742,115 | $ | 690,300

Backlog related to uncompleted contracts for which we have recorded a provision for estimated losses was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, backlog related to firm but not yet funded orders was not material. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion.
REGULATORY MATTERS

Government Contracts
The USG, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience or for default if we fail to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the USG would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The USG can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.
During 2018, approximately 97.7% of the work performed by the Company directly or indirectly for the USG was performed on a fixed-price basis and the balance was performed on a cost-reimbursement basis. Under a fixed-price contract, the price paid to the contractor is negotiated at the outset of the contract and is not generally subject to adjustment to reflect the actual costs incurred by the contractor in the performance of the contract. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and an additional negotiated fee.
Compliance with Environmental Protection Laws
Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters in an effort to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the USG. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if more stringent clean-up standards are imposed, additional contamination is discovered and/or clean-up costs are higher than estimated.
See Environmental Matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Critical Accounting Estimates - Environmental Costs in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion of our environmental matters.

With respect to all other matters that may currently be pending, in the opinion of management, based on our analysis of relevant facts and circumstances, we do not believe that compliance with relevant environmental protection laws is likely to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In arriving at this conclusion, we have taken into consideration site-specific information available regarding total costs of any work to be performed and the extent of work previously performed. If we are identified as a “potentially responsible party” ("PRP") by environmental authorities at a particular site, we, using information available to us, will also review and consider a number of other factors, including: (i) the financial resources of other PRPs involved in each site and their proportionate share of the total volume of waste at the site; (ii) the existence of insurance, if any, and the financial viability of the insurers; and (iii) the success others have had in receiving reimbursement for similar costs under similar insurance policies issued during the periods applicable to each site.
International Operations
Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 ("ITRA") added subsection (r) to section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), requiring a public reporting issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with local law. Issuers must also file a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") if any disclosable activities under ITRA have been included in the annual or quarterly report. We did not have any disclosable activities during the year ended December 31, 2018.
COMPETITION
The Distribution segment competes for business with several other national distributors of bearings, power transmission, motion control and electrical and fluid power products, two of which are substantially larger, and with many regional and local distributors and OEMs. Competitive forces have intensified due to the increasing trend towards corporate contracts, customers' efforts to obtain material cost savings and the extension of supplier product authorizations within the distribution channel. We compete for business based upon the breadth and quality of products offered, product availability, delivery performance, and price, as well as on the basis of value-added services that we are able to provide.
The Aerospace segment operates in a highly competitive environment with many other organizations, some of which are substantially larger than us and have greater financial strength and more extensive resources. We compete for composite and metallic aerostructures subcontracts, and helicopter sales and structures, bearings and components business on the basis of price and/or quality; product endurance and special performance characteristics; proprietary knowledge; the quality of our products and services; the availability of facilities, equipment and personnel to perform contracts; and the reputation of our business. Competitors for our business include small machine shops and offshore manufacturing facilities. We compete for advanced technology fuzing business primarily on the basis of technical competence, product quality and price, and also on the basis of our experience as a developer and manufacturer of fuzes for particular weapon types and the availability of our facilities, equipment and personnel. We are also affected by the political and economic circumstances of our potential foreign customers and, in certain situations, the relationships of those foreign customers with the USG, the USG's perceptions of those foreign customers and the ability to obtain necessary export approvals, licenses or authorizations from the U.S. Government.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,100 individuals.
