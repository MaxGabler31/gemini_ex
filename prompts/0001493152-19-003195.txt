The Company conducts its operations through three operating segments: Strong Cinema, Convergent and Strong Outdoor. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we separated our former Digital Media segment into two separate segments - Convergent and Strong Outdoor. All prior periods have been recast in our segment reporting to reflect the current segment organization.
 
The Company’s strategic plan contemplates a combination of:
 

● | Investing in the operations and growth of our existing businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluating opportunities to maximize value by monetizing investments in our existing businesses; and 
● | Investing in public companies, private companies or other areas. 

 
These investments may involve investments in other public companies or acquisitions of businesses, which may be within or outside of the Company’s existing markets. We intend our investments in public companies to be made in circumstances where we believe that we will be able to exercise significant influence or control. The Company may also seek to sell a minority, majority or all of its existing businesses as part of its holding company strategy.
 
The Company holds investments in two public companies: approximately 17.3% of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIH), a provider of property and casualty insurance in the States of Louisiana, Texas and Florida and 32.3% of Itasca Capital Ltd. (TSX Venture: ICL), a holding company that holds a significant position in Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB), a leading commercial provider of HVAC construction and related services.
 
Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, the funds that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates together currently hold approximately 36.1% of the Company’s outstanding stock. In some cases, funds managed by Fundamental Global Investors, LLC may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global Investors’ funds currently hold positions in 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Itasca Capital Ltd.
 
Operating Segments
 
Strong Cinema
 
Overview
 
We provide high quality projection screens, technical support services and other related products to the cinema exhibition industry. We also distribute and support third party products including digital projectors, servers, library management systems, menu boards and sound systems.
Products
 
Cinema Screens and Support Systems — We are the largest supplier of premium projection screens to the cinema industry in North America. We have an exclusive relationship to supply large format screens to IMAX theaters and supply most of the other major cinema operators worldwide. We also manufacture innovative screen support structures custom built to adapt to virtually any venue requirement, with a unique self-standing modular construction that allows for easy assembly and adjustable size.
 
In addition, we manufacture and distribute screens outside of the cinema industry for special events and theme parks. Our Eclipse curvilinear screens are designed to provide maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. The solid surface minimizes light loss to maintain higher resolution at lower lumen output. Patented speaker panels allow selective placement of rear mounted speakers to ensure the audio derives from the source media on screen. Applications include interactive dark rides, 3D/4D theme park rides, flying theaters and motion simulators.
 
We believe that our screens are the highest quality in the industry, driven by our innovative manufacturing process, focus on quality control and our proprietary coatings. We believe we are the only major screen manufacturer that develops and produces its own proprietary coatings, which are critical to the overall quality, increased screen reflectivity and brightness and continued innovation of our screens.

Technical Services – We provide digital cinema equipment installations and after-sale maintenance and network support services to the cinema industry. Our field service technicians and our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) staff work hand in hand to resolve system and other issues for our cinema customers. We service our customers under recurring revenue contracts providing for maintenance and repair to a wide range of installed digital equipment, providing our customers with a reliable turnkey outsourced service option. We also provide services to our customers not covered by maintenance contracts on a time and materials basis. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures.
 
Other Products – We distribute projectors, servers, audio systems and other third-party products including library management systems, lenses and lamps to our cinema customers in North and South America.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia. Screen systems are primarily sold on a direct basis, although we also use third-party distributors and integrators in some markets.
 
We have non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and Barco that allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America.
 
We provide technical services in the United States. We market and sell our services directly to theater owners and through dealers or Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) networks.
 
Competition
 
While there are numerous smaller screen manufacturing companies, the primary competitor in the worldwide cinema screen market is Harkness Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability, location and price.
 
The markets for other Strong Cinema products and services are highly competitive and the industry is fragmented. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes other integrators and resellers. Manufacturers may also sell equipment directly to cinema exhibitors, especially for large orders. Our primary competition for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is Christie Digital, as well as smaller suppliers and in some cases internal resources of cinema exhibitors.
 
Convergent
 
Overview
 
Convergent delivers digital signage solutions and services to various enterprise markets, including retail, banking and healthcare, as well as certain government agencies and Digital-Out-Of-Home (“DOOH”) advertising network operators. These markets are served through the capabilities that we developed from the acquisition of Convergent in 2013. While there is digital signage equipment sold within this segment, the primary focus of this segment is providing integrated, fully-managed solutions to our customers. We market these solutions as “Digital Signage as a Service” (DSaaS) because they provide an end-to-end solution that includes hardware, software, content development and distribution, network monitoring, support and field maintenance services, all for a single monthly fee. Our “as-a-service” model lowers up-front customer capital costs, allows customers to scale more easily and allows them to ‘turn on’ or ‘turn off’ features as needed.

Interactive Solutions
 
IMPACT – This consumer-facing digital signage solution enables retailers, banks and healthcare providers to promote their products and services and thereby improve the consumer experience, enhance their brand and positively impact sales. It supports single and multi-screen video walls, large-scale LED displays and storefront window displays. Optional services include touchscreens with interactive applications to get information about merchandise (“Lift & Learn”) and enable searching and ordering merchandise that’s not available in the store (“Endless Aisle”). It also includes access to a web portal that enables customers to view the availability of their digital signage network and the content being played at any time.
 
INSPIRE – This employee-facing digital signage solution enables enterprise businesses and government organizations to more effectively communicate with their employees to improve productivity by reinforcing training and delivering motivational messaging, and reduce operational costs through greater compliance and reduced employee turnover. It supports regular displays and touchscreens, typically situated in retail storage rooms, lunchrooms, distribution centers, factories, call centers and sales offices. Optional services include syndicated feeds for news, weather, traffic, and wellness information; social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, Instagram); custom designed motion graphic videos that are fed from a web form or other data source; and data visualization templates that display information from a customer database or application. This service also supports live-streaming of town hall meetings, storage and playback of videos (“Video-on-Demand”), and the ability to programmatically switch from the digital signage content to regular TV content from the customer’s cable or satellite TV set-top box. It also includes access to a web portal that enables customers to view the availability of their digital signage network and the content being played at any time.
 
INFLUENCE – This digital signage solution is designed specifically for Digital Out of Home (DOOH) ad network operators. It enables these companies to efficiently and cost-effectively distribute advertising to digital billboard and long-form video content to TVs in bars/restaurants and waiting rooms. Key features included peer-to-peer sharing of content to minimize internet bandwidth consumption for large video files, audience-analytics using a camera to measure viewer demographics and dwell time, and proof-of-play reporting. It also supports role-based access to a portal that enables advertisers to upload and schedule playback of their content in the specific time-slots that have been assigned to them by the customer, and view the availability of their digital signage network at any time.
 
Products and Services
 
Digital Signage as a Service (DSaaS) Platform – Our platform leverages internally developed and third-party software to automate the customer’s digital signage workflow, including from content creation, approval, storage and management, network deployment, monitoring, case management and incident resolution. Since it is cloud-based, it provides inherent scalability to enable customers to expand their network. The DSaaS platform supports a wide range of applications – all of which are managed through a web portal. New features and functionality are frequently added, both through the efforts of our in-house software development team and integration with an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party applications. We primarily use media players from BrightSign, LLC in our DSaaS offerings. Our DSaaS offerings provide the Company with recurring revenue.
 
Content Creation – We provide creative services to digital signage clients that include media strategy, content design and production. Our creative services team develops custom content to support the branding and marketing initiatives of each client.
 
Content Management and Distribution – Content management is provided to ensure accurate playback at the right place and at the right time based on a number of factors such as geography, site characteristics, location within a site or consumer demographics. We utilize our DSaaS platform for the management and distribution of content. Content is prepared, scheduled and centrally distributed from our cloud infrastructure.
 
Network Operations Center – Our NOC in Alpharetta, GA provides similar services to our Convergent customers as described under Strong Cinema above.
 
Installation and Maintenance – We provide digital signage installations and post-sale onsite maintenance services. Field technicians work closely with our NOC staff to resolve systems issues that cannot be fixed remotely. Each is certified to install and service a wide array of digital signage and audio equipment from a number of manufacturers. We offer cabling, wiring, installation and maintenance services in combination with the above digital signage solutions. We also offer long-term contractual service packages for installation, support and maintenance of satellite networks. The latter service stems from Convergent’s history of building satellite-based broadcast TV networks for corporations and government agencies, which they use primarily for training and town hall meetings.

Measurement and Analytics – We offer the tools and resources to measure the impact of digital signage solutions. We develop measurement criteria, establish benchmarks and identify control mechanisms to test the effectiveness of such solutions during proof of concept and full rollout scenarios.
 
Markets
 
Digital Signage – The digital signage market broadly defined includes all uses of digital display technologies and services to project promotional and informative content in the form of images, graphics, design collaterals, videos and creative advertising on digital displays. However, the Company is focused on certain segments of the market that use digital signage to (a) attract consumers into retail stores, banks and restaurants and attempt to influence their purchase decisions, and (b) engage employees with salient corporate messaging intended to positively influence their behavior. The primary sectors for these services include retail, hospitality, banking, healthcare, manufacturing and distribution.
 
Digital Out-of-Home – The DOOH advertising market is a subset of the overall out-of-home advertising market that includes in-store digital displays and interactive promotion kiosks. DOOH marketing campaigns consist of a network of digital displays that are centrally managed and target both mobile and captive customers outside the home. Some definitions of the DOOH market include digital signage used by companies to promote their goods and services. However, in this context, we define it as digital signage that is used for advertising any goods and services. We are primarily focused on pursuing DOOH communication opportunities within the hospitality and transportation markets.
 
Enterprise Video – The Enterprise Video market consists of organizations seeking to use video communications for employee training and town hall meetings. We are primarily focused on pursuing Enterprise Video opportunities within the government, banking, retail and corporate markets.
 
Competition
 
There are many players in our markets who have expertise in integration. Some of the key players include Diversified Media Group and Stratacache.
 
Strong Outdoor
 
Overview
 
We provide advertising services and experiential marketing services through Strong Outdoor. We started the business in early 2018 and provide out-of-home advertising services on over 3,500 taxicabs in New York City. We established Strong Digital Media, LLC as the legal entity to conduct this business. We sell advertising to corporate media buyers and advertising agencies for display on vinyl printed signs and digital signs.
 
In 2019, we are expanding Strong Outdoor to include experiential marketing services and may expand Strong Outdoor’s services in other markets outside of New York City.
 
Products and Services
 
Digital Taxi Top Advertising – We operate 300 full-motion 45” double-sided digital displays. The displays are 10 times brighter than a typical HD television for high visibility day and night. Our content management software allows for geo-targeting of advertising to specific neighborhoods, retail areas and airports.

Traditional Taxi Top Advertising – Our 14” by 48” panels are fully illuminated and provide millions of daily cost-effective advertising impressions for our customers.
 
Experiential Marketing – We are beginning expansion into experiential marketing, realizing the need for brands to not only reach consumers on a mass level but to create connections with consumers on a more personal level. We plan to do this by utilizing taxi assets and doing stagings and free rides, but also creating opportunities by building out locations. We also intend to create touch points for brands in vehicles that are not taxis, such as glass trucks, and utilize projection for brands to make huge impact around festivals such as CES, SXSW, Coachella, etc.
 
Markets
 
Strong Outdoor currently operates only in the New York City taxicab market. We may consider expanding into other major metropolitan areas after attaining profitability in our initial market. Our customers include advertisers of feature films, television programs, Broadway shows and various consumer products and services.
Competition
 
There are over 13,000 yellow taxicabs in the New York City market. Other media and taxicab service companies provide taxi-top advertising services for taxicabs not subject to our agreement. We also compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising.
Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations

This world class ISO certified operation has the capability of manufacturing multiple standard screens simultaneously to large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications.
Quality Control
 
We believe that our quality control procedures and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture, distribute or service have contributed significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. The inspection of incoming materials and components as well as the testing of all of our products during various stages of the sales and service cycle are key elements of this program.
Trademarks
 
We own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products. We believe our success will not be dependent upon trademark protection, but rather upon our scientific and engineering capabilities and research and production techniques. We consider the following trademarks to be of value to our business: Strong® and Convergent™.

We employed 294 persons at December 31, 2018, substantially all of which were full-time.

Regulation
 
We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health requirements; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.
 
Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.
