Industry Trends for NSE 
The telecommunications industry is experiencing a major evolution in technology as wireless communications expand and evolve from 4G to 5G technology. 5G’s increased bandwidth capacity and speed, as well as lower latency will expand applications beyond mobile devices. 5G is expected to enable numerous use cases including greater device-to-device connectivity, smart applications, autonomous cars, factory automation and other applications that are yet to be conceptualized. The increase in demand for openness and scalability in the 5G Radio Access Network is motivating the push towards O-RAN standards and ecosystems. O-RAN will eventually improve the time-to-market for new verticals and innovations as well as reduce the total cost of ownership. The 5G transition is being deployed globally and is expected to be disruptive to businesses, consumers and potentially create new applications and vertical industries. 
The increase in demand for 5G services will be increasingly supported by automation and associated artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will further enable enterprise requirements for private 5G as well as numerous use cases such as remote working and energy efficiency. Such increases in demand of pervasive on-premise/off-premise services will further drive the need for cybersecurity. Further adoption of 5G will require optical fiber upgrades and buildouts driven by traditional CSPs as well as enterprise networks. Hyperscale service providers have become significant drivers of technology innovation, including optical fiber up to 800GbE. The scale and complexity of these technology shifts are also challenging service providers to rearchitect their networks, becoming more virtualized, and optimized based on real-time intelligence. We believe these investments will extend fiber connectivity beyond the office and home and permeate “fiber-to-the-everywhere” leading to potential new business opportunities for VIAVI. 
Existing network infrastructure that is not otherwise being upgraded is also expected to be modernized with new cable and access technologies. Cable providers are investing in DOCSIS 3.1 to enhance existing cable networks while DSL copper lines are being upgraded to GFast. Many operators have decided to run existing legacy networks by deploying superior technologies or continue to run until they are no longer operable and then replace them with new optical fiber. For our avionics products, many governments across the globe are increasing their military and public safety budgets to upgrade communication infrastructure.

Manufacturing 
As of July 2, 2022, we have significant manufacturing facilities for our NE, SE and OSP segments located in China, France, Germany, Mexico, United Kingdom and the United States. Our most significant contract manufacturing partners are located in China and Mexico. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although we intend to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable intellectual property cross-licensing agreements. As of July 2, 2022, we own 890 U.S. patents and 1,607 foreign patents and have 1,090 patent applications pending throughout the world. The average age of the patents we hold is 8.9 years, which is younger than the midpoint of the average 20-year life of a patent. 
Backlog
Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period. 
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, as is typical for our competitors and many large companies. For NSE, revenue is typically higher in the second and fourth fiscal quarter, all else being equal. There is typically a modest end of calendar year customer spending budget that benefits our second fiscal quarter. Telecom and cable spending budgets are typically set at the start of a new calendar year, thus with all else being equal, our third fiscal quarter is NSE’s weakest revenue quarter with spending release benefiting our fourth fiscal quarter. 
For our OSP business, given our exposure to the consumer market, namely our 3D sensing products into the smart phone market, OSP revenue is expected to be seasonally higher in the first and second fiscal quarter followed by seasonal demand declines in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
