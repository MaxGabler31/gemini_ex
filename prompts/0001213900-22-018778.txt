Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering, we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns.



On November 3, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 7,500,000 units (the “units”). Each unit consists of one ordinary share of our company, and one redeemable warrant of our company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to our company of $75,000,000. 



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 3,750,000 private warrants to our sponsor and the underwriters of the initial public offering at a purchase price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating gross proceeds of $3,750,000. Effective December 10, 2020, by agreement between our sponsor and the underwriters, an aggregate of 375,000 private warrants were assigned by the underwriters to our sponsor.



A total of $75,750,000, comprised of $72,000,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and $3,750,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Morgan Stanley, N.A. (the “trust account”) maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Six unaffiliated qualified institutional buyers (who are also not affiliated with our sponsor or any member of our management team) purchased units in our initial public offering at a level of 9.9% of the units sold in the initial public offering (which aggregated to 59.4% of the units sold in the initial public offering) and entered into subscription agreements with the sponsor to memorialize their agreement. We refer to these investors as “anchor investors.” In consideration of providing these agreements, the anchor investors each purchased membership interests in our sponsor, for nominal consideration, entitling them to an interest in an aggregate of 270,000 founder shares held by our sponsor or 45,000 founder shares for each anchor investor (which we refer to as the “anchor founder shares”). The anchor founder shares are treated the same in all material respects as the founder shares held by our sponsor, except such anchor founder shares shall have the right not to be subject to adjustments or cutbacks in the event our sponsor agrees to any such adjustments or cutbacks (of its shares) in connection with our initial business combination. Discussions with each anchor investor were separate and the arrangements with them are not contingent on each other. Further, to our knowledge, the anchor investors are not affiliated with each other and are not acting together with regards to our company. Pursuant to the subscription agreements with our sponsor, the anchor investors have not been granted any material additional shareholder or other rights, and were only issued membership interests in our sponsor with no right to control our sponsor or vote or dispose of the anchor founder shares (which will continue to be held by our sponsor until following our initial business combination). Further, the anchor investors are not required to: (i) hold any units, ordinary shares or warrants they may have purchased in the initial public offering or thereafter for any amount time, (ii) vote any ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of our initial business combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their ordinary shares at the time of the initial business combination. The purchases by the anchor investors of units in our initial public offering or our securities in the open market (or both) could, if they hold such securities, allow the anchor investors or any one of them to assert influence over our company, including with respect to our initial business combination or any other actions our sponsor may take (including, for example, our pending proposal to extend the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination).



It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Robert Striar, our Chief Executive Officer, and Christopher Calise, our Chief Financial Officer (each of whom are also directors of our company), who have many years of experience in the sports, entertainment, financial and insurance industries. We must complete our initial business combination by May 3, 2022, which is 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (which date is subject to possible extension as described below). If our initial business combination is not consummated by May 3, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



On April 5, 2022, we filed a definitive proxy statement to announce our intention to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on April 26, 2022 to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination on a month to month basis (subject to additional monies being funded into our trust account by our sponsor or its designees as described in such definitive proxy statement) from May 3, 2022 up until November 3, 2022. Such an extension requires the approval of our public shareholders to amend our charter, who will be provided the opportunity to at the time of the special meeting to redeem all or a portion their ordinary shares. A significant number of such redemptions will have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and other adverse effects on our company, such as our ability to have enough cash to implement an initial business combination or to maintain our listing on Nasdaq. In connection with such special meeting of shareholders, we may engage in negotiations and enter into transactions with certain (as of yet unidentified) shareholders of our company with regard to transactions under which our sponsor would assign founder shares to such shareholders in consideration of their voting in favor of the extension and not redeeming their holdings in our company in connection therewith. Additionally, our sponsor may also separately explore transactions under which it would sell its interest in our company to another management team.

Our Business



While our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry, sector or region, since our initial public offering, we have sought to capitalize on the expertise of our management team in the sports (including sports franchises or assets related to sports franchises, and sports technology), entertainment and brands sectors. Our business combination focus is on leading sports, entertainment and brand companies that have potential for brand and commercial growth.



Our objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our shareholders by applying our strategy of identifying opportunities and capitalizing on the experience of our management team to acquire and manage a business that can benefit from our management team’s global experience with teams, leagues, brands and investments. Our approach is focused on industries or sectors in which our management team has considerable knowledge and emphasizes downside protection and the preservation of capital by opportunistically pursuing transactions where we believe we have the ability to make an economic impact that drives revenue growth.



Business Strategy



Professional sports leagues and teams and their brands are widely recognized with an economic reach that goes far beyond the field and city of play. For example, in the United States, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, the National Basketball League, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, and their teams, have been transformed into economic platforms by implementing business practices and operations to optimize profit across a variety of platforms. Professional teams have established comprehensive commercial practices for strategy, marketing, branding, licensing and sponsorship, and have diversified the revenue streams to include real estate and content development, in addition to the more traditional revenue streams like advertising dollars, sponsorship revenues, royalties, ticket sales and endorsements. Additionally, league organizations have created structured, rule-driven platforms to ensure compliance with best practices and the maintenance of league brand value. This ability to manage a professional sports team as a business has taken sports teams and brands from localized support to global fandoms with worldwide revenue bases, and has in turn made sports properties very low risk, secure asset classes that should accrete in value, regardless of the on-field success of the sports franchise.



In addition to changes in revenue streams and marketing and licensing practices, the sports media landscape is evolving in the way in which sports content is created and consumed. New distribution channels, including free-to-air broadcasters, digital channels with native content, unofficial live streams and pure OTT offerings, are increasing their reach positioning the media space for further disruption. Further, new types of sports content including live video content, fan-generated content, sponsor-generated content and digital audio content has transformed the way the public interacts with sports franchises. This proliferation of new consumption channels and content offers high-growth opportunities. Additionally, the global e-sports market has grown, and is expecting to generate a revenue of $1.5 billion in 2020. This, along with newly legalized betting markets across the States, has brought large new audiences to the sports media markets, and has created opportunities for new marketing and broadcasting revenue streams.



Team management and success in Europe and North America are varied among the leagues with diverse levels of development in commercial practices. For example, the market for sports media and digital rights in America has grown more significantly than in Europe. As more teams understand the necessity of building global brands in order to compete for revenue and brand recognition across fan bases, advanced departments, experiences and expertise are required to enhance visibility and profitability. We believe that our management team can provide this.



With a process focused on commercial success and profit both on and off the field, our management team has experience developing marketing and licensing programs for teams, brands and other sports or entertainment companies that extend such company’s brand and economics. Our team brings specific managerial and brand experience in assisting teams in achieving their global business goals. Our management team’s sector expertise centers around Mr. Striar, who has advised sports federations, leagues, teams and commercial partners on how to elevate their brands, manage business units and improve the areas of strategy, marketing and revenue. He has directly worked on five CONCACAF Gold Cups, the development of the CONCACAF Champions League and certain teams therein, the NHL Winter Classic, NHL China and the World Cup of Hockey. Mr. Striar’s work has merged the strategic goals of the sports business with the execution of comprehensive programs that have driven sponsorship, ticket sales, attendance and licensing.



Our investment thesis and competitive edge is grounded in the following three pillars: 




● | Sports properties are very secure assets that typically increase in value, especially in certain pockets with attractive fundamentals and more opportunity for growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our management team has a demonstrated track record of successful value creation with sports-oriented assets and also has access to proprietary opportunities that can be leveraged to drive value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The owner-friendly architecture of SPACs limit sponsorship dilution and gives investors access to exclusive deals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is identifying, acquiring and, after our initial business combination, building a company in the public market. We are seeking a company in the sports and entertainment industries that complements the experience and operational expertise of our management team and is a business that we think our management team’s experience and operational expertise can help improve. Our selection process leverages our team’s network of industry relationships, managerial expertise, private banking and investment opportunities and unique industry specific expertise which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities.



In addition, we utilize the established global relationships and industry experience of our directors in seeking an initial business combination. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities.



This group has experience in:




● | Operating companies, implementing and executing growth strategies and cost saving initiatives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic transactions, and expanding the product range;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managing global brands and sports entities;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Providing strategic guidance to develop revenue and commercial opportunities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identifying, mentoring and recruiting world-class talent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.



We are seeking to acquire companies, brands and/or teams that we believe meet certain of the following criteria:




● | Enterprise values of between $300 million and $900 million;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our management team;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have attractive growth prospects;
--+----------------------------------


● | Have a competitive advantage;
--+------------------------------


● | Have an identifiable revenue of over $100 million;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Exhibit industry leadership; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Exhibit potential for global expansion in sports, sponsorship and brand recognition;


● | Would benefit from a public acquisition currency; or ownership would benefit from liquidity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate attractive valuation;
--+----------------------------------


● | Demonstrate potential for free cash flow generation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Have secondary potential revenue streams.
--+------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our initial business combination consistent with our business objectives. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.

Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets



We believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous acquisition candidates available. Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses are brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings that did not commence until after the completion of our initial public offering. These sources introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting.



Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. While we have not engaged and do not anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm, or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.



If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.



Our officers have agreed not to become involved with another publicly listed blank check company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act prior to us announcing an agreement for our initial business combination, or the expiration of the period for us to announce and/or complete our initial business combination.



Status as a Publicly Listed Company



We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.

Strong Financial Position and Flexibility



With a trust account initially in the amount of $75,758,781, as of December 31, 2021, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. This amount assumes no redemptions (in connection with shareholder votes on either, or both, of the proposal to approval our initial business combination or the pending proposal to amend our charter to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination), and includes up to $2,250,000 of deferred underwriting fees, subject to adjustment as described elsewhere herein. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we will likely need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. As we have explored business combination possibilities, we have also explored potential third party financing, although as of the date of this report we have no binding commitments for any third party or other financing. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints.



Effecting our initial business combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We will effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private warrants, our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts raised in our initial public offering and held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the rules of Nasdaq, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any legally binding arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.





5







In evaluating a prospective target business, we have conducted and will continue to conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we have engaged or may engage in the future.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination have been significant and are expected to continue to be significant. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses



So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, the target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, if we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities (although our memorandum and articles of association will provide that we may not issue securities that can vote with ordinary shareholders on matters related to our pre-initial business combination activity). If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act. Even though we will own a majority interest in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders.





6







Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the Companies Act for each such transaction.

Type of Transaction | Whether Shareholder Approval is Required 
---------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 
Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control | No 




Additionally, under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






7







We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as adopting an incentive stock plan or amending our memorandum and articles of association. So long as we maintain a listing of our securities on Nasdaq, we are required to comply with such rules.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination or In Connection with a Business Combination Deadline Extension Proposal



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially $10.10 per share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.



On April 5, 2022, we filed a definitive proxy statement to announce our intention to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on April 26, 2022 to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination on a month to month basis (subject to additional monies being funded into our trust account by our sponsor or its designees as described in such definitive proxy statement) from May 3, 2022 up until November 3, 2022. Such an extension requires the approval of our public shareholders to amend our charter, who will be provided the opportunity to at the time of the special meeting to redeem all or a portion their ordinary shares in the manner described above with respect to our initial business combination. A significant number of such redemptions will have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and other adverse effects on our company, such as our ability to have enough cash to implement an initial business combination or to maintain our listing on Nasdaq. In connection with such special meeting of shareholders, we may engage in negotiations and enter into transactions with certain (as of yet unidentified) shareholders of our company with regard to transactions under which our sponsor would assign founder shares to such shareholders in consideration of their voting in favor of the extension and not redeeming their holdings in our company in connection therewith.




Additionally, our sponsor may also separately explore transactions under which it would sell its interest in our company to another management team.



Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.



We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 2,812,501 of the 7,500,000 public shares, or approximately 37.5%, sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming they do not purchase shares in the open market). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, if one or more of the anchor investors hold a significant number of ordinary shares at the time of the business combination, they could have significant influence over the outcome of our business combination process. One or more of the anchor investors could also have significant influence over the outcome of our pending proposal to amend our charter to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination.



We will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote in conjunction with our initial business combination for business or other legal reasons (so long as shareholder approval is not required by the Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will:




● | offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.



In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.



When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.



Limitation on Redemption Rights upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval.



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares, or 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court.

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities by Our Affiliates



If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.



The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.



Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights



We require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.





10







The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until May 3, 2022, which is 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. On April 5, 2022, we filed a definitive proxy statement to announce our intention to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on April 26, 2022 to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination on a month to month basis (subject to additional monies being funded into our trust account by our sponsor or its designees as described in such definitive proxy statement) from May 3, 2022 up until November 3, 2022. No assurances can be given that the proposal to extend our business combination deadline will be approved.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination by May 3, 2022, which is 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. On April 5, 2022, we filed a definitive proxy statement to announce our intention to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on April 26, 2022 to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination on a month to month basis (subject to additional monies being funded into our trust account by our sponsor or its designees as described in such definitive proxy statement) from May 3, 2022 up until November 3, 2022.



We have yet to find, and may not be able to find, a suitable target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by May 3, 2022 (as such date may be extended with the approval of our shareholders), we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.



Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and file notice with the Registrar that the liquidation is complete. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.





11







Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our initial public offering.



However, if our initial shareholders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquired or will acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by May 3, 2022 (as such date may be extended with the approval of our shareholders). We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account or interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.



Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00 (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00, plus interest (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses).



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.00 per share.



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $1,000,000 not placed in the trust with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. Offering costs amounted to $493,264 and cash of $997,780 was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for working capital purposes.



If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.




12







Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by May 3, 2022 (as such date may be extended with the approval of our shareholders), (ii) if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by May 3, 2022 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity (including the pending shareholder vote to extend our business combination deadline as described below). In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.



On April 5, 2022, we filed a definitive proxy statement to announce our intention to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on April 26, 2022 to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination on a month to month basis (subject to additional monies being funded into our trust account by our sponsor or its designees as described in such definitive proxy statement) from May 3, 2022 up until November 3, 2022. Such an extension requires the approval of our public shareholders to amend our charter, who will be provided the opportunity to at the time of the special meeting to redeem all or a portion their ordinary shares. A significant number of such redemptions will have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and other adverse effects on our company, such as our ability to have enough cash to implement an initial business combination or to maintain our listing on Nasdaq. In connection with such special meeting of shareholders, we may engage in negotiations and enter into transactions with certain (as of yet unidentified) shareholders of our company with regard to transactions under which our sponsor would assign founder shares to such shareholders in consideration of their voting in favor of the extension and not redeeming their holdings in our company in connection therewith. No assurances can be given that the proposal to extend our business combination deadline will be approved.



Additionally, our sponsor may also separately explore transactions under which it would sell its interest in our company to another management team.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses are limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, and our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they are devoting as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not have and do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Our units, ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business of our initial business combination as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination within our 18 month time frame.




13







We are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) ending after November 3, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
