  General
  
 Insignia Systems, Inc. (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “Insignia,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”) markets in-store advertising products, programs and services to retailers and consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) manufacturers. The Company was incorporated in 1990. Since 1998, the Company has focused on managing a retail network, made up of over 21,000 store locations, for the primary purpose of providing turn-key at-shelf market access for CPG manufacturers’ marketing programs. Insignia provides participating retailers with benefits including incremental revenue, incremental sales opportunities, increased shopper engagement in-store, and custom creative development and other in-kind services.
  
 Insignia’s primary product has been the Point-Of-Purchase Services (POPS®) in-store marketing program. Insignia POPS® program is a national, account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. Internal testing has indicated the program delivers incremental sales for the featured brand. The program allows manufacturers to deliver vital product information to consumers at the point-of-purchase, and to leverage the local retailer brand and store-specific prices to provide a unique “call to action” that draws attention to the featured brand and triggers a purchase decision. CPG customers benefit from Insignia’s nimble operational capabilities, which include short lead times, in-house graphic design capabilities, post-program analytics, and micro-marketing capabilities such as variable or bilingual messaging.
  
 The Company discontinued the sale of The Like MachineTM (TLM) upon the expiration of its distribution agreement on March 31, 2017. The Company had not received significant revenue from this offering at the time sales were discontinued. Restructuring costs incurred and paid in 2017 were not significant.
  
 In October 2017, the Company announced the nationwide launch of freshADSsm, an exclusive advertising vehicle featured in produce, created to inspire shoppers early in their trip and help navigate them to center store.

  Industry and Market Background
  
 In-store grocery shopping remains prevalent and these shoppers are frequently making many of their purchase decisions at the shelf. As a result, consumer product manufacturers are seeking access to in-store marketing vehicles that drive awareness, prompt consideration and encourage shoppers to buy their brand in this critical retail environment. Insignia is usually engaged as part of an overall, mixed-media, brand marketing campaign. Our programs offer manufacturers the unique features not available to other marketing services providers that help their brands “close the sale” at the point of purchase and across other areas of the in-store retail environment.

  Insignia’s POPSign Program and Brand-Equity Signage
  Insignia’s POPSign program is an in-store, shelf-edge, point-of-purchase advertising and promotion tactic designed to assist CPG manufacturers in achieving marketing objectives. Depending on the design and format, Insignia POPSigns can deliver information from manufacturers such as product uses and features, nutritional information, advertising taglines, product images, or usage photos. The differentiating feature of Insignia POPSigns is that store-specific prices from the retailer, and each retailer’s unique logo, are combined on the sign. Signs are installed in close proximity to the manufacturer’s product in participating stores, and are maintained in two-week cycle increments.

  In addition to POPSigns, Insignia offers a brand-equity signage program (without featured price or retailer logo) in a subset of managed retailers. This program offers CPG manufacturers expanded market access for their advertising objectives.
  
 Manufacturers pay program rates based upon the directed number of cycles and retailer/store count. The Company collects and organizes data from the manufacturer as well as the participating retailers, designs and prints the signage, and delivers signage. Depending on the agreement with the retailer, either a third-party professional installer or store personnel use placement instructions to install the correct signage at the shelf during the correct timeframe.
  
 The Company announced the nationwide launch of freshADSsm, an exclusive advertising vehicle featured in produce, created to inspire shoppers early in their trip and help navigate them to center store.
 
  Legacy Products
  Insignia offers custom design, printing and store signage programs directly to retailers that seek effective ways to communicate with their shoppers in store. Legacy products include adhesive and non-adhesive supplies in a variety of colors, sizes and weights. Custom signage and cardstock is sold by the Company in a variety of sizes and colors that can be customized to include pre-printed custom artwork, such as a retailer’s logo. Approximately 6% of our 2017 revenues came from the sale of these legacy products. The Company expects this percentage to be down in 2018.
 Marketing and Sales
  
 The Company primarily markets and sells its programs to CPG manufacturers through a direct sales force. Insignia has direct relationships with many of the top 100 CPG manufacturers. Marketing support includes customized sales pitches, selling tools such as rich media presentations, and online marketing efforts. The Company also maintains direct relationships with retailers in its retail distribution network, through a direct field force as well as an in-house support team that helps enable our program at retail.
  
 The participating retailer network is managed and maintained through direct relationships, and also through contracts with Valassis Sales and Marketing Services, Inc. (Valassis) and News America Marketing In-Store, LLC (News America).
  
 During 2017 and 2016, foreign sales accounted for less than 1% of total net sales each year. The Company expects sales to foreign distributors will remain less than 1% of total net sales in 2018.
  
  Competition
  
 The Insignia POPSign program provided approximately 92% of the Company’s total net sales for 2017. The POPSign program faces intense competition for the marketing expenditures of consumer product manufacturers for at-shelf advertising-related signage. In particular, the Company faces significant competition from News America, which also provides at-shelf advertising and promotional signage. Although the settlement of prior litigation with News America resulted in a 10-year agreement through February 2021 that provides the Company with additional opportunities to compete by offering signs with price in specific parts of News America’s retail network, the Company will continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America’s other at-shelf advertising and other promotional signage offerings, as well as with other companies that offer digital advertising alternatives, including digital and other in-store displays.
  
 The Company believes the main strengths of the Insignia POPSign program in relation to its competitors are:
 
   ●
 Depending on manufacturer’s objectives, benefits to the brand that range from sales lift, awareness building, program ROI, new tier generation, or support of retailer programs;

   ●
 Managing and providing turn-key access to a national network of retailers in support of objectives listed above; including smaller regional or independent retailers, which tend to be under-served by our competitors and difficult to aggregate at the national level;

   ●
 Variable messaging capabilities including bi-lingual targeting; and

   ●
 Shorter lead times on program execution.
