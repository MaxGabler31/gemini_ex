Our Company
 
Our Company began in 1945 under the name Dixie Supply Company in Florence, Alabama.  Although we initially specialized primarily in the marine and small aircraft business, by 1960, we were solely in the sporting goods business.  In 1965, we opened our second store, Dyess & Hibbett Sporting Goods, in Huntsville, Alabama, and hired Mickey Newsome, who is now Chairman of our Board.  The following year, we opened another sporting goods store in Birmingham and by the end of 1980, we had 12 stores in central and northwest Alabama with a distribution center located in Birmingham and our central accounting office in Florence.  We became a public company in October 1996.
 
Today, we are a leading athletic-inspired omni-channel retailer operating stores primarily located in small and mid-sized communities, and an e-commerce website under Hibbett.com.  As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,079 stores consisting of 1,060 Hibbett Sports stores and 19 smaller-format Sports Additions athletic shoe stores in 35 states.  The Hibbett Sports store is an approximately 5,000 square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are frequently influenced by a major chain retailer such as a Wal-Mart store.
 
Our current primary merchandising strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and athletic equipment at competitive prices in a conveniently located full-service environment.  At the end of the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we successfully launched our e-commerce website.  We will continue to grow our online business aggressively, while continuing to enhance our stores to improve the overall customer experience.  We believe that the breadth and depth of our brand name merchandise consistently exceeds the product selection carried by most of our competitors, particularly in our smaller markets.  Many of these brand name products are highly technical and require expert sales assistance.  We continuously educate our sales staff on new products and trends through coordinated efforts with our vendors.
Our Executive Officers
 
Our current executive officers and their prior business experience are as follows:
 
Jeffry O. Rosenthal, age 60, has been our Chief Executive Officer and President since March 2010.  He also currently serves on our Board of Directors.  Formerly, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer from February 2009 through March 2010 and as Vice President of Merchandising from August 1998 through February 2009.  Prior to joining us, Mr. Rosenthal was Vice President and Divisional Merchandise Manager for Apparel with Champs Sports, a division of Foot Locker, Inc., from 1981 to 1998.
Scott J. Bowman, age 51, was hired as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in July 2012.  Prior to joining us, Mr. Bowman was Division Chief Financial Officer – Northern Division of The Home Depot, a large home improvement retailer.  Previously, Mr. Bowman served The Home Depot as their Senior Director, Finance – IT for approximately three years.  In prior retail experience, he has worked in various controller and accounting management positions.

Jared S. Briskin, age 45, was appointed our Senior Vice President and Chief Merchant in September 2014.  Formerly, he served as Vice President/Divisional Merchandise Manager of Footwear and Equipment from March 2010 through September 2014 and Vice President/Divisional Merchandise Manager of Apparel and Equipment from June 2004 through March 2010.  Prior to his appointment to Vice President in 2004, Mr. Briskin held various merchandising positions across multiple categories since joining the Company in April 1998.
Cathy E. Pryor, age 54, has been our Senior Vice President of Operations since 2012.  Formerly, she served as Vice President of Operations from 1995 to 2012.  She joined our Company in 1988 serving in areas of increasing responsibility including district manager and Director of Store Operations.
Our Employees
 
As of February 3, 2018, we employed approximately 9,200 employees, of which approximately 3,100 are full-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  The number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on seasonal needs.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.  We have implemented programs in our stores and corporate offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified employees in a non-discriminatory way.
Employee Development:  We develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and employees.  These programs include DVD training in all stores for the latest in technical detail of new products and new operational and customer service techniques.  Because we primarily promote or relocate current employees to serve as managers for new stores, training and assessment of our employees is essential to our sustained growth.
 
One of the most significant training programs we have is Hibbett University or "Hibbett U", which is an intensive, five-day session designed specifically for store management.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We target small to mid-sized markets with branded products and provide a high level of customer service.  This market strategy enables us to achieve significant cost benefits including lower corporate expenses, reduced logistics costs and increased economies of scale from marketing activities.  We use information systems to maintain tight controls over inventory and operating costs and continually search for ways to improve efficiencies and the customer experience through information system upgrades.  In addition, we establish greater customer, vendor and landlord recognition as a leading athletic specialty retailer in these communities.  We believe our ability to align our merchandising mix to local preferences and trends differentiates us from our national competitors.
 
We strive to hire enthusiastic sales people with an interest in sports.  Our extensive training program focuses on product knowledge and selling skills and is conducted through the use of in-store clinics, interactive group discussions and store associate training, self-study courses and Hibbett University designed specifically for store management.
 
Our Store Concepts
 
Hibbett Sports:  Our primary retail format is Hibbett Sports, an approximately 5,000 square foot store located primarily in strip centers, which are usually near a major chain retailer such as a Wal-Mart store.  In considering locations for our Hibbett Sports stores, we take into account the size, demographics, quality of real estate and competitive conditions in each market.  Of these stores, 864 Hibbett Sports stores are located in strip centers, which include free-standing stores, with the remaining 196 stores located in enclosed malls, the majority of which are the only enclosed malls in their county.
 
Hibbett Sports stores offer a core merchandising mix of localized footwear, apparel, accessories and equipment designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market.  We strive to respond quickly to major sporting events such as Bowl or National Championship games and similar sporting events in college or professional football, baseball and basketball involving teams of local interest within our markets.
  - 6 -
 
    Sports Additions:  We operate 19 Sports Additions (SA) stores, an approximately 2,500 square foot store located primarily in enclosed malls.  Approximately 90% of the merchandise carried in our SA stores is athletic footwear with the remainder consisting of caps and a limited assortment of apparel.  SA stores offer a more fashion-based merchandise assortment compared to our Hibbett Sports stores.  Most of our SA stores are located where a Hibbett Sports store is also present.
Team:  In December 2017, we sold a portion of the assets and ceased the operations of Hibbett Team Sales, Inc. (Team), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Team was a supplier of customized athletic apparel, equipment and footwear primarily to school athletic programs in Alabama and parts of Georgia, Florida and Mississippi.  Team sold its merchandise directly to educational institutions and youth associations.  The operations of Team were independent of the operations of our retail stores.
 
None of our store concepts meets the quantitative or qualitative requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We identify markets for our Hibbett Sports stores under a clustered expansion program.  This approach primarily focuses on opening new stores within a two-hour driving distance of an existing Hibbett location, allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies in logistics, marketing and regional management.  It also aids us in building a better understanding of appropriate merchandise selection for the local market.  In addition to proximity to existing Hibbett stores, we also consider population, economic conditions, local competitive dynamics, availability of suitable real estate and potential for return on investment when evaluating potential markets.
 
Omni-channel strategy:  We recognize that our customer is evolving and looking to engage with us in multiple ways.  As a result, we continue to make investments that will enable us to engage our customer specifically in the digital commerce channel.  In addition to having store-to-store and store-to-home capability allowing us to use our chain-wide inventory to satisfy a customer sale, we now have an e-commerce website allowing customers to shop across both channels.  In Fiscal 2018, we began development of our mobile app, which will complement our mobile site and provide our customers with even more advanced features such as shopping, loyalty and Raffle capabilities.  We expect to rollout our mobile app to both iPhone and Android users in the first half of Fiscal 2019.
 
Our Logistics
 
We maintain a single wholesale and logistics facility in Alabaster, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) where we receive and ship substantially all of our merchandise.  For key products, we maintain backstock at the facility that is allocated and shipped to stores through an automatic replenishment system based on inventory levels and sales.  Merchandise is typically delivered to stores weekly via Company-operated vehicles or third-party logistics providers.
 See "Risk Factors."
 
We believe strong logistics support for our stores is a critical element of our expansion strategy and is central to our ability to maintain a low cost operating structure.  We use third-party logistics providers to gain efficiencies to approximately 25% of our outlying stores.  Our wholesale and logistics facility is designed with significant automation and operational efficiencies.  We expect the facility will support our growth over the next several years.
Our Merchandise
 
Our merchandising strategy is to provide a broad assortment of premium brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and athletic equipment at competitive prices in a full service environment.

The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories:
 

 | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016
----------+-------------+------+-------------+------+------------
Footwear | | 55% | | 52% | | 49% 
Apparel | | 28% | | 29% | | 29% 
Equipment | | 17% | | 19% | | 22% 
 | | 100% | | 100% | | 100%

 
We believe that the assortment of brand name merchandise we offer consistently exceeds the merchandise selection carried by most of our brick and mortar competitors, particularly in our smaller markets.  Many of these brand name products have limited availability and/or are technical in nature requiring considerable sales assistance.  We coordinate with our vendors to educate the sales staff at the store level on new products and trends.
 
Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each Hibbett store, important demographic, local and/or regional differences exist.  Accordingly, our stores offer products that reflect preferences for particular demographics as well as interests from each community.  Our knowledge of these interests, combined with access to leading vendors, enables our merchandising staff to react quickly to emerging trends or special events, such as fashion shifts or athletic events.
 
Our merchandising staff, operations staff and management analyze current trends primarily through the lens of our store typing strategy.  This information is gathered and analyzed utilizing our business intelligence tool.  Other strategic measures we utilize to recognize trends or changes in our industry include:
 
 
· | maintaining close relationships with vendors and other retailers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | studying other retailers for best practices in merchandising;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | attending various trade shows, both in our industry and outside as well as reviewing industry trade publications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | actively participating in industry associations such as the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | visiting competitor store locations;
--+-------------------------------------


· | monitoring industry data sources and periodicals;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | monitoring product selection at competing stores and online; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | communicating with our regional vice presidents, district managers and store managers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The merchandising staff works closely with store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities.  See "Risk Factors."
 
Our Vendor Relationships
 
The athletic specialty retail business is brand name driven.  Accordingly, we maintain positive relationships with a number of well-known vendors to satisfy customer demand.  We believe that our stores are among the primary brick and mortar retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to penetrate our target markets.  As a result, we are able to attract considerable vendor interest and establish long-term partnerships with vendors.  As our vendors expand their product lines and grow in popularity, we expand sales of these products within our stores.  In addition, as we continue to increase our store base and enter new markets, our vendors increase their brand presence within these regions.  We also work with our vendors to establish favorable pricing and to receive cooperative marketing funds.  See "Risk Factors."
Our Information Systems
 
We continue to use technology as an enabler of our business strategies.  We have implemented and maintained systems targeted at improving financial control, cost management, inventory control, merchandise planning, logistics, replenishment, and product allocation.  In recent years, we have focused on information systems that are designed to be used in all stores, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each specific store location.  In Fiscal 2018, we added our digital channel as we continue our omni-channel retailing transition.  In Fiscal 2019, we will pursue further channel integration and a more seamless and frictionless set of capabilities aimed at enhancing our customers shopping experience in store, online and through our mobile solutions.

Our communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from our stores, our third party cloud providers, and our managed hosting facility (primary data center).  Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets.  We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyber-security threats and business interruptions by maintaining strong security protocols, threat monitoring, regular risk reviews, and a detailed disaster recovery plan.
 
We strive to maintain highly qualified and motivated teams of individuals to support our information systems, which includes security, help desk, engineering, operations, quality assurance, business analysis, solution development and project managers.  Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day.  Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will continue to support our current needs and future growth.  We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning and enterprise risk management.  Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business criteria.
 
Our Marketing and Promotion
 
We target marketing opportunities to increase awareness and to drive traffic to our stores and website.  Direct mail continued to be a core component of our marketing budget in Fiscal 2018, and we began significant investments in digital marketing with the launch of ecommerce.  Because these investments are yielding strong response, we will continue to grow digital marketing in Fiscal 2019.  We utilize the Hibbett marketing team, as well as external digital marketing agencies to ensure execution and returns from these new programs.
 
We offer a customer loyalty program, the Hibbett Rewards program, whereby customers can earn awards that can be redeemed in our stores.  Our Rewards program represents a significant portion of overall sales.  In Fiscal 2018, we launched an improved program that provides more value to our customers and makes it easier to use.  As a result, we significantly increased our member base in Fiscal 2018, which we will utilize in our marketing efforts going forward.  We expect to further improve our Rewards program in Fiscal 2019 to drive member acquisition and sales. 
 
Our Competition
 
The business in which we are engaged is highly competitive.  The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies.  We compete with department and discount stores, traditional shoe stores, specialty sporting goods shops, local sporting goods stores, outlet centers, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and, in some of our large and mid-size markets, national sporting goods superstores.  In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers.
 
Although we face competition from a variety of competitors, we believe that our stores are able to compete effectively by providing a premium assortment of footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment.  Additionally, we differentiate our store experience through extensive product knowledge, customer service and convenient locations.  We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors in the smaller markets predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.  See "Risk Factors."
 
Our Trademarks
 
Our Company, by and through subsidiaries, is the owner or licensee of trademarks that are very important to our business.  For the most part, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.
 
Following is a list of active trademarks registered and owned by the Company:
 
 
· | Hibbett Sports, Registration No. 2717584
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Sports Additions, Registration No. 1767761
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Hibbett, Registration No. 3275037
--+----------------------------------

Seasonality
 
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations.  We typically experience higher net sales in early spring due to spring sports and annual tax refunds, late summer due to back-to-school shopping and winter due to holiday shopping.  In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new store openings, the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores, weather fluctuations, merchandise mix, demand for merchandise driven by local interest in sporting events, and the timing of sales tax holidays and annual tax refunds.
 
Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that, historically, inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations as we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.
