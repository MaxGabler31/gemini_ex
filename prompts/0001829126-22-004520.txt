Overview
 
Hestia Insight Inc. (“Hestia”, “Hestia Insight”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2003, under the name Luxshmi Investments, Inc. (“Luxshmi Investments”), until the Company changed its name to Hestia Insight Inc. on March 27, 2019. On March 12, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation authorizing 300,000,000 shares of capital stock, comprised of 290,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”). On March 27, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (i) effecting a name change from Luxshmi Investments, Inc. to Hestia Insight Inc., and (ii) effecting a 50-to-1 reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split did not impact the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or its par value. On May 16, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Hestia Investments Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Hestia Investments”), to exchange, on a 1-for-1 basis, 27,614,200 shares of the Company’s Common Stock in exchange for 27,614,200 shares of Hestia Investments which were owned by 100% of the then-shareholders of Hestia Investments (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Hestia Investments became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns no patents. We have not applied for or received patent protection in the US or any other country, and, as a result, there is a distinct risk that we will not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We consider our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, non-disclosure, and contractual safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
 
In our current consulting business, we compete with a number of advisory firms offering similar service including consulting and strategy firms; market research, data, benchmarking, and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care information technology firms; technology advisory firms; outsourcing firms; and specialized providers of advisory services. Other organizations, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, tools, and advisory services to health care organizations.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality and timeliness of our services, strength and depth of relationships with our clients, ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients, measurable returns on customer investment, and service and affordability.
 
As our business develops and we expand through joint ventures, acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the U.S., we will have competition with other direct service providers, emerging technologies and medical communication platforms. The Company will seek to maintain a competitive advantage through intellectual property, superior quality management and cutting-edge technology.
 
Government Regulation
 
The health care industry in the U.S. is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Further, the healthcare industry is currently undergoing rapid change. We are uncertain how, when or in what context these new changes will be adopted or implemented. These new regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients’ operations. Many of the laws are complex and their application to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have are not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and otherwise negatively affect our business. 
Employees
 
The Company has three employees. We otherwise rely on the services of independent contractors.
 
Our Offices
 
Our principal executive office is located at 400 S. 4th Street, Suite 500, Las Vegas, NV 89101.
