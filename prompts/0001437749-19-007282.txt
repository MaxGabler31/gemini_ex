OUR TARGET VERTICAL MARKETS
 
We focus our efforts on delivering mission-critical software solutions to enterprise customers in six core vertical markets within global manufacturing – automotive, life sciences, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology and industrial products. Within these vertical markets, we focus on 26 segments where many of our existing customers operate and our solutions are a strong product fit. We offer solutions designed to overcome the business challenges within each segment, based on our in-depth knowledge of the segment and best practices. In addition, we participate in industry groups serving our target segments to ensure that we address regulatory compliance issues, evaluate new manufacturing practices and leverage advanced technologies to give our customers a maximum competitive advantage.
Automotive: Automotive suppliers are a key focus for QAD.  Automotive suppliers must meet critical industry standards such as the Materials Management Operations Guideline/Logistics Evaluation (“MMOG/LE”) and International Automotive Task Force (“IATF”) 16949:2016 (previously ISO/TS 16949). Disruptions to the supply chain can cause significant financial impact. QAD’s automotive-specific processes and built-in industry best practices help automotive suppliers reduce costs, mitigate supply chain risk and improve supply chain planning and visibility. Our customer base includes companies serving the global automotive marketplace, especially the tier-1 suppliers in the supply chains of automotive original equipment manufacturers. We deliver unique capabilities to support the collaboration requirements of the automotive suppliers, including the strict quality requirements of Advanced Product Quality Process (“APQP”) and Production Part Approval Process (“PPAP”). Many of our customers use QAD Cloud EDI because it provides a scalable solution which standardizes Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) across their global enterprise. QAD Supplier Portal, which allows for electronic communication with other suppliers, is another product commonly used by our automotive customers. QAD solutions are in use at many of the market-leading automotive parts companies throughout the world that manufacture a broad range of components used in interiors, electrical components, safety systems, bodies and drivetrains.

Life Sciences: Life sciences manufacturers are dedicated to innovation, product quality and patient safety; however, a tightening regulatory environment, increasing cost pressures and greater supply chain complexities present challenges to the industry. Emerging markets, quality initiatives, and mergers and acquisitions activity also add to the complexity of life sciences manufacturing and distribution. QAD focuses on the following five segments in the life sciences industry: contract manufacturing; surgical devices; orthopedic devices; diagnostic devices; and pharmaceutical/biotechnology manufacturers. QAD solutions help global life sciences companies manufacture products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations and standards like ISO13485:2016 that are required by regulators around the world. In addition to cGMP, QAD solutions support many business and regulatory processes specific to the life sciences industry, such as automated quality management, supply chain planning and serialization in support of requirements for Unique Device Identification (“UDI”), the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”) and the Falsified Medicines Directive (“FMD”). QAD Cloud ERP for life sciences provides our customers with a qualified IT infrastructure as a key building block to help them ensure that they have a solid foundation for addressing life sciences regulatory requirements.
Consumer Products: Manufacturers of consumer products have the objective of delivering the right product, in the right quantities, to the right location at the right time to satisfy demand. To meet this goal, effective supply chain management is needed to synchronize critical activities and functions across the organization.  To gain market share and improve profitability, consumer products companies must anticipate and meet customer demand while managing their margins and complying with evolving safety and environmental regulations. QAD focuses on the following four segments in the consumer products industry: household and personal packaged products; consumer electronics; assembled and discrete products; and jewelry manufacturing. The manufacturing processes for these items vary and depend on the nature of the item; however, the fulfillment and distribution requirements have significant commonality. Major retailers manage complex supply chains and are typically very demanding of their suppliers as they strive to service growing demand from consumers for speed of delivery and variety of products. QAD solutions address the complex replenishment requirements of companies supplying the retail supply chain, including promotional pricing, demand planning, quality compliance and product configuration.
Food and Beverage: Food and beverage manufacturing is complex and requires regular updates to product, packaging and pricing. There is a lack of uniformity in the supply chain, which challenges food and beverage manufacturers to excel at supply chain management, as seasonal demand changes cause inefficiencies and increase manufacturing costs. At the same time, manufacturers must comply with requirements like field to fork traceability and record keeping. QAD focuses on the following six segments in the food and beverage industry: shelf-stable bottling, canning and packaging; distilleries, wineries and brewing; frozen foods; creameries and fresh foods; candy and confections; and meat and fish processing. Our solutions support regulatory and quality initiatives, such as the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) analysis, which address the management of biological, chemical and physical hazards. Our solutions support the product cycle of the food and beverage industry from raw material production, procurement and handling to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product.
High Technology: The success of manufacturers in the high technology industry relies on innovation and the ability to manage change. These manufacturers are subject to constant pressure on margins, challenges with cross border shipments, strains on material availability and cost control initiatives.  They require agile and effective global supply chains. All of these challenges need to be met while complying with standards and industry regulations. QAD solutions are used by many high-technology companies that manufacture a diverse range of products. QAD focuses on the following four segments in the high technology industry: standalone devices and test equipment; batteries, power supplies and lighting; cable, wiring and connectors; and industrial and high technology contract manufacturing. High-tech companies often face the challenges of very complex product structures with a need for traceability of parts and processes throughout their entire supply chain, as well as tight control of engineering changes. Many high-tech companies providing complex systems also face the challenge of managing installation and support of equipment after sale, in addition to managing field engineering resources. A high-technology manufacturer can use QAD’s solutions to configure product based on customers’ preference; manufacture and assemble product according to a customized specification; and schedule, install and support equipment throughout its lifecycle.

Industrial Products: Today’s global customers are demanding more configure-to-order, make-to-order, and assemble-to-order products. As a result, the modern, agile industrial manufacturer must be responsive to demands while managing tight margins, operational challenges and rapid changes to product features. QAD customers manufacture products as diverse as machine tools; specialist ceramic materials used in aerospace and defense; and equipment used in the oil and gas industries. Fluctuating demand leads to significant challenges in managing the internal supply chain, coordinating the extended vendor ecosystem, controlling costs, ensuring quality, tracking production, and optimizing inventory levels. Companies in this broad vertical market have requirements to maintain many manufacturing methodologies, often within the same enterprise. QAD focuses on the following six segments in the industrial products industry: flexible packaging; engineered materials; contract manufacturing; standalone equipment; remanufacturing; and roll stock and wire cable. Our solutions support multiple manufacturing methodologies in parallel, including lean manufacturing. The need for traceability of materials from source through to the finished product is often important to our customers, and QAD’s capabilities in traceability and serialization support this feature.
 
Our focus on these six vertical markets gives us a competitive advantage by providing a solution developed specifically for our target customers, without the complexity and distraction of functionality they don’t want and don’t need. While some vendors provide broader solutions built for many industries, our targeted vertical focus allows our customers to implement our solutions with fewer configurations and customizations than our competitors require, enabling less complex and faster implementations. We leverage our vertical market expertise in research and development to meet specific industry needs: in sales, to understand our customer’s unique requirements; in presales, to demonstrate how these requirements are handled in the software; and in services, to apply best practices in the optimization of business processes and the implementation of the software. Our options to sell our product in the cloud or as on-premises licenses enable customers operating in multiple locations to choose a deployment option that best meets their unique needs.
 
QAD SOLUTIONS
 
QAD products and services support the business processes of global manufacturing companies in our target industries. We continually monitor emerging business requirements and practices as well as regulatory changes and incorporate them into our product and solutions strategies. Our development focus emphasizes user experience. We strive to deliver solutions that offer comprehensive capabilities while being easy to access, learn and use.
 
The Channel Islands program was designed to transform the architecture and user experience of QAD solutions. Channel Islands has two key components: Channel Islands User Experience (“UX”) and the QAD Enterprise Platform.
 
The Channel Islands User Experience (“UX”) provides access to QAD Enterprise Applications on any device with a modern web browser. It includes a new user interface (“UI”) written in HTML5 which seamless access across desktops and mobile devices and has the ability to co-exist with our current .NET UI. Mobile devices continue to play an ever-increasing role in our day-to-day lives, and our customers are using mobile computing to support their businesses. Channel Islands leverages a responsive HTML5 user interface that displays appropriately across screen sizes. As such, Channel Islands is available on any device with a modern web browser, including tablets and smartphones.  In addition, QAD provides some mobile specific applications purpose-built for the actions users are likely to take on their mobile devices. These include a requisition approval solution, a mobile business intelligence solution, mobile browse capability and mobile application monitoring tools to support system administrators.
 
The QAD Enterprise Platform is the architecture behind the Channel Islands project. The benefits it provides to customers make it the most significant part of the solution. Manufacturers need an Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that will allow them to easily change their business processes to meet the demands of their changing market. The QAD Enterprise Platform provides five rapid response capabilities: Personalization; Embedded Analytics; Modularization; Extensibility; and New Apps. Most critically, these capabilities include the ability to extend current applications, to connect with external systems through micro services, and to develop entirely new applications on the QAD Enterprise Platform without the need to write or modify code in QAD Enterprise Applications. Extensions and new apps are non-intrusive to the enterprise applications and do not hinder future upgrades. Modularity provides the ability to upgrade the solution by components, rather than upgrading the entire solution at one time. This makes upgrades smaller, faster and easier; helping customers stay on the most current version of our software which reduces the gap between their business needs and what our enterprise applications provide. Modularity also allows us to improve the efficiency of our cloud operations using a simplified upgrade process. The architecture eases the adoption of new advanced technologies into the solution.

In support of our focus on business process efficiency, we have integrated the ability to generate business process maps for common business processes into our software using the QAD Process Editor tool. This tool simplifies implementations, maps common business processes and facilitates navigation throughout the entire product suite. Within our suite, we have embedded business process management (“QAD BPM”). QAD BPM allows customers to visualize their business processes; monitor transactional throughput by user, role or stage; and modify those processes to make them more efficient. Using QAD BPM, companies can create business process models, assign task responsibilities, and monitor and re-direct workflow; all of which reduce process execution time, improve visibility of active processes, identify bottlenecks and support process improvement. QAD developed its solutions to allow simple integration with other systems our customers use within their organizations. For example, we enable seamless integration between QAD Enterprise Applications, common browser applications and spreadsheets. QAD solutions also integrate easily with other web applications and web services. Using our Q-Xtend toolset, customers can connect to different software, even when remote, and they can use industry-standard middleware products such as the IBM MQ™ series or standard connectors built on the Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration platform. Robust Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) along with QAD Automation Solutions provide additional capabilities for integration.
 
QAD Cloud ERP and QAD Enterprise Applications
 
QAD Cloud ERP (delivered in the cloud) and QAD Enterprise Applications (delivered on-premises) are an integrated suite of software applications, which supports the core business processes of global manufacturing companies and provides specific functionality to support the requirements of our targeted industries and the geographies in which our customers conduct business. Both QAD Cloud ERP and QAD Enterprise Applications utilize the same underlying technology and therefore provide customers with the same functionality. QAD Cloud ERP and QAD Enterprise Applications allow customers to monitor, control and support their operations, whether operating a single plant or multiple sites located around the world.
 
QAD Cloud ERP provides customers with additional value and better experience than an on premises implementation.  QAD Cloud ERP allows customers to rapidly deploy, scale and extend their solutions in a highly-available, highly-secure environment.  QAD’s Cloud Operations group manages the end-to-end process of the deployment of the enterprise system, including the provisioning of the customer’s environments, performing continuous system performance tuning and monitoring to avoid disruptions, ensuring backup and disaster recovery processes are in place, applying software upgrades and patches, and ensuring industry best practice security processes are deployed.  Customer’s internal organizations can then focus on strategic initiatives while relying on QAD to provide their users with highly-secured and highly-reliable systems that support their ability to navigate through complexity and increasing disruption in their markets. 
 
QAD Cloud ERP and QAD Enterprise Applications are available in a blended model combining both deployment alternatives. Blended deployment enables users to transact more easily across business entities with a consistent interface and consistent functionality since our cloud and on-premises technology is the same. Companies that have chosen the cloud as a strategic direction but who cannot, or do not want to, move all locations at one time, find the blended deployment model allows them to transition to the cloud with less risk. The finance function can view individual business unit results and run consolidations that cross both cloud and on-premises sites seamlessly, while other users can transact and view inventory in multiple locations irrespective of whether any specific business entity is operating in the cloud or on-premises.
 
QAD Cloud ERP and QAD Enterprise Applications are comprised of the following software solutions:

Generally, our on-premises customers purchase maintenance when they acquire new licenses and our maintenance retention rate is more than 90%. Our maintenance and other revenue represented 37%, 42% and 47% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our maintenance revenue is negatively impacted by customers on maintenance converting to our cloud solutions. When maintenance customers convert to the cloud, they no longer contract for maintenance as those support services and unspecified updates are included as a component of the subscription offering. Our subscription revenue represented approximately 28%, 23% and 19% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our cloud customer retention rate is also in excess of 90%. We track our retention rate of cloud and maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal during the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of the maintenance retention rate calculation. Additional users and additional modules are not included in the annualized revenue for purposes of this calculation.

QAD GLOBAL PARTNER NETWORK
 
QAD establishes strategic relationships with our partners to expand our sales reach, improve our market impact, provide technological advantages and strengthen our strategic position in the industries that we serve. QAD and our partners are constantly evolving, broadening our expertise and our footprint in order to meet the diverse needs of our customers around the world. Today we have approximately 120 companies partnering with us to deliver innovative solutions, services and technology that help our customers build their Effective Enterprise.
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
 
QAD believes there are substantial growth opportunities in its cloud business over the coming years. Global manufacturers are facing unprecedented levels of disruption driven by advances in digital technologies. Responding to these changes requires a level of agility that legacy ERP solutions fail to deliver. QAD's Cloud ERP offers unparalleled speed of deployment and the ongoing ability to easily adapt and extend business models to meet the challenge of accelerating change. As a market leading solution for agile ERP, we expect to see a growing number of manufacturers moving from their legacy providers and turning to QAD to help them thrive in the digital manufacturing era. Additionally, we also expect to see a continuing conversion of our on premises customers to QAD's Cloud ERP. 
 
Our strategy is to enhance our position as a leading provider of cloud-based enterprise applications for global manufacturing companies. The key elements of our strategy, which we believe will drive continued growth, are as follows:
 
Leverage disrupted markets for new cloud customer acquisitions. The accelerating pace of change in our customers’ markets has created a disconnect between their business requirements and what their systems are able to support. Legacy ERP systems simply were not designed to support today’s rapid pace of change. The QAD Enterprise Platform was designed to provide greater fit and flexibility to easily meet tomorrow’s requirements. As such, disruption in our customers’ markets becomes a compelling reason for changing their ERP systems and one that we are well positioned to address. We are targeting segments within our primary verticals with the greatest disruption and actively pursuing new customers where we can provide the best fit.  We are investing in sales and marketing to focus on new customer acquisitions.  Three areas of disruption that we are targeting are: Anything as a Service (“XaaS”), make to order at scale, and the digital transformation of manufacturing (also known as Industry 4.0).

Grow our cloud business and expand our footprint within existing customers. We believe there is substantial opportunity to win new customers in the core vertical markets we serve and grow our cloud-based enterprise solutions within our global manufacturing customer base. Our cloud solutions allow our customers to focus on their products and services without the distraction of administering their enterprise applications or maintaining their infrastructure. With over 300,000 active users of our on-premises and cloud solutions, of which 43,000 are cloud users, we have many opportunities to increase cloud revenue across our existing installed base by converting our on-premises customers to our cloud-based solution and selling additional modules and users to our existing cloud customers
 
Continuous product development and rapid response to change.  Manufacturers are facing a swiftly changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying Industry 4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (“IoT”), Machine Learning (“ML”), Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Additive Manufacturing (“3D Printing”), Blockchain, Augmented Reality, and Predictive Analytics. We believe delivering a focused, flexible ERP system will be increasingly attractive to pragmatic manufacturers seeking a long-term fit of their business systems in support of their strategy in changing markets. We are committed to continuous investment in product development and advanced technologies to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve.
 
 Focus on global manufacturing and leverage expertise within key vertical markets. Many manufacturers operate globally, requiring a provider that can tailor solutions to the unique needs of their markets, deliver local and global services resources and support local languages. Solutions must be cost effective and easy to implement and use. Our solutions offer many benefits to customers with global operations, including capabilities that support operations in multiple geographies with a variety of languages and currencies, as well as compliance with complex local regulations and business practices. Our existing global footprint is a key leverage point for meeting these needs by utilizing offices, personnel and partnerships in many countries around the world. We also employ staff with specific knowledge and experience in the industries in which our customers operate. We provide our solutions to 26 segments across six vertical manufacturing markets; and we actively participate in several leading industry associations. Our industry knowledge continues to deepen through regular interaction with our customers. This collective experience allows QAD to develop solutions with specific capabilities that address our customers’ needs in the industries they serve.
 
Enhance customer experience to deliver continuous value and maximize customer retention. Our goal is to renew the subscription or maintenance agreements of our customers every year.  We deliver a continuous improvement process to ensure our customers are maximizing their investment in QAD products and using our software to operate their business at peak efficiency.   We strive to deliver excellent customer support via our maintenance and cloud offerings. We also engage with every customer every year, frequently conducting reviews of their business processes and presenting opportunities for improvement. Our deep vertical segment focus and strong, ongoing customer relationships drive continuous development of industry-specific functionality. As a result, we have maintained retention rates in excess of 90% annually.
 
TECHNOLOGY
 
QAD Enterprise Applications was designed to achieve our vision for global manufacturing companies to effectively run their business processes at peak efficiency, in alignment with their strategic goals. We have chosen the best technologies to achieve our vision, focusing on user experience, integration, business services, analytics, databases and deployment flexibility. We embrace ‘openness’ as a core principle of our designs, aiming to allow customers freedom of choice of devices and open connectivity with other systems. The core of QAD Enterprise Applications is built on a service based architecture, which allows QAD Enterprise Applications’ components to communicate with one another through industry-standard messaging techniques like Representation State Transfer services. This allows customers to exploit the full benefit of QAD’s open architecture for their businesses.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications core systems are built upon the QAD Enterprise Platform. The QAD Enterprise Platform is a micro-services architecture with the technologies and development tools needed to build a world class user experience (“UX”) with comprehensive functionality for global manufacturing companies.  This functionality is encapsulated into Apps that can be upgraded independently of each other as well as extended by customers.  Apps can be accessed securely over the Internet via a web browser or mobile devices (iOS and Android). The platform provides many advanced services to Apps like an App builder, security, integration, cloud support, analytics, mobile, collaboration and a world-class UX.  The platform supports UX, code, data and cloud flexibility to adapt readily to the ever-changing world of technology.  The UX is built using the latest open web technologies to support a rich HTML5 user interface. Business logic can be implemented in JavaScript via the more structured Type Script, Oracle’s Java or Progress Software Corporation’s OpenEdge language. Databases include MySQL, Progress OpenEdge and Cassandra data lake.
 
QAD’s enterprise architecture provides significant flexibility for global companies in deploying QAD Enterprise Applications. Our enterprise architecture allows companies to separate the legal structure of their business from physical operating locations or to separate both of these from the software instances and computer hardware that support them. With QAD enterprise architecture, customers can choose which sites are a part of which companies, which sites are supported on any instance of the application, or which sites operate as one instance. Customers can also choose centralized, decentralized or hybrid computing architectures with parts of their enterprise running from both central resources and local resources.

QAD combines our technologies to provide a comprehensive cloud solution for our customers. Our cloud architecture encompasses infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, management, monitoring and security; providing a world-class development operations practice built around Information Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL”) standards. QAD’s cloud infrastructure operates on a Cloud Management Platform. This enables QAD to seamlessly deploy customer systems to one of a number of global cloud infrastructure providers as part of the QAD Cloud offering.  Our cloud delivery centers are certified under the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management, the ISO 20000:2011 standard for service management (“SMS”), the ISO 27001:2013 standard for information security management (“ISMS”), the FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures, and the SSAE 16 (SOC I-Type II) requirements for reporting and compliance controls.
 
Cloud deployments are designed to be delivered as single tenant deployments. This decision was made based on our customers’ requirements for a mission critical system that they control. Providing customers with control over when to apply patches and upgrades reduces downtime and aligns to their business cycles. It also reduces the substantial costs associated with validation requirements in Life Sciences.
 
QAD takes a pragmatic approach to technology that is use case focused. We engage with our customers through experimentation in the QAD Labs. QAD Labs is a virtual combination of people, technology and passion for addressing the challenges of manufacturing planning and operations. The guiding force behind QAD Labs is the collaboration between QAD and our customers. This collaboration involves experimenting with advanced technologies to address legacy or emerging challenges. The experimentation is not hindered by the large budgeting cycles of major projects. By design, the QAD Labs approach allows for rapid application, rapid evaluation and strategic pivots to build on success or investigate alternatives.
 
This experimentation can be aligned with initiatives like Industry 4.0 and associated technologies such as IoT, Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation and Data Lakes. Alternatively, the initiative can be associated with innovation to solve long-term problems with the explosion of emerging new technologies. The pilot projects include machine learning, assisted planning and IoT integrated shop floor connectivity.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We continued to see our manufacturing customers’ businesses evolve during fiscal 2019 with a focus on connectivity to machines on the shop floor and data lakes to collect and analyze the rich information obtained from those machines. The products that our customers produce are becoming smarter and are now connected and participating in the IoT revolution. We are using Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics to streamline and make customers’ manufacturing processes smarter. We continue to maintain a global research and development organization that provides new product enhancements to the market on a semiannual basis in order to be responsive to industry and regulatory changes. We continue to support our customers as their operations move across the globe through our internationalization effort.
 
The enterprise software industry is continuing its transition from selling on-premises licenses to selling cloud-based solutions, which include flexible and adaptive integration, social media interaction, mobile computing and platform services capabilities. In fiscal 2019, we released a major upgrade to the Enterprise Edition software suite that was focused on supply chain efficiencies and flexible manufacturing. Our latest agile manufacturing module moved to general availability and gives our customers the ability to mix and match their manufacturing styles in one easy to use production process.
 
We continued the transition of our business model and product suite to cloud-based offerings as we moved our latest user experience and QAD Enterprise Platform to general availability for our cloud customers. We started an Early Adopter program for our on-premises customers. Our latest release supports mobile applications for decision making and provides insights into the health of our customers’ businesses through an Actionable Insights application. This offering is designed to give our customers even more value and flexibility when using our product suite with a secure browser from anywhere the user has connectivity. We continue to see more attempts of outside penetration or hacking with Internet facing applications which we take very seriously. We continue to have our software verified through an outside firm by scanning all the source code and performing penetration testing to preemptively identify and remove security flaws. With our web services, rich set of API’s and the QAD Enterprise Platform, our customers can more easily connect our product suite to other applications and extend our solution without customizing or writing code.
 
We dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to continually enhance and expand our product suite. For example, in fiscal 2019, we continued our internationalization program in support of our global customers. As we ended fiscal 2019, we were supporting our customers in over 70 countries with a single solution managed and maintained by QAD’s research and development organization. We continue to see a trend toward electronic invoicing and registration of shipments and invoices with government agencies to prevent falsification and tax avoidance. Spain, Mexico and Italy all introduced legislation in 2018 that requires all invoices to be registered with the government. We also see a continued tightening of tax legislation. India introduced a new Value Added Tax (“VAT”) process during 2018. We continue to support our customers through these changes without interruption to their business. Our goal is to continue to provide our customers with software that assists them in meeting the legal requirements of the countries in which they do business.

We operate a global research and development (“R&D”) organization comprised of 430 R&D employees located in offices in the United States, India, China, Ireland, Australia, France, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, Great Britain and Poland. Our R&D expenses totaled $54.0 million, $47.7 million and $43.6 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our software is primarily developed internally; however, we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is managed by our internal R&D organization. As needed, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining enough competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages and through our internationalization program we support mandatory governmental regulations and reporting requirements for over 70 countries. This is accomplished through a single offering for our customers in the cloud or on-premises, allowing them to run their businesses using a consistent core business model with the deployment model of their choice.
 
We plan to continue to manage significant product development operations globally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development at lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. We continually assess the significant costs and challenges, including intellectual property protection, against the benefits of our international development activities. 
 
DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES
 
QAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have a global strategic accounts team, which is responsible for managing QAD’s largest global customers across regions.
 
Our direct sales organization includes approximately 65 commissioned sales people. Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.
 
Our indirect sales channel consists of approximately 40 distributors and sales agents worldwide. We do not grant exclusive rights to any of our distributors or sales agents. Our distributors and sales agents primarily sell independently to companies within their geographic territory, but may also work in conjunction with our direct sales organization. We also identify global sales opportunities through our relationships with implementation service providers, hardware vendors and other third parties.
 
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy is to differentiate our offering by focusing on our role in providing value by helping our customers achieve the vision of the Agile, Rapid and Effective Enterprise. We are targeting segments within our primary verticals with the greatest disruption and where we can provide the best fit.
 
Our main marketing objectives are to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved and highlight hidden costs prospects may face to increase awareness and drive leads in these target segments. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include: account based marketing (“ABM”) for targeting, buying intent, and display advertising; press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; user conferences and events, such as Explore, as well as participation in other industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; search engine optimization; web site development and gamification to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations; case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; customer testimonials, references, and referrals; and sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers.
 
We recognize the changing buying dynamics and are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle in order to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by demonstrating the value of our products, answering questions, and removing roadblocks.
 
COMPETITION
 
Every aspect of our business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our on-premises and cloud offerings are rapidly evolving; highly competitive; and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Cost of implementation or conversion to the cloud and cost of ongoing maintenance and subscription are constant concerns when our customers make decisions about how best to deploy their resources.
 
 15



We compete with large, well-established enterprise application vendors, such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, who hold significant market share in the traditional ERP marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition; and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets.
 
Most enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premises sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large enterprise software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. In addition, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions.
 
We believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | Customer satisfaction
--+----------------------


● | Speed and ease of deployment and use of applications
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Total cost of ownership
--+------------------------


● | Performance and reliability
--+----------------------------


● | Capability for configuration, integration, security and scalability
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solution breadth and functionality
--+-----------------------------------


● | Technological innovation and ability to respond to customer needs rapidly
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial resources and
--+------------------------


● | Reputation of the vendor.
--+--------------------------

 
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. To further our market success, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors’ innovations. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.
