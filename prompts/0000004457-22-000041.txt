 Item 1. Business
 Company Overview
 We are North America’s largest “do-it-yourself” moving and storage operator through our subsidiary U-Haul International, Inc. (“U-Haul”). U-Haul is synonymous with “do-it-yourself” moving and storage and is a leader in supplying products and services to help people move and store their household and commercial goods. Our primary service objective is to “provide a better and better product and service to more and more people at a lower and lower cost.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “AMERCO,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to AMERCO, a Nevada corporation, and all of its legal subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. 
 We were founded in 1945 as a sole proprietorship under the name "U-Haul Trailer Rental Company" and have rented trailers ever since. Starting in 1959, we rented trucks on a one-way and in-town basis exclusively through independent U-Haul ®  dealers. In 1973, we began developing our network of U-Haul ®  managed retail stores, through which we rent our trucks and trailers, self-storage units and portable moving and storage units and sell moving and self-storage products and services to complement our independent dealer network.
 We rent our distinctive orange and white U-Haul ®  trucks and trailers as well as offer self-storage units through a network of over 2,100 Company-operated retail moving stores and nearly 21,100 independent U-Haul ®  dealers. We also sell U-Haul ®  brand boxes, tape and other moving and self-storage products and services to “do-it-yourself” moving and storage customers at all of our distribution outlets and through our uhaul.com ®  website.
 We believe U-Haul ®  is the most convenient supplier of products and services addressing the needs of the United States and Canada’s “do-it-yourself” moving and storage markets. Our broad geographic coverage throughout the United States and Canada and our extensive selection of U-Haul ®  brand moving equipment rentals, self-storage units, portable moving and storage units and related moving and storage products and services provide our customers with convenient “one-stop” shopping.
 Since 1945, U-Haul ®  has incorporated sustainable practices into its everyday operations. We believe that our basic business premise of equipment sharing helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the inventory of total large capacity vehicles. We continue to look for ways to reduce waste within our business and are dedicated to manufacturing reusable components and recyclable products. We believe that our commitment to sustainability, through our products and services and everyday operations has helped us to reduce our impact on the environment.
 Through Repwest Insurance Company (“Repwest”) and ARCOA Risk Retention Group ("ARCOA"), our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, we manage the property, liability and related insurance claims processing for U-Haul ® . Oxford Life Insurance Company (“Oxford”), our life insurance subsidiary, sells life insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, annuities and other related products to the senior market.

We also use our investor relations website as a means of disclosing material information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. All such filings on our website are available free of charge. Additionally, you will find these materials on the SEC’s website at sec.gov.
        Products and Rental Equipment
 Our customers are primarily “do-it-yourself” household movers. U-Haul ®  moving equipment is specifically designed, engineered and manufactured for the “do-it-yourself” household mover. These “do-it-yourself” movers include individuals and families moving their belongings from one home to another, college students moving their belongings, vacationers and sports enthusiasts needing extra space or having special towing needs, people trying to save on home furniture and home appliance delivery costs, and “do-it-yourself” home remodeling and gardening enthusiasts who need to transport materials.
 As of March 31, 2022, our rental fleet consisted of approximately 186,000 trucks, 128,000 trailers and 46,000 towing devices. This equipment and our U-Haul brand of self-moving products and services are available through our network of managed retail moving stores and independent U-Haul dealers. Independent U-Haul dealers receive rental equipment from the Company, act as rental agents and are paid a commission based on gross revenues generated from their U-Haul ®  rentals.
 Our rental truck chassis are engineered by domestic truck manufacturers. These chassis are joined with the U-Haul ®  designed and manufactured van boxes primarily at U-Haul ®  operated manufacturing and assembly facilities strategically located throughout the United States. U-Haul ®  rental trucks feature our proprietary Lowest Deck SM , which provides our customers with extra ease of loading. The loading ramps on our trucks are the widest in the industry, which reduce the effort needed to move belongings. Our trucks are fitted with convenient, rub rails with tie downs on every interior wall. Our Gentle Ride Suspension SM  helps our customers safely move delicate and prized possessions. Also, the engineers at our U-Haul Technical Center determined that the softest ride in our trucks was at the front of the van box. Consequently, we designed the part of the van box that hangs over the front cab of the truck to be the location for our customers to place their most fragile items during their move. We call this area Mom’s Attic ® .
 Our distinctive trailers are also manufactured at these same U-Haul ®  operated manufacturing and assembly facilities. These trailers are well suited to the low profile of many of today’s newly manufactured automobiles. Our engineering staff is committed to making our trailers easy to tow, safe, aerodynamic and fuel efficient.
 To provide our self-move customers with added value, our rental trucks and trailers are designed with fuel efficiency in mind. Many of our trucks are fitted with fuel economy gauges, another tool that assists our customers in conserving fuel. To help make our rental equipment more reliable, we routinely perform extensive preventive maintenance and repairs.
 We also provide customers with equipment to transport their vehicles. We provide two towing options: auto transport, in which all four wheels are off the ground, and a tow dolly, in which the front wheels of the towed vehicle are off the ground.
 To help our customers load their boxes and larger household appliances and furniture, we offer several accessory rental items. Our utility dolly has a lightweight design and is easy to maneuver. Another rental accessory is our four wheel dolly, which provides a large, flat surface for moving dressers, wall units, pianos and other large household items. U-Haul ®  appliance dollies provide the leverage needed to move refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers easily and safely. These utility, furniture and appliance dollies, along with the low decks and the wide loading ramps on U-Haul ®  trucks and trailers, are designed for easy loading and unloading of our customers’ belongings.
 The total package U-Haul ®  offers to the “do-it-yourself” household mover doesn’t end with trucks, trailers and accessory rental items. Our moving supplies include a wide array of affordably priced U-Haul ®  brand boxes, tape and packing materials. We also provide specialty boxes for dishes, computers, flat screen television and sensitive electronic equipment, as well as tape, security locks, and packing supplies. U-Haul ®  brand boxes are specifically sized to make loading easier.
 We estimate that U-Haul ®  is North America’s largest seller and installer of hitches and towing systems. In addition to towing U-Haul ®  equipment, these hitching and towing systems can tow jet skis, motorcycles, boats, campers and horse trailers. Each year, millions of customers visit our locations for expertise on complete towing systems, trailer rentals and the latest in towing accessories.
U-Haul® has one of North America’s largest propane refilling networks, with over 1,200 locations providing this convenient service. We employ trained, certified personnel to refill propane cylinders and alternative fuel vehicles. Our network of propane dispensing locations is one of the largest automobile alternative refueling networks in North America.
       

        Our self-storage business was a natural outgrowth of our self-moving operations. Conveniently located U-Haul ®  self-storage rental facilities provide clean, dry and secure space for storage of household and commercial goods. Storage units range in size from 6 square feet to over 1,000 square feet. As of March 31, 2022, we operate 1,844 self-storage locations in the United States and Canada, with nearly 876,000 rentable storage units comprising 75.1 million square feet of rentable storage space. Our self-storage centers feature a wide array of security measures, ranging from electronic property access control gates to individually alarmed storage units. At many centers, we offer climate-controlled storage units to protect temperature sensitive goods.
 Another extension of our strategy to make “do-it-yourself” moving and storage easier is our U-Box ®  program.    A U-Box ®  portable moving and storage unit is delivered to a location of our customer’s choosing either by the customers themselves through the use of a U-Box ®  trailer, with the assistance of a Moving help program or by Company personnel. Once the U-Box ®  portable moving and storage unit is filled, it can be stored at the customer’s location, or taken to one of our Company operated locations, a participating independent dealer, or moved to a location of the customer’s choice.
 Additionally, we offer moving and storage protection packages such as Safemove ®  and Safetow ® . These programs provide moving and towing customers with a damage waiver, cargo protection and medical and life insurance coverage. Safestor ®  provides protection for storage customers from loss on their goods in storage. Safestor Mobile ®  provides protection for customers stored belongings when using our U-Box ®  portable moving and storage units. For our customers who desire additional coverage over and above the standard Safemove ®  protection, we also offer our Safemove Plus ®  product. This package provides the rental customer with a layer of primary liability protection. 
 We believe that through our website, uhaul.com, we have aggregated the largest network of customers and independent businesses in the self-moving and self-storage industry. In particular, our Moving help program connects “do-it-yourself” movers with thousands of independent service providers in the United States and Canada to assist our customers in packing, loading, unloading, cleaning and performing other services. 
 Through the U-Haul Storage Affiliates ®  program, independent storage businesses can join one of the world’s largest self-storage reservation systems. Self-storage customers making a reservation through uhaul.com ®  can access all of the U-Haul self-storage centers and all of our independent storage affiliate partners for even greater convenience to meet their self-storage needs. For the independent storage operator, our network gives them access to products and services allowing them to compete with larger operators more cost effectively.
 We own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services. Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business. We consider the trademark “U-Haul ® ” to be of material importance to our business in addition, but not limited to, the U.S. trademarks and service marks “AMERCO ® ”, “eMove ® ”, “Gentle Ride Suspension SM ”, “In-Town ® ”, “Lowest Decks SM ”, “Moving made Easier ® ”, “Make Moving Easier ® ”, “Mom’s Attic ® ”, “Moving Help ® ”, “Moving Helper ® ”, “Safemove ® ”, “Safemove Plus ® ”, “Safestor ® ”, “Safestor Mobile ® ”,  “Safetow ® ”,    “U-Box ® ”, “uhaul.com ® ”, “U-Haul Investors Club ® ”, “U-Haul Truck Share ® ”, “U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 ® “ “U-Note ® ”, “WebSelfStorage ® ”, and “U-Haul SmartMobilityCenter ®” , among others, for use in connection with the moving and storage business. 
 Description of Operating Segments
 AMERCO’s three reportable segments are:

®
, U-Haul
®
, and Amerco Real Estate Company 

 (“Real Estate”), and the subsidiaries of U-Haul
®
 and Real Estate,


Property and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Repwest and its subsidiaries and ARCOA, and


Life Insurance, comprised of Oxford and its subsidiaries.


 Financial information for each of our operating segments is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as part of Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
       

        Moving and Storage Operating Segment
 Moving and Storage operating segment (“Moving and Storage”) consists of the rental of trucks, trailers, portable moving and storage units, specialty rental items and self-storage spaces primarily to the household mover as well as sales of moving supplies, towing accessories and propane. Operations are conducted under the registered trade name U-Haul ®  throughout the United States and Canada.
 Net revenue from Moving and Storage was approximately 94.0%, 93.1% and 91.8% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 The total number of rental trucks in the fleet increased from fiscal 2022. Continuing supply issues with our equipment manufacturers have slowed the number of new trucks we have been able to acquire this last year. In response, we have slowed the sale of trucks from our existing fleet.
 Within our truck and trailer rental operation, we are focused on expanding our independent dealer network to provide added convenience for our customers. U-Haul ®  maximizes vehicle utilization by managing distribution of the truck and trailer fleets among the over 2,100 Company-operated stores and nearly 21,100 independent dealers. Utilizing its proprietary reservations management system, our centers and dealers electronically report their inventory in real-time, which facilitates matching equipment to customer demand. Over half of all U-Move ®  rental revenue originated from our operated centers.
 At our owned and operated retail stores, we are implementing new initiatives to improve customer service. These initiatives include improving management of our rental equipment to provide our retail centers with the right type of rental equipment, at the right time and at the most convenient location for our customers, effectively marketing our broad line of self-moving related products and services, expanding accessibility to provide more convenience to our customers, and enhancing our ability to properly staff locations during our peak hours of operations by attracting and retaining “moonlighters” (part-time U-Haul ®  system members with full-time jobs elsewhere) during our peak hours of operation.  U-Haul offers U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 ®  to our entire network in the United States and Canada. This technological advancement allows our customers to rent equipment through the mobile device any time of the day without having to visit the counter. U-Haul currently has several U.S. and Canadian Patents pending on its U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 ®  system.
 Our self-moving related products and services, such as boxes, pads and insurance, help our customers have a better moving experience and help them to protect their belongings from potential damage during the moving process. We are committed to providing a complete line of products selected with the “do-it-yourself” moving and storage customer in mind. 
 Our self-storage business operations consist of the rental of   self-storage units, portable moving and storage units, sales of self-storage related products, the facilitation of sales of services, and the management of self-storage facilities owned by others.
 U-Haul ®   is one of the largest North American operators of self-storage and has been a leader in the self-storage industry since 1974. U-Haul ®   operates nearly 876,000 rentable storage units, comprising 75.1 million square feet of rentable storage space with locations in 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces. Our owned and managed self-storage facility locations range in size up to 309,000 square feet of storage space, with individual storage units in sizes ranging from 6 square feet to over 1,000 square feet.
 The primary market for storage units is the storage of household goods. We believe that our self-storage services provide a competitive advantage through such things as Max Security, an electronic system that monitors the storage facility 24 hours a day, climate control in select units, individually alarmed units, extended hours access, interior load and unload at selected locations, mobile device enabled rentals and an internet-based customer reservation and account management system.
Moving Help® and U-Haul Storage Affiliates® on uhaul.com are online marketplaces that connect consumers to independent Moving Help® service providers and thousands of independent Self-Storage Affiliates. Our network of customer-rated Moving Help® and affiliates provide pack and load help, cleaning help, self-storage and similar services all over the United States and Canada. Our goal is to further utilize our web-based technology platform to increase service to consumers and businesses in the moving and storage market. 
       

        Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.
 Moving and Storage business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally our weakest.
 Property and Casualty Insurance Operating Segment
 Our Property and Casualty Insurance operating segment (“Property and Casualty Insurance”) provides loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul through regional offices across the United States and Canada. Property and Casualty Insurance also underwrites components of the Safemove ® , Safetow ® , Safemove Plus ® , Safestore Mobile ®  and Safestor ®  protection packages to U-Haul customers. We attempt to price our products to be a good value to our customers. The business plan for Property and Casualty Insurance includes offering property and casualty products in other U-Haul related programs.
 Net revenue from Property and Casualty Insurance was approximately 1.9%, 1.9% and 2.2% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Life Insurance Operating Segment
 Life Insurance provides life and health insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity policies. 
 Net revenue from Life Insurance was approximately 4.1%, 5.0% and 6.0% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Human Capital     We work at never forgetting that our quality self-move, self-storage, and closely related services and products are meant to improve human lives and serve the do-it-yourself moving public.    Our workforce is a reflection of, and as diverse as the customers we serve.    Discrimination based on race, gender, religion, age, ethnicity, disability or familial status in the acquisition, promotion or compensation of talent is not accepted.    The Company does not manage to any one specific numerical measurement as part of its hiring human resource management.        System Members     As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 32,200 people in the United States and approximately 1,900 in Canada with approximately 99% of these system members working within Moving and Storage and approximately 48% of these system members working on a full-time basis.        The Company operates over 2,100 retail locations, 11 manufacturing and assembly facilities, 149 fixed-site repair facilities, a distribution center and our corporate offices.    We hire system members from the communities in which we are located and prefer to promote from within our team.      Benefits     We focus on our system members’ wellness over the course of their life, from physical and emotional to financial.     Our health benefit program provides medical, dental and vision benefits.  Participation in the health benefit program also includes access to our Healthier You wellness program that offers system members the tools necessary to live a healthier lifestyle.  This wellness program encompasses nutritional guidance, smoking cessation and fitness alternatives.  We also make available a system members assistance program focusing on mental health called You Matter, which offers counseling, work-life solutions and legal guidance.
      

        We encourage a work-life balance for our system members and their families through paid time off and various leave options as well as special benefits including a healthy pregnancy program and a 24/7 doctor-on-call program for their children.     Financial benefits are a critical component of our system members’ wellness.    These benefits include competitive salaries, participation in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and 401(k) plan, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, and the SmartDollar ®  financial literacy program.        Education and Development     The Company encourages life-long personal and professional development for our system members.    To that goal, we offer our system members and our independent dealers free access to our on-line U-Haul University.    These courses are critical for the development of specialized industry knowledge and to the safety of our team.    For more generalized education, we also provide a tuition reimbursement program.     Community     We value our relationship with the communities in which we do business. We offer community outreach through volunteer opportunities for our system members, to in-kind donations of equipment, products, and services. We are a strong supporter of military members and their families by way of employment opportunities as well as partnering with military and veteran organizations to support and honor those who have served.     Sales and Marketing
 We promote U-Haul ®  brand awareness through direct and co-marketing arrangements. Our direct marketing activities consist of web-based initiatives, print and social media as well as trade events, movie and television cameos of our rental fleet and boxes, television commercials, and industry and consumer communications. We believe that our rental equipment is our best form of advertisement. We support our independent U-Haul ®  dealers through marketing U-Haul ®  moving and self-storage rentals, products and services.
 Our marketing plan focuses on maintaining our leadership position in the “do-it-yourself” moving and storage industry by continually improving the ease of use and economy of our rental equipment, by providing added convenience to our retail centers, through independent U-Haul dealers, and by expanding the capabilities of our U-Haul websites. 
 A significant driver of rental transaction volume is our utilization of an online reservation and sales system, through uhaul.com and our 24-hour 1-800-GO-U-HAUL telephone reservations system. These points of contact are prominently featured and are a major driver of customer lead sources.
 Competition
 Moving and Storage Operating Segment
 The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. Generally speaking, we consider there to be two distinct users of rental trucks: commercial and “do-it-yourself” residential users. We primarily focus on the “do-it-yourself” residential user. Within this segment, we believe the principal competitive factors are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential products and services, and total cost to the user. Our major national competitors in both the in-town and one-way moving equipment rental market include Avis Budget Group, Inc. and Penske Truck Leasing. We have numerous competitors throughout the United States and Canada who compete with us in the in-town market.
The self-storage market is large and very fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Our largest competitors in the self-storage market are Public Storage Inc., Extra Space Storage, Inc., CubeSmart and Life Storage, Inc.
       

        Insurance Operating Segments
 The insurance industry is highly competitive. In addition, the marketplace includes financial services firms offering both insurance and financial products. Some of the insurance companies are owned by stockholders and others are owned by policyholders. Many competitors have been in business for a longer period of time or possess substantially greater financial resources and broader product portfolios than our insurance companies. We compete in the insurance business based upon price, product design, and services rendered to agents and policyholders.  Financial Data of Segment and Geographic Areas
