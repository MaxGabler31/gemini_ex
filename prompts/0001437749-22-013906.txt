Our Segments
 
As described in Note 14. "Segment Data" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this annual report, following the acquisition (the "Agena Acquisition") of Agena Bioscience, Inc. ("Agena") on October 20, 2021, we changed our reporting segments to align with strategic changes in the way we manage our business units. We report our financial performance in four segments, or divisions: (1) Sterilization and Disinfection Control, (2) Biopharmaceutical Development, (3) Calibration Solutions, which represents a combination of the historical Instruments and Continuous Monitoring reporting segments, and (4) Clinical Genomics, a new reporting segment comprised entirely of Agena's operations. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.
Sterilization and Disinfection Control
 Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control division manufactures and sells biological, chemical, and cleaning indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization processes, including steam, gas, hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide, radiation, and other processes in the pharmaceutical, medical device, hospital, and dental industries. The Sterilization and Disinfection Control division also provides related testing services, mainly to the dental industry. 
 Page 2 

  

Biological indicators consist of resistant spores of certain microorganisms that are applied on a convenient substrate, such as a small piece of filter paper. The spores are well characterized in terms of purity, population of spores, and resistance to sterilization. Our biological indicator products are manufactured by growing microbiological spores from raw materials, using the spores to form finished products, and testing the finished biological indicators using established quality control tests. Our dental sterilizer testing products are assembled into kits containing biological indicator spore strips. Our microbiological laboratory tests these kits when they are returned to us to determine the effectiveness of our customers' sterilization processes.
 
Our biological indicators are distinguished in the marketplace by their high level of quality, consistency, and flexibility. We offer a variety of different product formats, which allows our biological indicators to be used in many different types of processes, equipment, and environments. For example, our simple spore strips are used most often in small table-top steam sterilizers in dental offices, while our more complex self-contained biological indicators, either with or without process challenge devices ("PCDs"), may be used by medical device manufacturers to assure sterility in complex ethylene oxide sterilization processes. In either case, the population of spores contained on the carrier and the resistance of the spores to the sterilization process must be well characterized in order to accurately assess the effectiveness of sterilization. During manufacture, extensive quality control steps are used to ensure that the microorganism spores are well-characterized and their resistance is known following placement on the target carrier.
 
Chemical indicators use a chemical change (generally determined by color) to assess the exposure to sterilization conditions. Biological indicators and chemical indicators are often used together to monitor processes.
 
Cleaning indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of cleaning processes, including washer-disinfectors and ultrasonic cleaners in healthcare settings. Cleaning is the critical first step performed prior to disinfection and sterilization. Debris left on an instrument may interfere with microbial inactivation and can compromise disinfection or sterilization processes. Cleaning indicators complement sterilization and disinfection processes within central sterile supply departments, such as in hospitals. Our cleaning indicator products are manufactured by inoculating a test soil onto a stainless-steel coupon. The test soil is designed to mimic the challenge of removing blood and tissue from surgical instruments and evaluates the effectiveness of our customers' cleaning processes. 
 
Our Bozeman, Montana and Munich, Germany locations manufacture our Sterilization and Disinfection Control division products, which include the EZTest®, ProSpore®, PCD®, Apex® and Simicon biological and cleaning indicators. Our Bozeman, Montana facility also provides sterility assurance testing services to dental offices in the United States and Canada. Sterilization and disinfection control products are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions. We generate sales to end users through our direct sales personnel and independent distributors. Customers include hospitals, dental offices, contract sterilization providers and various industrial users involved in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing. 
 
Our sterilization and disinfection control products are used in highly regulated industries and compete on the basis of quality, cost effectiveness, and suitability for intended use. We compete with various other sterilization and cleaning indicator providers, and additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may be introduced.
 
Biopharmaceutical Development
 Our Biopharmaceutical Development division develops, manufactures, and sells automated systems for protein analysis (immunoassays) and peptide synthesis solutions. Protein analysis and peptide synthesis solutions accelerate the discovery, development, and manufacture of biological therapies, among other applications. Customers include biopharmaceutical research, development, and manufacturing teams at biopharmaceutical companies and their contract research organization partners, as well as academic research and development laboratories. The Biopharmaceutical Development division sells two types of products: (1) protein analysis solutions, which are used to test for the existence or concentration of specific proteins in a fluid sample, and (2) peptide synthesis solutions, which automate the synthesis of peptides from amino acids; both are primarily used in biopharmaceutical research, discovery and development, and bioprocessing. Our Biopharmaceutical Development division develops and manufactures Gyrolab® xPand and Gyrolab xPlore® hardware and software, as well as Gyrolab Bioaffy® consumable microfluidic disks (“CDs”), and Gyrolab kits and Rexxip® buffers for protein analysis in Uppsala, Sweden, while PurePep® Chorus, Symphony® X, and Sonata® XT hardware and associated software for peptide synthesis are developed and manufactured in our Tucson, Arizona location. Products manufactured in Sweden are typically invoiced in U.S. Dollars or euros, whereas the costs to produce the products is incurred in Swedish Krona. As a result, the Biopharmaceutical Development segment is susceptible to changes in foreign currency. For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements” and “Our international operations subject us to a wide range of risks.”

About one-third of our Biopharmaceutical Development revenues are from consumables used on a routine basis. Sales of these products are less sensitive to general economic conditions. Approximately 45% of revenues are from more discretionary hardware purchases that are more sensitive to general economic conditions. The remainder of sales are related to service and support agreements. We generate sales directly as well as through independent foreign distributors. Marketing activities include industry conferences, user meetings, educational webinars, and all forms of digital marketing, in addition to market sensing and capturing user requirements for new product roadmaps. In-person marketing largely resumed during the year ended March 31, 2022 as many COVID-19 restrictions gradually lifted. 
 
The Biopharmaceutical Development division’s market success is primarily dependent upon creating innovative, high quality products that customers choose based on available features, cost-effectiveness, and performance. We believe we are one of the leading world-wide suppliers of protein analysis and peptide synthesis equipment to the biologics discovery and development market. We further believe that enhancements of our product offerings and new product development driven by our research and development team, the recognized quality of our products and support, and the ability to continue to bring novel, cutting edge products and solutions to the market will allow us to remain competitive in the growing markets we serve. 
 
Protein Analysis
 We develop, manufacture, and market protein analysis equipment, CDs, kits, and buffers that enable the detection and quantification of a target protein in a biological or bioprocess sample. Gyrolab technology is widely used across human and non-human applications, mainly for therapy development and bioprocess design. Customers, primarily pharmaceutical and biotech companies and their contract research organization partners developing protein-based therapies, use our CDs to deposit their samples for mixing with application specific reagents. The CDs and reagents are loaded into one of our instruments for processing and analysis. Our proprietary software interprets results and provides useful data analysis for decision-making. Our protein analysis products accelerate the development and processing of assays to obtain accurate results for pre-clinical and clinical studies as well as for upstream and downstream bioprocessing of biological therapies, thus meeting critical data and time requirements. Our analytical protein technologies provide superior data consistency and accuracy, and reduce labor and the attendant variability of more manual analysis methods.
Peptide Synthesizers
 Our peptide synthesis solutions enable customers to automate the chemical synthesis of peptides used in the creation of peptide therapies, biomaterials, cosmetics, and general research. Our peptide synthesis products facilitate the ability to produce more complex and longer peptides with higher purity, and are designed to comply with related Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and European Medicines Agency requirements. Customers of our peptide synthesizers include commercial and academic biopharmaceutical laboratories, as well as contract manufacturers of peptides. 
Calibration Solutions 
 Our Calibration Solutions division develops, manufactures, and sells quality control and calibration products used to measure or calibrate temperature, pressure, pH, humidity, and other such parameters for health and safety purposes, primarily in hospital, medical device manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and various laboratory and healthcare environments. Generally, our Calibration Solutions products are used for testing, quality control, safety, validation and regulatory compliance. As of March 31, 2022, our Lakewood, Colorado and Hanover, Germany facilities manufacture our Calibration Solutions products, which include continuous monitoring systems, dialysate meters and consumables, data loggers, gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment, and torque testing systems represented by the ViewPoint®, Point Six, CheckPoint®, AmegaView, FreshLoc®, DialyGuard®, DataTrace®, DryCal®, Torqo®, SureTorque®, IBP Medical, and BGI brands. During fiscal year 2022, we closed our Butler, New Jersey location, which previously manufactured our gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment products. These manufacturing operations have since moved to Lakewood, Colorado. 
 
The majority of our Calibration Solutions products have relatively long lives and their purchase by customers is discretionary, so sales are more sensitive to general economic conditions. Service demand is driven by our customers’ quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instruments products. Most of our Calibration Solutions products are manufactured by assembling the products from purchased components and calibrating the final products prior to release, though certain continuous monitoring products are assembled and calibrated on site at customer locations. Our Calibration Solutions division's commercial efforts focus on offering quality products to our customers that will aid them in containing cost, improving the quality of their products and services, and meeting regulatory requirements. We generate sales through our direct sales personnel and independent distributors.

Continuous Monitoring
Our continuous monitoring products are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained. Continuous monitoring systems are used in controlled environments such as refrigerators, freezers, warehouses, laboratory incubators, clean rooms, and a number of other settings. The continuous monitoring systems consist of wired or wireless sensors that are placed in controlled environments, hardware modules to receive the data, and various software programs to collect, store and process the data. Our systems are designed to operate continuously, providing data around the clock, 365 days per year. We provide recalibration of sensors through our dedicated service organization and SnapCalTM self-managed probe exchange program. Because of the advantages of our continuous monitoring systems, we have a solid market share in North America, but are not currently focused on international expansion.
 
A critical function of our systems is the ability to provide local alarms and notifications via e-mail, text, or telephone, if established environmental conditions are exceeded. Among the important competitive differentiators of our continuous monitoring systems are (1) their high degree of reliability and up-time; (2) a large variety of sensor types to meet the needs of most applications; (3) a skilled, distributed installation and service team; and (4) a full-featured and 21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic records; Electronic signatures) validated software program, providing extensive reporting and alarm capability. Key markets for our continuous monitoring systems are hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments, all located in North America. 
 
Dialysate Meters and Calibration Consumables
 Our medical meters are used to test various parameters of dialysis fluid (dialysate) and the proper calibration and operation of dialysis machines used in dialysis clinics. Each meter measures some combination of temperature, pressure, pH, conductivity and flow to ensure that the dialysate has the proper composition to promote the transfer of waste products from the blood to the dialysate. The meters provide a digital readout that the technician uses to verify that a dialysis machine is working within prescribed limits and delivering properly prepared dialysate. We manufacture two styles of medical meters: those designed for use by dialysis machine manufacturers and biomedical technicians, and those used primarily by dialysis clinicians. The meters for technicians are characterized by exceptional accuracy, stability and flexibility, and are used by the industry as the primary standard for the calibration of dialysis machines and water system testing. The meters designed for use by dialysis clinicians are known primarily for their ease of use and incorporate a previously patented, built-in syringe sampling system. These meters are used as the final quality control check on the dialysate just prior to starting a treatment. In addition to the dialysate meters, we market a line of standard consumable solutions for use in dialysis clinics for calibration of our meters. These standard solutions are regularly consumed by the dialysis clinics; thus, along with calibration services that we also provide, are less impacted by general economic conditions than dialysate meters sales. Customers that utilize these products include dialysis facilities, medical device manufacturers, and biomedical service companies. In addition to competition in the dialysis meter business, our products face regulatory and technological challenges. For a discussion of risks related to our regulatory and technological challenges, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors "Changes in dialysis methods may decrease demand for our dialysis products and negatively impact our financial statements."
 
Data Loggers
 Our data loggers are self-contained, wireless, high precision instruments used in critical manufacturing and quality control processes in the pharmaceutical, medical device, food, and tool industries. They are used to measure temperature, humidity and pressure inside a process or a product during manufacturing. In addition, data loggers can be used to validate the proper operation of laboratory or manufacturing equipment, either during installation or for annual re-certifications. The products consist of individual data loggers, a personal computer (“PC”) interface, software, and various accessories. Customers typically purchase a large number of data loggers along with a single PC interface and the software package. In practice, using the PC interface, the user programs the loggers to collect environmental data at a pre-determined interval, places the data loggers in the product or process, and then collects stored process data from the data logger either through the PC interface or wirelessly via a radio link. The user can then prepare tabular and graphical reports using the software. Unique aspects of our data loggers are their ability to operate at elevated temperatures and in explosive environments – important differentiating factors in the marketplace. Consequently, they are used by companies to control their most critical processes, such as sterilization. We face competition in data logger sales from several other companies, some of which have well-established commercial organizations, particularly in Europe.

Gas Flow Calibration and Air Sampling Equipment
 We manufacture a variety of instruments and equipment for gas flow calibration and environmental air sampling. In the air sampling area, our technology is used primarily for the determination of particulate concentrations in air as a measure of urban or industrial air pollution, and for industrial hygiene assessments. The primary products include air samplers, particle separators and pumps. While both the public and private sector continue to focus on air quality and its impact on the environment and the health of populations, technological advances in real-time monitoring have made the traditional air sampling market more limited. In the environmental area, our particle samplers were some of the first on the market and they were recognized early-on as “reference samplers” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This product has a competitive advantage in the market because our particle separation cyclones hold the only “federal reference method” distinction for the measurement of PM2.5 in ambient air and are sold to most manufacturers of ambient particulate measurement instrumentation.
 
We also manufacture gas flow calibration instruments to support the use of our air sampling equipment, and for broader industrial applications. Our gas flow calibration instruments provide the precise standards required by laboratories and industry in the design, development, manufacture, installation and calibration of various gas flow meters and air sampling devices. Our flow calibrators are used by professionals in many industries, including (1) industrial hygienists and environmental technicians, (2) calibration and research laboratories, (3) manufacturers who design, develop and manufacture gas flow metering devices, and (4) industrial engineering and manufacturing companies that utilize gas flow metering devices. We see expanded opportunities in gas flow calibration as markets that heavily use and measure process gas are growing. There is competition in gas flow calibration; however, our products are distinguished against the competition by their unique dry piston technology and industry-leading accuracy and certifications.
 
Due to the relocation of gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment production from Butler, NJ to Lakewood, CO, sales of these products were lower during the year ended March 31, 2022; however, we expect a return to normal sales levels in future years.
 
Torque Testing Systems
 Our automated torque testing systems are durable and reliable motorized cap torque analyzers that measure the amount of force required to open a container. The primary advantages of our torque instruments are their high accuracy and long-term consistency of measurement. Our motorized torque systems eliminate the errors associated with manual torque testing. With a motorized torque testing system, the force applied to a cap is precisely the same in each testing cycle, regardless of the strength of the machine's operator. Our torque systems provide information that helps the packaging operation track events and potential problems during the manufacturing process so corrections can be performed in a timely fashion. Industries utilizing these instruments include pharmaceutical and beverage and food processing companies. Given the niche nature of this product, there is a relatively low level of competition this product line; however, the growth of this line is limited by the growth of new manufacturing facilities and packaging regulations in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Clinical Genomics
 During the year ended March 31, 2022, we added a new reportable segment, Clinical Genomics, as a result of the Agena Acquisition discussed further in Note 4 to the financial statements included in this report, “Significant Transactions.” Our Clinical Genomics division develops, manufactures, and sells highly sensitive, low-cost, high-throughput genetic analysis tools used by labs to perform clinical genomic testing in several therapeutic areas.
 
Clinical Genomics’ MassARRAY® system couples mass spectrometry with end-point polymerase chain reaction ("PCR") methods, enabling highly multiplexed reactions under universal cycling conditions to provide accurate, sensitive, rapid genetic analysis. Using the MassARRAY® system and our proprietary consumables, including chips, panels, and chemical reagent solutions, customers can analyze DNA samples for a variety of high volume clinical testing applications such as inherited genetic disease testing, newborn screenings, pharmacogenetics, various oncology tests, infectious disease testing, and other highly-differentiated applications. The MassARRAY® system is differentiated in the market by its ability to target up to 50 specific DNA variants in a single PCR reaction and run up to 384 samples on one SpectroCHIP® array, up to eight times in a full workday, with the flexibility to process additional samples overnight. The system allows for the testing of hundreds of mutations, including SNPs, insertions, deletions, translocations, copy number variation, and methylation makers, all in a single, efficient workflow. Using time-of-flight mass spectrometry, genetic variants are distinguished by analysis of their individual mass, eliminating the need for fluorescence or labeling. The system's integrated software provides a user-friendly interface to generate reports that identify the targets and review spectra. 
 
    Page 6 

  

In addition to the MassARRAY® system and related consumable products, Clinical Genomics also sells services, including equipment maintenance contracts and custom laboratory services through which our scientists help customers develop specified assay designs. About 70% of our Clinical Genomics revenues to date are from consumables used on a routine basis. Sales of these products are less sensitive to general economic conditions. Approximately 20% of our Clinical Genomics revenues to date are from more discretionary hardware products that are more sensitive to general economic conditions. The remainder of Clinical Genomics revenues are related to service and support agreements.
 
Clinical Genomics sells its products and services primarily to clinical labs, including large specialty, reference, and pathology labs, as well as to a variety of academic, hospital, and government facilities. The majority of revenues are derived from customers in the United States and China. Our Clinical Genomics products are manufactured in San Diego, California, primarily by assembling purchased subcomponents designed to our specification into finished goods, and by processing and mixing reagents. Our Clinical Genomics products generate revenues primarily through direct sales, and also through independent distributors in certain regions.
 
Clinical Genomics products are manufactured under a quality system that complies with ISO 13485 for the design, development, manufacture, distribution, installation, and servicing of diagnostic products, reagents, and instruments for genetic analysis and life sciences.
 
Corporate and Other
 Corporate and other consists of unallocated corporate expenses, the non-reportable operating segment Cold Chain Packaging division that ceased operations during the year ended March 31, 2020, and other business activities. 
 
Other Matters Relating to our Business as a Whole
 
Acquisitions
 Year Ended March 31, 2022 Acquisitions
 On October 20, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Agena Bioscience, Inc. for adjusted cash consideration of $300.8 million. Agena is a leading clinical genomics tools company that develops, manufactures, markets, and supports proprietary instruments and related consumables and services that enable genetic analysis for a broad range of diagnostic and research applications. The acquisition of Agena moves our business toward the life sciences tools sector and expands our market opportunities, particularly in Asia. 
Year Ended March 31, 2020 Acquisitions
 On October 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Gyros Protein Technologies Holding AB ("GPT" or the "GPT acquisition") for adjusted cash consideration of $181.5 million. The acquisition expanded our presence into a new market - immunoassays and peptide synthesis solutions -that accelerate the development, and manufacture of biotherapeutic drugs. GPT systems include laboratory instruments, consumables, kits, and software that maximize laboratory productivity by miniaturizing and automating immunoassays at nanoliter scale. 
 
On April 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of IBP Medical GmbH, a company whose business manufactures medical meters used to test various parameters of dialysis fluid (dialysate), and the proper calibration and operation of dialysis machines.
 
Manufacturing and Materials
 Most of the components, raw materials, and other supplies used in our product lines are available from a number of different suppliers. We generally maintain multiple sources of supply, but we are dependent on single sources for certain items, particularly in the Biopharmaceutical Development and Clinical Genomics divisions. We continue to emphasize reviewing our supply base and designs for single source or sole source suppliers that might affect our ability to supply critical product to our customers. We have experienced increased supply constraints for certain components used in our operations, particularly components used by the Calibration Solutions and Biopharmaceutical Development divisions, and to a lesser extent the Sterilization and Disinfection Control and Clinical Genomics divisions. We continue to work with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future impacts to our supply chain, and we are making efforts to mitigate such impacts, including pre-ordering components in higher quantities than usual. See further discussion within Item 1A. Risk Factors,“We face numerous manufacturing and supply chain risks. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.”
 
Major Customers
 No individual customer represented more than 10% of our accounts receivable or revenues in any of the past three years. 
 
    Page 7 

  

Backlog
 We define backlog as firm orders from customers for products and services where the order will be fulfilled within the next 12 months. Backlog as of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 was approximately $21.3 million and $11.3 million, respectively. The increase in backlog is attributable to supply chain constraints causing order fulfillment delays, the addition of Clinical Genomics into our overall backlog, and delays resulting from moving production of our gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment from Butler, NJ to Lakewood, CO.
Research and Development
 Research and development ("R&D") activities are primarily directed towards innovating new products and improving the quality and performance of our existing products or altering our current products to accommodate use of raw materials that are more readily available for purchase in our supply chain. Other R&D efforts also seek to develop or improve software that will be sold, leased, or marketed in the future, and improve manufacturing efficiencies. 
Intellectual Property
 We own numerous patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights, each of which is important to the various facets of our business. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our products and services are sold under various trade names, trademarks and brand names. We consider our trade names, trademarks and brand names to be valuable in the marketing of our products in each segment. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.
Regulatory Matters
 Mesa's operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse, import and export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy, government contracts acquisition regulations, and other areas.
 
We are required to comply with certain ISO standards and United States Pharmacopeia standards in order to sell some of our products to certain customers. While our quality system and manufacturing processes are generally the same throughout the Calibration Solutions division, specific products are compliant under ISO 13485, ISO 17025, ISO 9001 and certain U.S. federal regulations. Our Uppsala, Sweden and Tucson, Arizona facilities, part of the Biopharmaceutical Development division, are ISO 9001:2015 certified. Clinical Genomics operates a quality management system which complies with the requirements of ISO 13485:2016 and EN ISO 13485:2016. We obtain third party certification to remain compliant with ISO standards.
 
Several products in the Sterilization and Disinfection Control, Calibration Solutions, and Clinical Genomics divisions are medical devices subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires any company proposing to market a medical device to notify the FDA of its intention at least 90 days before doing so. We have received permission from the FDA to market all of our products requiring such permission. Some of our facilities are subject to FDA regulations and inspections, which may be time-consuming and costly. This includes ongoing compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations that require, among other things, the systematic control of manufacture, packaging and storage of products intended for human use. Failure to comply with these practices renders the product adulterated and could subject us to an interruption of manufacturing and selling these products, and possible regulatory action by the FDA.
 
The manufacture and sale of medical devices is also regulated by some states. Although there is substantial overlap between state regulations and the regulations of the FDA, compliance with some state laws may require additional cost or effort; however, we do not anticipate that complying with state regulations will create any significant problems.
 
Foreign countries also have laws regulating medical devices sold in those countries, which require additional resources for compliance. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies can be lengthy and the requirements may differ. 
 
We are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal or sensitive data in the course of our business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation which imposes strict requirements on how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data.

Government Contracts
 Although we transact business with various U.S. government agencies, no government contract or aggregate contracts are of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contracts at the election of the government would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Human Capital Management
 As a company, our vision is to Protect the Vulnerable® and we believe that our vision is achieved in large part through the strength of our workforce. Every day, our talented employees strive to implement lean based tools to find ways to continuously improve our products and services so that we may better serve our customers. We recruit top talent from all backgrounds using a combination of industry expert recruiters and recruiting tools. We support employees with compensation, benefits and development programs aimed at ensuring employees are productive and engaged. 
Employees
 As of March 31, 2022, we had 681 employees, of whom 298 are employed for manufacturing and quality assurance, 114 for research and development and engineering, 175 for sales and marketing, and 94 for administration. Our voluntary employee turnover was 12% during the year ended March 31, 2022. We believe that our turnover rate indicates that employees remain at Mesa because of the opportunities to grow and develop within the company. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to diversity and inclusion (“D&I”), and we are always working to improve in this area. We train our managers annually on anti-discrimination and anti-harassment practices. We continue to evolve our talent acquisition process to focus on diversity for both external hires and succession planning. Our recruiting standards require that we consider candidates from two or more underrepresented categories for all director-level or higher positions, and our global cloud-based human capital management platform enables us to more accurately track employee representation and identify how we can better enhance our diversity around the world. Our executive officers have committed to help drive further D&I progress during our year ending March 31, 2023 and beyond. As of March 31, 2022, 50% of our board of directors are from under-represented categories.
Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation and benefits are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. In determining merit increases, we evaluate individual performance—including measuring an individual's contribution to company goals and performing semi-annual performance reviews—to align financial incentives with individual contributions. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, cash bonuses, stock-based compensation to certain levels of employees, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off, and paid caregiver leave, among other benefits.
Communication and Engagement
 We believe that our success depends in part on our employees understanding how their work contributes to our company purpose and strategy. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly town hall meetings with our executive team; (ii) internally maintained websites; (iii) an anonymous whistleblower hotline that is advertised to our employees; and (iv) employee engagement surveys. We also measure employee net promoter scores, which is an employee ranking of how likely they are to recommend working at Mesa to a family member or friend. Our employee net promoter scores decreased during the year ended March 31, 2022. Based on the results of the net promoter score surveys, we are undertaking several initiatives to improve employee engagement, including implementing salary increases and leadership development programs. We will continue tracking and making efforts to improve the score going forward.
