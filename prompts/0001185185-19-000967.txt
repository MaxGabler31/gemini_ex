Item 1. Business
General
 
We are a boric acid manufacturing company in the PRC. Our strategy is to expand our existing boric acid manufacturing facilities to produce lithium carbonate for the rapidly growing electric vehicle ("EV") battery market in China. We have collaborated with our director, Xing Hai Li, to build a prototype production line that is capable of producing up to 1,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 2,000 tons of boric acid per year which we plan to expand to 30,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 60,000 tons of boric acid per year over the next five years which we expect to be funded by internal growth, debt and equity financing of approximately $180,000,000. According to Fastmarkets, the May 2019 price for battery grade lithium carbonate in China was between 70,000 – 77,000 RMB per ton (approximately $10,000 – $11,000 per ton) and between 4,530 and 4,620 RMB per ton (approximately $650 to $670 per ton). We source our ore and brine exclusively from our affiliated company located in nearby Dachaidan Lake and its surrounding areas.
 
We currently operate our production facility through our wholly owned subsidiary, Qing Hai Mid-Heaven Boron & Lithium Technology Company, Ltd. (“Qinghai Technology”). Qinghai Technology manufactures and sells boric acid and related compounds for industrial and consumer use. We purchase and process mineral rich ore and brine exclusively from our affiliated mining company Qing Hai Mid-Heaven Boron & Lithium Mining Company, Ltd. (“Qinghai Mining”) and are one of the leading producers of boric acid in China with a production capacity of approximately 15,000 tons per year of boric acid or approximately 62% of the output in the in Qinghai Province and 10.7% of total production in China according to an annual report published by the China Inorganic Salts Industry Association (CISIA). Our boric acid is sold to industries located throughout the PRC. We have a unique “one step production” methodology in China which we believe gives us a significant advantage over our competitors.
 
Our Strategy
 
We believe that growth in the Electric Vehicle (“EV”) industry will drive significant growth in the demand for lithium carbonate. Qinghai Technology successfully completed a pilot brine extraction project with a partner where it extracted and produced industrial grade lithium carbonate and boric acid from the mineral rich waters of Dachaidan Lake located approximately 8 kilometers from its manufacturing facility.
 
Qinghai Technology plans to process the deposits of lithium harvested from brine sourced out of Dachaidan Lake and its surrounding areas. We plan to leverage our position as leading producer of boric acid and boron in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China, leverage our knowledge of mineral processing in boric acid, boron and related minerals, develop our supply and sales chain for battery grade lithium carbonate and upgrade our facilities and production processes to produce lithium carbonate for batteries used in China’s rapidly growing EV’s. We will need to the funding for the first phase of our development to produce 10,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year will initially require approximately $20,000,000 and an additional $160,000,000 to expand to 30,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 60,000 tons of boric acid per year.
 
We believe our current production experience, exclusive access to local natural resources, and current financial condition uniquely position us to transition our business into being a unique, profitable, pure-play source of lithium to the China markets.

Our Boron and Lithium Business
 
Boron
 
Qinghai Technology has the production capacity of approximately 15,000 tons of boric acid and related chemicals per year by using the traditional extraction processes of crushing ore and processing the resultant dust through its facilities. We believe our facility produced approximately 10.7% of the total national output in the PRC in 2018 according to an annual report produced by the CISA. We plan to replace the crushed ore processing with processing brine sourced from nearby Dachaidan Lake by the middle of 2020 subject to financing. We plan to expand current ore processing production capacity from 15,000 tons annually to 60,000 tons of boric acid annually.
 
China and the US are the largest consumers of boric acid. The major end users of boric acid are manufacturers of ceramic and tiles and fiberglass which accounts for nearly 50% of the global consumption of boric acid. Pharmaceuticals, agriculture, cosmetics, and wood preservation industries are the other end users of our boric acid. The global boric acid market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5.55% during the period from 2018 to-2022.(Source: Tecnivo “Huge Demand in Boric Acid Compound Market 2019-2025”) There is a limited set of competitors in the boric acid and boron market because supplies are very limited which consist of Borax Morarji, Gujarat Boron Derivatives Private, Mizushima Ferroalloy, Russian Bor, Rio Tinto Group, Searles Valley Minerals and Tomiyama Pure. (Source: Tecnivo “Top 6 Vendors in the Global Boric Acid Market from 2016 to 2020”). We also plan to improve our production process to produce boron for will be hardened steel used in nuclear plants, heavy machinery cars, trucks and aircraft.
 
Qinghai Technology has historically sold all of the material it has produced, and we believe the trend will continue as it shifts its production away from crushed ore to the brine refinement process. In 2018, Qinghai Technology produced approximately 10,500 tons of boric acid from operations due to a two-month closure due to plant maintenance. It expects to sell all of the boric acid it produces in 2019. In addition, we believe that margins and purity will improve due to the lower cost of production, improved reclamation processes and reduction of hazardous waste material. Qinghai Technology’s boric acid in May of 2019 sold for approximately RMB 4,350 (USD 630) per ton which we expect to increase to approximately RMB 7,000 (USD 1,015) per ton due to improvement in the purity of our product with new production techniques.
 
Qinghai Technology uses the one-step method to produce boric acid. Boron ore is mixed with sulfuric acid, processed through a mixing process and heated until boric acid powder is produced. Qinghai Technology obtains sulfuric acid in both pure form and recycled sulfuric acid disposed as a hazardous waste product by industrial users.
 
The current consumption of boric acid in the Chinese market is about 550,000 tons per year with a market value of 1.7 billion yuan, or approximately $247 million with imports consisting of approximately 234,000 tons. (Source: Annual Report by CISIA). We currently distribute or boric acid through the following industrial distribution channels: Dingjia Zhixin (鼎佳智信), Sichuan Dawei (四川达威), Chengdu Fuyang (成都蜀阳), Del Bor Industry (德尔硼业), Jinchang Xi Li (金昌西立) and Xinjiang Huier Agricultural Group (新疆慧尔农业集团) which account for our largest customers.

Lithium

Our Lithium business will be designed to produce lithium carbonate for the EV battery markets in China. We believe that when we establish our brine extraction manufacturing facilities that we will be a competitive source of low-cost producer lithium carbonate producer for use by battery manufactures in China. Most of our local competitors obtain raw materials typically consisting of spodumene (lithium ore) from outside of China in order to produce lithium carbonate. We believe we will be one of the few local China based lithium carbonate producers with a local supply of raw materials making us a pure-play China based lithium carbonate producer for the local EV battery market.
 
Production of battery grade lithium carbonate is a priority for China’s national industrial policy and is in line with the Qinghai province's economic development policy. Source: Qing Hai Province government’s guide document (2018 No 41)“The guideline for improvement of Lithium Industry in Qing Hai Province” issued by Qing Hai Province Government Office) It plays an important role and practical significance for promoting the development of the local economy and the extension of the industrial chain. We believe our lithium carbonate project will receive favorable tax incentives and be able to operate at high margins. We have inexpensive sources of electricity, coal, natural gas resources and labor resources to produce our products. Brine processing technology is also more environmentally friendly and reliable than processing ore obtained from traditional strip-mining methods which reduces our expenses for reclamation.
 
Qinghai Mining plans to transport evaporated brine from its brine pools to our processing plant. The brine will be treated with chemicals to separate the boron from the lithium and transferred to two different assembly lines where they are further processed into boric acid, boron and related compounds and into lithium carbonate. The process will be divided into two steps. In the first step, the boron extractant will be used to extract boron to produce crude boric acid, and then sent to the existing boric acid factory for finishing to produce refined boric acid; the second step will use lithium extractant to extract lithium, and after extracting lithium, the battery-grade lithium carbonate will be produced by precipitation method.
 
The extraction process of lithium from brine pools involve several transitions between ponds. First the brine material will be pumped from underground brine wells into a pond where itis expected to evaporate allowing it to concentrate. Then the concentrated brine will be pumped to another pond where sodium chloride will crystalize and precipitate. The brine is then moved to another ponds where more sodium chloride precipitation occurs and then slaked lime will be added they are depleted, leaving a brine consisting of approximately 0.5% lithium. The brine is transported by underground and over ground piping system to Qinghai Technology where lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is extracted
 
Lithium is typically extracted from the mineral spodumene and from brine-lakes, salt-pan deposits or salt flats. The extraction process of lithium from brine-lakes requires less energy and lower production costs than spodumene ore deposits.

Pilot Brine Processing Assembly Line for Lithium Carbonate and Boric Acid
 

If we are successful in our funding efforts, we plan to locate the operations in a new, nearby facility located in the Boric Chemical Industrial Zone in Haxi. As a qualified business under the China Government’s strategy of Develop-the-West, from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2020, all the qualified business including Qinghai Technology is subject to a reduced income tax rate of 15% compared to a national customary rate of 25%. Each of the three facilities will house brine processing plants expected to produce 10,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 20,000 tons of boric acid, boron and related compounds per year.
 
We received all of our environmental permits from Haixi Environmental Protection Bureau on April 2, 2011 (Xihuanzi (2011)( No. 63)and production permits to commence our new brine processing business in Haxi) We plan to initially establish a production line producing 3,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 6,000 tons of boron acid annually which will require initial funding of approximately $20,000,000. We expect to produce 10,000 tons of lithium carbonate and 20,000 tons of boric acid in 2020 if we are able to meet our funding target of an additional $40,000,000. In the third phase of our development plans, we plan to raise an additional $120,000,000 of financing to produce 30,000 tons of lithium carbonate for EV batteries and 60,000 tons of boric acid. According to Fastmarkets, the May 2019 price for battery grade lithium carbonate in China was between 70,000 – 77,000 RMB per ton (approximately $10,000 – $11,000 per ton) and between 4,530 and 4,620 RMB per ton (approximately $650 to $670 per ton) for boric acid.

Competition
 
The global lithium market consists of producers primarily located in the Americas, Asia and Australia. Our competitors supplying lithium compounds include Livent Corporation, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., Sichuan Tianqi Lithium, and Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium. Competition in the lithium market is largely based on product quality, product diversity, reliability of supply and customer service. In china our principal competitors are the Yahua Group, Tainqui Lithium and Gangfen Lithium
 
Expansion of our Production Capacities
 
Global electric vehicle sales grew from 1.2 million units in 2012 to 3.0 million units in 2017, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%, and is expected to reach 8.6 million units by 2022, representing a CAGR of 23%, according to CRU International Limited. The Chinese government has also been focusing on developing the new-energy vehicle industry and has introduced generous incentives to encourage purchases of electric vehicles. From 2016 to 2017, the demand for lithium-based batteries shifted from a focus on quantity to quality and we believe there is a shortage in supply of high quality lithium batteries but an excess supply of low quality lithium batteries.
 
We plan to further modernize and expand our facilities, plant and brine extraction process at of Qinghai Technology to increase lithium carbonate production to 30,000 tons per year and boric acid production to approximately 60,000 tons per year. In order to reach these production targets, we and our subsidiaries will embark on a capital improvement project to raise approximately $180,000,000 in equity, debt, bank funding and government subsidies in order to open a new three building facility and production line located in the Boron Chemical Industrial Zone in Haixi.
 
Qinghai Technology and Qinghai Mining have received all necessary commercial, environmental and water extraction rights for the commercialization of lithium carbonate and boric acid from Dichaidan Lake.
 
As a qualified business under the China Government’s strategy of Develop-the-West, from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2020, all the qualified business including Qinghai Technology is subject to a reduced income tax rate of 15% compared to a national customary rate of 25%.

Our History
 
We were originally incorporated as Pacific Goldrim Resources, Inc.on August 4, 2006, in the State of Nevada and, at that time, had little or no operations. On April 14, 2008 we changed our name to SmartHeat Inc. and acquired all of the equity interests in Shenyang Taiyu Machinery & Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd. (“Taiyu”), at that time a leading developer of plate heat exchangers and heat pumps in China. In December of 2014, we sold Taiyu to members of our former management team. Since that time the company serviced existing customers, sold existing inventory and wound down its heat pump business operations after filing for bankruptcy protection in the PRC in 2016.
 
On December 31, 2018, we acquired as our wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-Heaven Sincerity International Resources Investment Co., Ltd, and its wholly owned subsidiary Qinghai Technology in exchange for 141,919,034 shares of our Common Stock in a tax-free reorganization. We expect to discontinue or sell the remainder of our prior business operations during our 2019 fiscal year.
 
We were originally formed as a state owned entity in 1954 producing boron related products and filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Our Chief Executive Officer purchased the assets of the company and founded Qing-Hai Zhong Tian Boron & Lithium Mining Co., Ltd on March 6th 2001. Qinghai Technology was spun out of Qing-Hai Zhong Tian Boron & Lithium Mining Co., Ltd on December 20, 2018 and Qing-Hai Zhong Tian Boron & Lithium Mining Co., Ltd changed its name to Qing Hai Mid-Heaven Boron & Lithium Mining Company, Ltd.
 
Our current corporate structure is set forth in the following diagram:

Regulation
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the SEC and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations:
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.”  That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to larger companies
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes/Oxley Act of 2002.  The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created an independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthen auditor independence.  It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders at special or annual meetings thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.
 
We are also required to file Annual Reports on SEC Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on SEC Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on SEC Form 8-K.
 
Laws of the Peoples Republic of China
 
Our subsidiaries located in China are subject to national, provincial and local laws of the PRC. The legal system in China is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979, China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic and commercial matters, but these recently enacted laws and regulations may not cover all aspects of business activities in China sufficiently. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to our subsidiaries. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, there may be certain instances when we may not be aware of our subsidiaries violation of these policies and rules until sometime after such violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.

The PRC government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. Our subsidiaries’ ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes under these laws and regulations is unpredictable, however, because the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations is limited and, given their relative newness, involve uncertainties. For example, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail than those under U.S. law and generally are not as comprehensive in defining the rights and obligations of the contracting parties. Consequently, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges than those in the U.S. In addition, contract interpretation and enforcement in China is not as developed as in the U.S., and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties. Our subsidiaries currently are not subject to any contract dispute, but we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will not be subject to future contract disputes with our suppliers, franchisees and other customers under contracts governed by PRC law, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will prevail.
 
Industry Polices
 
Foreign investors and foreign-funded enterprises investing in China are required to comply with the Catalog for Guiding on Foreign Investments in Industries (《外商投資產業指導目錄》) which was initially promulgated by the National Planning Commission (國家計劃委員會), the State Economic and Trade Commission (國家經濟 貿易委員會) and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (對外貿易經濟合作部) on June 28, 1995 and subsequently amended on December 31, 2001, March 11, 2002, November 30, 2004, October 31, 2007, December 24, 2011 and March 10, 2015. The latest amendment was made on June 28, 2017 and came into effect on July 28, 2017. The catalog for guiding on foreign investments has served as domestic management and guidance on foreign investments for a long time. It classifies industries into three basic types: Encouraged, Restricted and Prohibited. The Catalogue divides industries into three categories: “encouraged,” “restricted,” and “eliminated” for investment. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as falling into a fourth category, “permitted.”.
 
Domestic industry development mainly follows the guidance on relevant industry structures introduced by the NDRC. According to the Notice of the National Development and Reform Commission [2017] No. 1 —— Guiding Catalog of Key Products and Services for Strategic Emerging Industries (2016) (《國家發展和改革委員會公告2017年第1號——戰略性新興產業重點產品和服務指導目錄(2016版）》) promulgated and implemented by the National Development and Reform Commission on January 25, 2017 lithium and boron extracting from carbonate-type brine rich in lithium and boron fall into the key products and services in strategic emerging industries. According to the Guiding Catalog for Industrial Restructuring (2011 Edition) (《產業結構調整指導目錄（2011年本）》), which was promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission on March 27, 2011, with the latest amendment on February 16, 2013, and was implemented on May 1, 2013, exploration and comprehensive use of scarce chemical mineral resources, such as lithium and boron fall into the state-encouraged industries.
 
Regulations on Tax
 
Our business operations are governed primarily by tax laws in the PRC. A description of the material tax consequences applicable to holders of our common shares may be found in the section titled “Item 10. Additional Information.-E. Taxation.” For more information regarding the impact of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, see “Risk Factors — Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “Resident Enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.”
Foreign Exchange Regulation
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.

In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
In July 2014, SAFE decided to further reform the foreign exchange administration system in order to satisfy and facilitate the business and capital operations of foreign invested enterprises, and issued the Circular on the Relevant Issues Concerning the Launch of Reforming Trial of the Administration Model of the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises in Certain Areas, or Circular 36, on August 4, 2014. This circular suspends the application of Circular 142 in certain areas and allows a foreign-invested enterprise registered in such areas to use the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital for equity investments within the PRC.
 
On March 30, 2015, SAFE released the Notice on the Reform of the Management Method for the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19, which has made certain adjustments to some regulatory requirements on the settlement of foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises, lifted some foreign exchange restrictions under Circular 142, and annulled Circular 142 and Circular 36. However, Circular 19 continues to, prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.
 
On June 19, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or Circular 16, which took effect on the same day. Compared to Circular 19, Circular 16 not only provides that, in addition to foreign exchange capital, foreign debt funds and proceeds remitted from foreign listings should also be subject to the discretional foreign exchange settlement, but also lifted the restriction, that foreign exchange capital under the capital accounts and the corresponding Renminbi capital obtained from foreign exchange settlement should not be used for repaying the inter-enterprise borrowings (including advances by the third party) or repaying the bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to the third party.
 
SAFE Circular 37
 
In July 2014, SAFE issued SAFE Circular 37, which supersedes SAFE Circular 75, and requires that PRC citizens or residents must register with the relevant local SAFE branch before making capital contribution to any offshore entity directly established or indirectly controlled by that PRC citizen or resident for the purpose of investment or financing and with onshore or offshore assets or equity interests legally owned by that PRC citizen or resident. In addition, the SAFE registrations are required to be updated with local SAFE branch with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with the change of its basic information, such as its company name, business term, shareholding by individual PRC citizens or residents, merger, or division and, with respect to the individual PRC citizens or residents in case of any increases or decreases of capital in that offshore special purpose company, or share transfers or swaps by the individual PRC citizens or residents.

Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. We will make efforts to comply with these requirements.
Regulation of Dividend Distribution
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations and the Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Labor Laws and Social Insurance
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
 
In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds.
 
PRC Laws and Regulations on Hazardous Chemicals 
 
1. Administrative Measures for the Registration of Hazardous Chemicals (《危險化學品登記管理辦法) 
 
According to the Administrative Measures for the Registration of Hazardous Chemicals (《危險化學品登記管理辦法》) promulgated by the State Administration of Work Safety of the People’s Republic of China (中華人民共和國國家安全生產監督管理總局) on July 1 , 2012 and effective from August 1 , 2012, a newly established production enterprise of hazardous chemicals shall proceed with the hazardous chemicals registration procedure before the completion and acceptance of the project. The Hazardous Chemicals Registration Certificate (危險化學品登記證) is valid for three years. The Hazardous Chemicals Registration Certificate (危險化學品登記證) should set out details such as the nature of the enterprise (hazardous chemicals producer, hazardous chemicals exporter or a hazardous chemicals producer and exporter), the registered products and the validity period.
