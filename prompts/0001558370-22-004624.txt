Item 1.       Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases of the eye. We have worldwide rights to a portfolio of innovative products and product candidates that include two marketed products utilizing our proprietary mucus penetrating particle, or MPP, drug delivery technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY® technology, to address medical needs for the front of the eye. Our product candidates and programs include a proprietary regenerative biotherapy for severe ocular diseases and a pipeline of preclinical new chemical entities, or NCEs, targeted to address front and back of the eye diseases.
Our two marketed products are EYSUVIS® (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 0.25%, for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, and INVELTYS® (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1%, a topical twice-a-day ocular steroid for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Both products apply our AMPPLIFY technology to loteprednol etabonate, or LE, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications. The AMPPLIFY technology uses selectively-sized nanoparticles that each have a proprietary coating. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus. 
EYSUVIS is the first and only FDA-approved prescription product with an indication for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved EYSUVIS in October 2020, and we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in January 2021. We believe that EYSUVIS’ broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies offer a favorable profile for the management of dry eye flares and other dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from short-term treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms. We further believe that these features of EYSUVIS are attractive to prescribing clinicians and EYSUVIS could become the preferred first-line prescription therapy for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, including the treatment of dry eye flares that affect the vast majority of dry eye patients. 
INVELTYS is the first and only FDA-approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The FDA approved INVELTYS in August 2018, and we commercially launched the product in January 2019. INVELTYS has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the target ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. We believe INVELTYS offers advantages over existing post-surgical treatment options. 
Upon the consummation of our acquisition of Combangio, Inc., or Combangio, on November 15, 2021, we acquired Combangio’s product candidate, CMB-012, which we now refer to as KPI-012. KPI-012 is our lead product candidate and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects, or PCED, a rare disease of impaired corneal healing. We believe the multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren’s Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis. For a description of the financial terms of the acquisition of Combangio, see “Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
We are also progressing our pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs targeted to address both front and back of the eye diseases. These preclinical development programs include KPI-287, our receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, or TKI, and our selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, or SEGRMs. 
KPI-287 is designed to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, and platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF, pathways, and is administered by suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and retinal vein occlusion, or RVO. SEGRMs are a novel class of therapies designed to modify the downstream activity of the 

6




glucocorticoid receptors to exhibit the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the corticosteroid class of therapies while markedly reducing their associated side effects, which we are developing for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. 
The following table describes our marketed products and the stage of each of our current clinical and preclinical development programs: 

We have retained worldwide commercial rights for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012 and our preclinical development programs. Starting with FDA approval of INVELTYS, we have built a commercial infrastructure with our own focused, specialty sales force which now includes approximately 100 field-based commercial sales personnel. Our sales representatives promote both EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.
We own and/or exclusively license patents relating to EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012, our preclinical development programs and our AMPPLIFY technology, including U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications. The expiration dates of issued U.S. and ex-U.S. patents covering EYSUVIS and INVELTYS are in 2033. The expiration dates of the issued U.S. patents that we control covering KPI-012 are in 2040, and a portfolio of additional U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications covering KPI-012 is currently in prosecution. The expiration dates of issued U.S. and ex-U.S. patents relating to our AMPPLIFY technology are in 2025 through 2036.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies primarily for diseases of the front and back of the eye. Key elements of our strategy include: 

● | Maximize the commercial potential of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. EYSUVIS is the first and only FDA-approved prescription product with an indication for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. EYSUVIS was approved in October 2020, and we commenced a full promotional launch in January 2021. We estimate that approximately 17.2 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with dry eye disease. We believe that EYSUVIS’ broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies, offers a favorable profile for the management dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from short-term treatment. We further believe that EYSUVIS could become
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7





the preferred first-line prescription therapy for treating dry eye flares, which affect the vast majority of dry eye patients. We also expect to explore commercialization of EYSUVIS for the treatment of dry eye disease in certain markets outside of the United States, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVELTYS is the first and only FDA approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Other approved topical ocular corticosteroid products for this indication are dosed three or four times a day. In January 2019, we began to commercialize INVELTYS in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force.

● | Advance the clinical development of, and seek and obtain regulatory approval for, KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED and other indications. KPI-012 is a novel, human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, or MSC, secretome currently in clinical development for the treatment of PCED. A PCED is a persistent non-healing corneal defect or wound that is refractory to conventional treatments. Based on the positive results of a Phase 1b clinical efficacy trial of KPI-012 in patients with PCED, we plan to submit an investigational new drug, or IND, application to the FDA for KPI-012 and, subject to regulatory clearance, commence a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPI-012 for PCED in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. If the results of our planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPI-012 are positive, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we believe this trial can serve as the first of two required pivotal trials. If so, we plan to conduct an additional Phase 3 pivotal trial in PCED patients to support the potential submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA. If approved, we intend to commercialize KPI-012 with a small, targeted, internal sales force in the United States. We also expect to explore commercialization of KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED in certain markets outside the United States utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties. We further believe that the multifactorial nature of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren’s Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis.

● | Advance our pipeline of preclinical development programs. We are also progressing our pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs targeting both front and back of the eye diseases. These programs include KPI-287, our TKI product candidate that inhibits the VEGF and PDGF pathways, for the treatment of retinal diseases, including wet AMD, and our SEGRMs, which are a novel class of therapies designed to modify the downstream activity of the receptors to exhibit the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties while markedly reducing side effects associated with corticosteroids. We own all intellectual property and worldwide rights to these preclinical development programs. Prior to initiating IND-enabling studies, we may consider potential collaborative partnership opportunities to advance product candidates we develop, including through these programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business development through selective transactions. We plan to pursue value-driven business development opportunities as they arise in order to enhance our business and product pipeline, which may include strategically acquiring preclinical or clinical product candidates, particularly in the ophthalmic area. We also plan to explore a variety of transactions to maximize the value of our assets, including out-licensings, collaborations, divestitures, distributions and other development and marketing arrangements with one or more third parties for our products and product candidates.

EYSUVIS for Dry Eye Disease
Dry Eye Disease Overview
Dry eye disease is a chronic, episodic, multifactorial disease affecting the tears and ocular surface that can result in tear film instability, inflammation, discomfort, visual disturbance and ocular surface damage. While the precise cause of dry eye disease is not fully understood, it often involves impairment of the lacrimal unit, which consists of the lacrimal glands, ocular surface and the sensory and motor nerves that connect them, and has a significant inflammatory 

8




component. There is significant published research that suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the development of dry eye disease. Dry eye disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can potentially cause long-term damage to the ocular surface. Due to the impact of dry eye disease on tear film dynamics, the condition can affect performance of common vision-related activities such as reading, using a computer and driving, and can lead to complications associated with visual impairment. Dry eye disease is commonly treated by ophthalmologists and optometrists.
A significant number of dry eye disease patients experience acute, episodic exacerbations of their symptoms, which are commonly referred to as flares, at various times throughout the year that can cause significant discomfort and disability. A dry eye flare is defined as a rapid onset, inflammation-driven response to a variety of triggers that typically cannot be adequately managed with the patient’s ongoing therapy. As illustrated in the graphic below, these flares can be triggered by numerous factors, such as environmental stimuli related to exposure to allergens, pollution, wind and low humidity. Intense visual concentration, such as watching television or working at a computer, can also trigger flares. Other potential triggers include hormonal changes, contact lens wear, smoking and sleep deprivation, which cause ocular surface inflammation and impact tear production and/or tear film stability.




We estimate dry eye disease affects approximately 38 million people in the United States based on an estimated dry eye disease prevalence of 14.5% described below and applied to the population of the United States over 20 years old. Based on third-party academic research, we believe dry eye disease results in approximately $55 billion in direct and indirect costs in the United States each year, of which approximately $3.8 billion are direct medical costs. The exact prevalence of dry eye disease is unknown due to the difficulty in defining the disease and the lack of a single diagnostic test to confirm its presence. The Beaver Dam Offspring Study, a major epidemiological study published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, dry eye disease was self-reported by 14.5% of the patients. The prevalence of dry eye disease increases with age, and we expect that the number of dry eye disease cases will increase as the U.S. population continues to age. Epidemiology and market research commissioned by us indicate that there are an estimated 17.2 million patients with a diagnosis of dry eye disease in the United States. We also commissioned three surveys of 503, 297, and 500 dry eye disease patients, which we refer to as our patient surveys, in 2017, 2018, and 2020, respectively. The patient surveys included a representative set of dry eye patients based on demographics and disease characteristics, such as age, sex and therapeutic history. The patients represented a broad 

9




range of dry eye disease severity. Based upon our review of the patient surveys as well as independent studies conducted in 2020 and 2021 of 774 and 756 dry eye sufferers, respectively, we believe dry eye disease is a burdensome disease that has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with dry eye disease. 
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Dry Eye Disease
The most commonly used treatments for dry eye disease in the United States are over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears” or lubricating eye drops, and four prescription pharmaceutical products, Restasis®, Xiidra®, CequaTM and TyrvayaTM. 
Most over-the-counter artificial tears are palliative in nature and are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability. Artificial tears typically provide only short term or temporary relief by lubricating the eyes and helping to maintain moisture on the outer surface of the eye. Artificial tears do not treat the underlying inflammatory components of dry eye disease.

In addition to over-the-counter artificial tears, Restasis, Xiidra, Cequa and Tyrvaya are sometimes prescribed as a chronic therapy for the treatment of dry eye disease. We believe that less than 10% of patients diagnosed with dry eye disease in the United States use a chronic therapy to treat their disease. Restasis and Cequa are each topically applied, ophthalmic formulations of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Restasis and Cequa are not approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, but rather for increasing tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Restasis frequently causes burning upon instillation, and, according to the package insert, 17% of patients in clinical trials of Restasis reported ocular burning upon instillation. Cequa frequently causes pain upon instillation, and, according to the package insert, 22% of patients in clinical trials of Cequa reported pain upon instillation of drops. Xiidra is a topically applied, ophthalmic formulation of lifitegrast, a small molecule LF1a antagonist, which was approved by the FDA in July 2016 for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence rate of approximately 5% to 25%) following the use of Xiidra were instillation-site irritation, dysgeusia, and decreased visual acuity. Tyrvaya (varenicline solution) nasal spray is a cholinergic agonist that was approved by the FDA in October 2021 to increase tear production and treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. According to the Tyrvaya package insert, 82% of patients reported sneezing upon instillation. Tyrvaya, like Xiidra, Restasis and Cequa, is typically used chronically for dry eye patients who have continuous symptoms. As each of these medications have a relatively long onset of action, they are not generally used for the short-term treatment of episodic dry eye flares. 


We believe there is a larger proportion of dry eye patients whose symptoms are primarily episodic as opposed to chronic, and for whom a chronic therapy is not necessary and for whom EYSUVIS, an FDA-approved therapy for short-term use, can address a significant unmet need. For example, our patient surveys and the independent study of 774 dry eye sufferers indicate that approximately 75% to 90% of surveyed patients experience dry eye flares, with flares lasting on average approximately four days and occurring approximately six times per year. These results are also consistent with the 2021 independent, multi-sponsor survey of 756 dry eye sufferers indicating that they suffer a median of 5.25 flares per year lasting on average 4.9 days. In our 2021 survey of 201 eye care professionals, or ECPs, all reported that their patients have dry eye flares, but many underestimated the actual number of patients with flares. In addition, according to our patient surveys, the most common reason given by patients for discontinuing the two leading branded dry eye treatments were insufficient efficacy, side effects and product price.
EYSUVIS Opportunity in Dry Eye Disease
EYSUVIS received FDA approval for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in October 2020 utilizing a two-week course of therapy administered four times a day. We commenced our full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in January 2021.
We believe that EYSUVIS has a favorable profile for the management of dry eye disease flares and other dry eye associated conditions, including the following attributes:

● | Broad mechanism of action. LE is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are known for their broad anti-inflammatory properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10





● | Rapid onset of relief. In our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, patients treated with EYSUVIS reported reductions in ocular discomfort within days of initiation of treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. LE is one of the safest topical ocular steroids available due to its unique pharmacokinetics. LE was designed to be metabolized after exerting its anti-inflammatory action in the eye. The metabolism of LE to inactive metabolites reduces exposure of the trabecular meshwork, an area of tissue located in the anterior chamber that is responsible for draining the aqueous humor from the eye, to active steroid, thus reducing the risk of an increase in IOP relative to other steroids. EYSUVIS was well-tolerated across four clinical trials, with adverse events and IOP increases comparable to that observed with vehicle.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specifically targeting relief of episodic dry eye flares. The mechanism of action and rapid onset of relief of EYSUVIS in dry eye disease is distinct from that of artificial tears and chronic therapies like Restasis, Xiidra, Cequa and Tyrvaya. Therefore, we expect EYSUVIS to be used as a stand-alone short course therapy to provide rapid relief of dry eye flares by improving ocular discomfort (a dry eye symptom) and reducing ocular redness (a dry eye sign).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potentially complementary to existing therapies. We believe that patients on chronic therapies also experience dry eye flares and could potentially benefit from using EYSUVIS in addition to their maintenance therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that these attributes make EYSUVIS attractive to prescribing clinicians for treating patients that suffer from dry eye flares, and that EYSUVIS could become the preferred first-line prescription therapy for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, including the treatment of dry eye flares. 
Our current estimates of potential future revenue from sales of EYSUVIS are based, in part, on current prescription trends, anticipated changes in payer coverage, market growth assumptions and physician market research data we have commissioned that examines intent to prescribe. These estimates may be impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts will depend on the length and severity of this pandemic and the impact on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted.
EYSUVIS Clinical Development Program 
EYSUVIS was evaluated in four clinical trials. In January 2018, we announced topline results from two completed Phase 3 clinical trials, which we refer to as STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 (STRIDE - Short Term Relief In Dry Eye), evaluating the safety and efficacy of EYSUVIS versus vehicle (placebo) in patients with dry eye disease. In STRIDE 1, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia and the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in the intent to treat, or ITT, population; in addition, statistical significance was also achieved in STRIDE 1 for a second pre-specified primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in patients with more severe baseline ocular discomfort. In STRIDE 2, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia, but statistical significance was not achieved for the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity. EYSUVIS was generally well tolerated in both STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, with no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events observed during the course of either trial, and with elevations in intraocular pressure, or IOP, in both trials similar to placebo.
In October 2018, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for EYSUVIS. In August 2019, we announced that we received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding this NDA. The FDA indicated that efficacy data from an additional clinical trial would be needed to support a resubmission of the NDA. Based upon the previous recommendation of the FDA, we had initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, STRIDE 3, in the third quarter of 2018. In March 2020, we announced top line results from STRIDE 3, achieving statistical significance in the pre-specified primary endpoints of change from baseline to day 15 in ocular discomfort severity in the overall ITT population and in a pre-defined subgroup of patients with more severe baseline ocular discomfort. In addition, statistical significance was achieved for conjunctival hyperemia at day 15. Consistent with prior clinical 

11




experience, EYSUVIS was well-tolerated in STRIDE 3, with adverse events and intraocular pressure increases comparable to vehicle.
The positive results from STRIDE 3 for both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, along with the positive data from the previous clinical trials of EYSUVIS, served as the basis for our NDA resubmission in April 2020. EYSUVIS received FDA approval for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in October 2020. 
EYSUVIS Customer Concentration
Three customers comprised 10% or more of our revenue attributable to EYSUVIS during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These customers comprised 48%, 26% and 23% of our revenue, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 35%, 32% and 29% of our revenue, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020.

INVELTYS for Post-Operative Inflammation and Pain
Post-Operative Inflammation and Pain Overview
Ocular inflammation and pain are common complications following ocular surgery. In 2019, Marketscope, a third-party provider of market data, projected that the number of ocular surgeries in the United States would grow to approximately 10.1 million by 2024. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the ocular surgery market, and in 2020, there were only 7.0 million ocular surgeries reported by Marketscope, representing a decline of approximately 1.4 million from approximately 8.4 million ocular surgeries reported in 2019. In November 2021, Marketscope reported that ocular surgeries were projected to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of 2021. Commonly performed ocular surgeries include cataract, cornea, refractive, oculoplastic and glaucoma procedures. Tissue damage caused by ocular surgery leads to the production of prostaglandins, lipids that aid in recovery at the site of an injury, and increases in blood flow to the affected area, which contribute to inflammation. The standard of care for postoperative inflammation and pain includes anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, which improve patient comfort and accelerate recovery through disruption of the inflammatory cascade. 
INVELTYS was approved by the FDA on August 22, 2018 for the treatment of post-surgical inflammation and pain following all ocular surgery, and was commercially launched in the United States in January 2019. INVELTYS is the first and only twice-daily ocular corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Post-Operative Inflammation and Pain
Loteprednol etabonate, or LE, is a unique steroid that was designed to limit side effects, such as increases in IOP and cataract formation, that are associated with other ocular steroids. The first LE containing product, Lotemax®, was approved by the FDA in 1998. Subsequent gel and ointment formulations of Lotemax were approved by the FDA for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Durezol® is a topical steroid approved by the FDA for the treatment of inflammation and pain associated with ocular surgery. Durezol eye drops are dosed four times a day for two weeks followed by dose tapering based on patient response. The first generic formulations of loteprednol suspension 0.5% (Lotemax suspension) and loteprednol ophthalmic gel 0.5% (Lotemax Gel) were launched in May 2019 and February 2021, respectively, and the first generic version of Durezol was launched in September 2021.
The most commonly used ocular steroids, including Lotemax products and Durezol, are approved for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain with a three or four-times-a-day dosing regimen. This dosing regimen can be burdensome for patients as they are taking multiple eye drops following surgery, and a three or four times-a-day dosing regimen may reduce patient compliance with the prescribed medication. Other than INVELTYS, there is currently no marketed ocular steroid product with an approved twice-a-day dosing regimen.

INVELTYS Opportunity in Post-Operative Inflammation and Pain
We believe that INVELTYS has a favorable profile for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, including the following attributes:


● | Twice daily dosing. INVELTYS is the first and only twice-daily ocular corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. All other ocular corticosteroid products for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain are approved for dosing three or four times-a-day. INVELTYS has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the target ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. Given the generally accepted view that less frequent dosing leads to higher patient compliance, we believe the ability to achieve a significant reduction in inflammation and pain following surgery with a twice-a-day product is a key differentiating attribute of INVELTYS.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. LE is one of the safest topical ocular steroids available due to its unique pharmacokinetics. LE was designed to be metabolized after exerting its anti-inflammatory action in the eye. The metabolism of LE to inactive metabolites reduces exposure of the trabecular meshwork to the active steroid, thus reducing risk of IOP increase relative to other steroids. In our completed Phase 3 clinical trials, INVELTYS was well tolerated with similar increases in IOP, a common side effect of steroids, compared to placebo and with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed during the course of either Phase 3 trial. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our current estimates of potential future revenue from sales of INVELTYS are based, in part, on current prescription trends, anticipated changes in payer coverage, market growth assumptions and physician market research data we have commissioned that examines intent to prescribe. These estimates may be impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our commercialization efforts will depend on the length and severity of this pandemic and the impact on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted.
​
INVELTYS Clinical Development Program
In each of the two Phase 3 clinical trials of INVELTYS in patients who had undergone cataract surgery, administration of INVELTYS two times a day for 14 days achieved statistical significance for both primary efficacy endpoints of complete resolution of inflammation at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medication and complete resolution of pain at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medication. In each of these trials, INVELTYS was well tolerated with similar increases in IOP, a common side effect of steroids, compared to placebo and with no treatment-related significant adverse events observed during the course of either trial.
​
INVELTYS Customer Concentration
Three customers comprised 10% or more of our revenue attributable to INVELTYS during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These customers comprised 47%, 30% and 21% of our revenue, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 40%, 28% and 28% of our revenue, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020.

KPI-012 for Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects 
Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects Overview 
Persistent corneal epithelial defects, or PCED, is a persistent non-healing corneal defect or wound that is refractory to conventional treatments. PCED is a disease of impaired corneal healing and can be the result of numerous etiologies, including (but not limited to) neurotrophic keratitis, or NK, microbial/viral keratitis, surgical epithelial debridement, corneal transplant surgery, limbal stem cell deficiency, mechanical/thermal trauma and exposure 

13




keratopathy. Normal healing is a highly regulated multifactorial process that involves numerous biologic pathways and molecules, including growth factors, cell signaling, proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. In PCED, the normal healing process is impaired due to an imbalance of the key biomolecules that orchestrate the normal wound healing process. We believe that effective treatment of PCED across the various etiologies requires a multifactorial mechanism of action to address the impaired healing that is responsible for the defects.
​
PCED is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 100,000 cases per year in the United States and 238,000 cases per year in the United States, European Union and Japan combined. Clinical symptoms of PCED include pain, foreign body sensation, redness, photophobia and tearing. Clinical signs include non-healing epithelial defects, stromal scarring and stomal thinning. A PCED may lead to infection, corneal ulceration, corneal perforation, scarring, opacification and significant vision loss. 
​
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects
​
There is currently a significant unmet need for therapies to effectively treat PCED. Conventional therapies, which include bandage contact lenses, autologous serum and surgery, are usually ineffective in overcoming the dysregulation present in multiple cellular pathways that may need to be addressed to heal a PCED. Surgical procedures used in the treatment of PCED include tarsorrhaphy, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants and corneal transplants which are used to aid in restoration and maintenance of vision capabilities. 
​
The only currently approved prescription product in the PCED space is OxervateÔ, indicated for the treatment of NK, which we believe to be the primary etiology for approximately one-third of PCED cases. Oxervate contains a single growth factor – nerve growth factor (NGF) – and has been demonstrated to be effective in only the subgroup of PCED cases whose underlying etiology is neurotrophic disease. Oxervate is a topical eye drop that is administered six times per day at two-hour intervals for eight weeks. Each administration of Oxervate requires the use of a vial containing the drug product, a vial adapter, a single-use pipette and disinfectant wipes.
​
KPI-012 Opportunity in Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects 
​
KPI-012 is a novel, human bone-marrow derived MSC secretome composed of biologically active components secreted from the MSCs, such as growth factors, protease inhibitors, matrix proteins and neurotropic factors, that have been shown in preclinical studies by Combangio and others to facilitate corneal healing. KPI-012 is cell-free and produced from a proprietary cell bank. The drug substance for KPI-012 is produced as a chemically-defined cell-free solution followed by formulation and filling of the drug product in non-preserved single dose units. We believe that KPI-012’s multi-factorial mechanism of action has the potential to normalize the impaired healing in PCED and other severe ocular surface diseases driven by impaired healing. As such, KPI-012 offers a potentially promising approach for the treatment of PCED and other ocular surface diseases across multiple etiologies. Key biological factors contained in KPI-012 and their potential wound healing functions are shown below:
​

Key KPI-012 Components | Ocular Surface Wound-Healing Function 
Protease Inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, Serpin E) | Inhibit destructive proteases that degrade matrix in the wound bed 
Matrix Proteins(Collagen) | Build a molecular scaffold in the wound bed for cells to migrate and adhere to
Growth Factors (HGF) | Suppress inflammation and promote corneal epithelium repair 
Neurotrophic Factors (PEDF) | Promote maintenance of neurons to support corneal health 

​
The multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 is thought to be responsible for the significant wound healing activity observed in Combangio’s preclinical animal models and in the Phase 1b clinical trials. KPI-012 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA, for the treatment of PCED, and we believe KPI-012 should meet the criteria for fast-track and breakthrough designations.

Preliminary Clinical Development Plan for KPI-012
​
We are initially developing KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED. Combangio completed a Phase 1b clinical efficacy trial in nine patients with PCED in Mexico City. Based on the results of this Phase 1b clinical trial, we plan to submit an IND application to the FDA for KPI-012 and, subject to regulatory clearance, commence a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPI-012 for PCED in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our planned Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of KPI-012 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of various dosing regimens of KPI-012 in patients diagnosed with PCED. If the results of our planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPI-012 are positive, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we believe this trial can serve as the first of two required pivotal trials. If so, we plan to conduct an additional Phase 3 pivotal trial in PCED patients to support the potential submission of a BLA to the FDA.
​
Phase 1b Clinical Trial Results of KPI-012​
Combangio conducted two Phase 1b clinical trials with KPI-012 in Mexico City, Mexico during 2020 and 2021, one in 3 subjects without active corneal disease who were dosed twice a day (25 ng/mL FNE) for one week and another in nine patients with PCED, or the PCED cohort, who were dosed twice a day (25 ng/ml FNE) for up to 8 weeks. Key inclusion criteria for the PCED cohort included: 
​

● | Subjects with PCED of at least 10 days without improvement from one or more conventional non-surgical treatments in study eye due to any of the following:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | NK, provided there was no active herpetic infection of the eye in the prior three months
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Corneal Burns (alkali, acid and thermal)
--+-----------------------------------------


- | Post-photorefractive Keratectomy
--+---------------------------------


- | Post-corneal Transplant Surgery
--+--------------------------------


- | Corneal epithelial debridement resulting from Diabetic Vitrectomy Surgery
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Trauma
--+-------


- | Keratoconjunctivtis sicca
--+--------------------------


- | Sjogren’s Syndrome
--+-------------------


- | Corneal cross-linking
--+----------------------


● | Subjects with bilateral corneal burns could only have one eye entered into the clinical trial
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any previous treatment was stopped except for the study medication
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

The subjects were treated with KPI-012 topically twice a day, with the subjects in the safety cohort without active corneal disease treated for one week and patients in the PCED cohort treated between one to eight weeks. KPI-012 was generally well tolerated during both trials, with only one subject experiencing treatment-related TEAEs (mild and transient itching, red eye, and blurred vision after study drug administration). There were no deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events during either trial. One subject in the PCED cohort had to withdraw from the trial due to a protocol screening violation. 
​
As depicted in Figure 1 below, six of the eight patients in the PCED cohort (75%) who completed the trial achieved complete healing of the lesion after four weeks of treatment, with one additional patient experiencing some clinical improvement but not complete healing. Four of eight patients in the PCED cohort (50%) achieved complete healing of the lesion after one week of treatment and the other two patients achieved complete healing within two to four weeks of initiation of treatment with KPI-012. All six of the patients who achieved complete healing remained healed through the follow-up period of the trial, which ranged between eight to 19 weeks. Of the two patients who did not show complete healing in the trial, clinical investigators noted some clinical improvement in one of the patients (Patient 2-05), but the corneal staining images did not show complete healing of the defect. Patient 2-04 had a PCED in a blind eye which was perhaps too severe to respond to a pharmaceutical intervention. Patient 2-05 had a PCED that had existed for 871 days before treatment; corneal specialists have advised that it is rare for a PCED to have persisted for this duration and that it could be indicative of systemic disease.

The Day 1 images were taken on the first day of treatment, prior to first KPI-012 administration, with the fluorescein (green) stain demarking the corneal wound boundary of the study eye image. The Day 7 images were taken on the last day of KPI-012 treatment showing the PCED completely healed. The images on the left depict the study eye viewed under blue light to visualize the PCED with fluorescein stain. 
​
Significant pain relief was reported by patients in the PCED cohort within one week of treatment with KPI-012, as shown in Figure 2 below. Of the six patients who reported pain at the baseline, all six patients reported a reduction in pain after one week of treatment, four patients reported a pain score of zero after one week of treatment and all six patients reported a pain score of zero after three weeks of treatment.

​
KPI-012 Preclinical Studies and Results
​
KPI-012 has been evaluated by Combangio in a number of preclinical studies. In these studies, KPI-012 promoted rapid ocular re-epithelialization and mitigated scarring and neovascularization in a number of well-established animal models.
​
​
​
In vitro Human Corneal Epithelial Wound Closure Assay
​
The therapeutic mechanism of action of KPI-012 involves stimulating corneal re-epithelialization and ocular surface healing. Combangio evaluated KPI-012 in an in vitro wound gap assay developed using human corneal epithelial cells. In this assay, a mechanical defect (cell-free region) was introduced into a two-dimensional monolayer of epithelial cells to create a wound. The ‘injured’ monolayer was then treated with KPI-012 and the cell free region was monitored for wound closure as show in Figure 3 below. In this assay, KPI-012 exhibited a dose-dependent and potent wound closure response. 
​
​

A mechanical wound instilled to a corneal epithelial cell monolayer on Day 1 healed after treatment with KPI-012 (Day 4 of treatment), but not negative control (vehicle). Depicted images are wounded cell monolayers stained with Gentian Violet.
​
In vivo Mechanical Wound Studies of Activity 
​
Combangio also evaluated the activity of KPI-012 in a mechanical corneal injury mouse model. In this model, a circular area on the surface of the cornea was debrided (mechanically scraped) to remove the epithelial layer and create a circular wound. 
​
Topical formulations of vehicle or KPI-012 were administered twice daily to the wounded eyes. As shown in Figure 4 below, mice treated with KPI-012 exhibited prominent wound healing at day four of the treatment period, while the vehicle-treated wounded eyes remained largely unhealed. Further, treatment with KPI-012 resulted in reduced corneal haze and scarring relative to treatment with vehicle. Results of this mouse model suggested that at Day 4 of treatment KPI-012 promoted in vivo closure of cornea mechanical wounds relative to vehicle control. 
Figure 4. Representative images of wounded mouse corneas after mechanical injury (Day 1). Depicted is the fluorescein (green) stain, which demarks the corneal wound boundary. Treatment with KPI-012 rapidly healed the wound size (as indicated by the disappearance of the green stain by Day 4) relative to vehicle control-treated eyes.
​
A second confirmatory mechanical corneal injury mouse model study was performed according to the method described above using a different lot of KPI-012. The study yielded similar results, with KPI-012 promoting wound healing relative to vehicle as well as exhibiting dose-dependent potency dynamics. After four days of treatment, KPI-012 treated eyes exhibited more pronounced reduction in wound staining relative to vehicle-treated eyes, as shown in Figure 5A below, and after five days most KPI-012 treated eyes completely healed, as shown in Figure 5B below. Further, a KPI-012 formulation lacking key biologic factors known to mediate wound healing exhibited reduced healing capacity in the study, supporting the selection of KPI-012’s critical quality attributes. 
​

(A) Representative images of wounded mouse corneas after mechanical injury (Day 1) and after four days of treatment with KPI-012 or vehicle (Day 4). Depicted is the fluorescein (green) stain, which demarks the corneal wound boundary. Treatment with KPI-012 rapidly healed the wound size (as indicated by the disappearance of the green stain by Day 4) relative to vehicle control-treated eyes; (B) Treatment with KPI-012 resulted in more rapid complete healing and a greater percentage of completely healed eyes (dashed line), relative to vehicle-treated eyes (solid line).
​
Rabbit Tolerability Study
​
To evaluate tolerability of KPI-012, Combangio conducted a 15-day good laboratory practice toxicology study following ocular instillation of KPI-012 in rabbits. The purpose of the study was to determine the ocular and systemic toxicity of KPI-012 following repeated topical ocular instillation for 15 days. One group of rabbits was administered KPI-012 three times a day via topical ocular instillation to the right eye (the low dose) and another group was administered KPI-012 six times a day via topical ocular instillation to the right eye (the high dose), in each case with a one-week recovery period. The left eye served as a contralateral control and received vehicle at the same frequency as the KPI-012-treated right eye. All rabbits survived to the end of the study, and no gross lesions and abnormalities were recorded. There were no observed test article-related findings on body weight, intraocular pressure, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, ophthalmologic examination or ocular histopathology. The data of the toxicology study supported that repeated daily topical administration of KPI-012, at both three times a day and six times a day for 15 days, was well-tolerated and resulted in no overt toxicities in rabbits.
​
Other Potential Indications for KPI-012 
​
We believe the multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren’s Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis.
​
The wound-healing mechanism of action of KPI-012 also potentially enables partnering opportunities in chronic and/or severe indications outside of the eye such as diabetic foot ulcer.
​
Our Preclinical Development Programs
​
We are progressing a pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs, targeted to address both front and back of the eye diseases, including our TKI program for retinal diseases, and our SEGRM program. 
​
TKI Program for Retinal Disease
Retinal Disease Overview
There are a range of retinal diseases and conditions that adversely affect vision, including age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, diabetic retinopathy, or DR, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and retinal vein occlusion, or 

19




RVO. These diseases frequently result in damage to the vasculature of the eye, leading to poor function and/or leaking of existing vessels and often leading to proliferation of new, abnormal and leaky blood vessels in the back of the eye. These conditions can lead to retinal damage, scarring, and irreversible loss of vision.
Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is a degeneration of the macula of the retina that leads to impairment and loss of central vision. There are two categories of AMD: “Dry” AMD, which involves slow deterioration of the retina with submacular drusen, atrophy, loss of macular function and central vision impairment; and “wet” AMD, which involves the leakage of existing blood vessels often accompanied by the growth of abnormal and leaky blood vessels under the retina and macula, resulting in edema, tissue damage and rapid loss of central vision. If untreated, neovascularization in wet AMD patients typically results in significant vision loss and the formation of a scar under the macular region of the retina. Most cases begin as Dry AMD, which can progress to wet AMD. Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 55 in the United States and the European Union. The incidence of wet AMD increases substantially with age, and we expect that the number of cases of wet AMD will increase with growth of the elderly population in the United States.
The current standard of care for wet AMD is intravitreal injection of biologic agents that target VEGF, one of the key proteins involved in neovascularization.
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
DR is an ocular complication of diabetes involving changes of retinal blood vessels that lead to significant visual impairment. These changes include dysfunction of retinal vasculature (nonproliferative retinopathy), with vascular occlusion and increased permeability, leading to retinal hypoxia and DME. The disease can further progress to proliferative retinopathy with retinal neovascularization, hemorrhage and retinal detachment.
Among an estimated 19.8 million adults in the United States aged forty years and older known to have diabetes, the prevalence rate for DME is 3.8%, or approximately 746,000 people. DME is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in Americans between 20 and 74 years old.
Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)
RVO is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. The disease can cause sudden blurring or vision loss in all or part of one eye. RVO has been estimated to affect 16 million people worldwide.

20




Limitations of Existing Treatments for Retinal Disease
VEGF is a signaling protein that plays a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and increased permeability, two pathological processes that contribute to the vision loss associated with certain retinal diseases. Several TKIs have been investigated in AMD patients in clinical trials. These inhibitors have been administered in a variety of ways, including intravitreal injection, oral administration, and topical dosing. To date, no TKIs have been approved in the United States for the treatment of ocular diseases. We believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for a safe and effective VEGF receptor TKIs to treat various retinal diseases, such as AMD, DR, DME, RVO and related neovascular diseases.
The PDGF family of signaling proteins function through the PDGF receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, or RTK, that plays a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and fibrotic scar, two pathological processes that contribute to the vision loss associated with ocular disease. The combined inhibition of both VEGF and PDGF signaling pathways through their respective RTK are believed to be beneficial in treating certain retinal diseases. 
The most common treatments for retinal diseases involve administration of biologic agents that block the VEGF pathway and prevent or retard the blood vessel leakage and/or proliferation. Unfortunately, clinicians must inject these biologic agents directly into the eye via frequent intravitreal injections, or IVTs, to maintain vision. Sales of the two leading IVT biologic agents used to treat eye diseases associated with abnormal blood vessel proliferation, Genentech’s Lucentis® and Regeneron’s Eylea®, were $1.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in the United States in 20208. A new biologic form of Novartis’ Beovu® was approved in October 2019 and had approximately $200 million in worldwide sales in 2020. An effective therapeutic to treat retinal diseases with improved dosing regimen would bring significant benefits to patients.
TKI Program for the Potential Treatment of Wet AMD, DR, DME and RVO
Through our TKI program we have developed several novel, potent, and selective TKIs, including KPI-287, which can inhibit the VEGF pathway and the platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF, pathway. In vitro assays show that KPI-287 has a sub-nanomolar potency against the VEGF receptor-2 kinase and good selectivity against other growth factor receptor kinases, cell cycle kinases and other off-target receptors. We are developing KPI-287 via suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of various retinal diseases.
 ​
In preclinical rabbit studies, topical administration of KPI-287 achieved concentrations in tissues in the retina and the choroid well above the concentrations required for in vitro inhibition of 50% of the VEGF receptor 2 kinase activity. As shown in the figures below, the concentrations observed in these rabbit studies were higher than the concentrations observed in similar rabbit studies with topical administration of axitinib, which is the most common TKI currently being developed for retinal disease.

Tissues collected after a single topical dose 5% KPI-287 suspension vs 5% axitinib suspension in Dutch Belted rabbits
In addition, in a rabbit model of VEGF induced vascular leakage, topically applied KPI-287 reduced leakage to an extent similar to that achieved with an IVT injection of Genentech’s Avastin, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF. Avastin is approved as an anticancer agent, but is widely used off-label in ophthalmic diseases. In this model, vascular leakage of fluorescein was induced by IVT injections of VEGF. The extent of fluorescein leakage observed in various treatment groups was scored in a blinded fashion on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 

21




being no leakage and 4 being heavy leakage. As shown in the photographs below, the magnitude of the effect achieved with topical administration of KPI-287 5.0% was similar to that observed with IVT injection of Avastin. 
In addition, the magnitude of effect observed with KPI-287 was greater than the magnitude of effect observed with topical administration of axitinib in studies similar to those we have conducted.

Axitinib (5% q4 hr) or KPI-287 (5% QID) dosed topically days 1 through 6, with VEGF challenge on day 3, and efficacy evaluation (fluorescein angiography) on day 6 (72 hrs post VEGF challenge). IVT Avastin used as positive control.
We are currently conducting additional preclinical studies with KPI-287 administered via suprachoroidal administration to evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and efficacy over six months following a suprachoroidal injections. 

22




These studies are designed to evaluate the potential of KPI-287 for sustained durable delivery inhibiting VEGF induced ocular disease associated with vision loss.
We believe that an effective therapy with an improved delivery for patients with retinal diseases such as AMD, DR, DME and RVO will be a significant advancement in the treatment of these diseases and could increase patient compliance and reduce treatment burden in patients suffering from these sight threatening diseases.
SEGRM Program for Inflammatory Diseases
Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor can result in regulation of gene expression along both the transactivation, or TA, and transrepression, or TR, pathways. There is considerable third-party scientific evidence that the TR pathway alone may be sufficient for anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. Furthermore, we believe the TA pathway is likely responsible for the adverse effects associated with ocular and systemic administration of corticosteroids, including elevated IOP, hypertension, and osteoporosis.
SEGRMs are a novel class of compounds designed to selectively regulate gene expression through the TR pathway while avoiding or minimizing the TA pathway. As a result, we believe our SEGRM program has the potential for anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity comparable to corticosteroids while markedly reducing their associated side effects. We plan to study our SEGRMs for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases. Our SEGRM program is currently in the lead optimization stage, and we are aiming to identify a development candidate for the program.

Our AMPPLIFY Technology
Opportunities in Drug Delivery across Eye and other Mucosal Barriers
The body is surrounded by boundary tissues that play the important physiological role of preventing foreign bodies from penetrating into the body. The mucus that coats these tissues, the eyes, lung, cervical/vaginal tract and gastrointestinal tract, for example, serves as a protective barrier to trap and eliminate particulate matter, such as viruses, bacteria and allergens, before these agents can enter the underlying tissues and cause infections or elicit reactions. However, in playing this pivotal role of protection, mucus can also hinder medical treatments by limiting the penetration of medications to mucus-protected tissues, thereby reducing their therapeutic effect. 
Mucus also makes it difficult to treat many ophthalmic diseases. The body can rapidly eliminate drugs delivered to the eye via the tear film protecting the surface of the eye, which can significantly limit the effectiveness of these drugs. This is the case both for drugs designed to treat conditions in the front of the eye, such as dry eye disease and post-operative inflammation and pain, as well as for drugs designed to treat conditions in the back of the eye, such as retinal diseases. We believe that our proprietary MPP technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY technology, has the potential to address this clear unmet medical need for more efficient delivery of drugs. Our AMPPLIFY technology may have applications to other areas of the body that are protected by mucus, such as the lung, cervical/vaginal tract and gastrointestinal tract. We have demonstrated in preclinical studies that AMPPLIFY technology can be used to increase mucus penetration of over 15 classes of drugs. 
MPP Technology
Our MPPs are selectively sized nanoparticles, with average diameters of approximately 330 nanometers, and have noncovalent proprietary coatings. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus. We believe this enables enhanced efficacy at equal or lower doses as well as less frequent dosing for improved patient convenience and compliance.
In a preclinical study, MPPs or conventional particles in a hypotonic solution were administered intravaginally to mice. Ten minutes after administration, the vaginal tissues were dissected and stained. The image on the left below shows the distribution of the conventional particles and the image on the right below shows the distribution of the MPPs. The conventional particles aggregated in the lumenal mucus and did not reach the target tissues. In contrast, the MPPs coated the entire vaginal epithelium, including all the target surfaces.
​

Also, for ophthalmic applications, while a significant portion of conventionally formulated ophthalmic drugs are rapidly eliminated via the tear film, we have shown that our MPPs are capable of achieving higher concentration on the surface of the eye, thereby enabling the active drug substance to reach cells in the underlying ocular tissue at higher levels.
We aim to leverage our MPP technology, to enhance delivery of drugs into the eye. In preclinical studies, KPI-121 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and increased drug penetration into ocular tissues as compared to a branded form of LE. In a preclinical study of ocular inflammation in rabbits, KPI-121 0.5% administered four times a day, or QID, showed a larger reduction of inflammation as compared to a branded form of LE 0.5% given QID, as measured by the mean aqueous humor cell counts after intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide. We also administered either 0.4% KPI-121 or 0.5% branded LE to the eyes of two groups of rabbits. As illustrated in the line graph below, the concentrations of LE in aqueous humor, a transparent gelatinous fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers between the lens and the cornea, of the rabbit eyes treated with KPI-121 were more than three times higher than the rabbit eyes treated with branded LE 30 minutes after dosing, at a 20% lower concentration.

25




LE in Aqueous Humor
We administered KPI-121 0.5%, LE suspension 0.5%, or 0.5% of an LE non-MPP nanoparticle, to the eyes of three groups of rabbits and measured the amount of LE that was delivered to the cornea. The non-MPP nanoparticle was similar in size to our MPP nanoparticles but lacked the proprietary surface coating used in our MPP nanoparticles. As illustrated in the line graph below, concentrations of LE in the cornea of the rabbit eyes treated with KPI-121 were more than three times higher than the concentrations in rabbits treated with branded LE between 20 and 40 minutes after dosing. In addition, the rabbit eyes treated with the non-MPP nanoparticles had concentrations of LE similar to that in the rabbit eyes treated with branded LE and did not display the improved drug bioavailability properties observed with KPI-121. We believe these results highlight the importance of our proprietary MPP technology and show that KPI-121’s improved pharmacokinetic profile has the potential to reduce the dosing strength and/or frequency of administration of LE with KPI-121 as compared to LE suspension 0.5%.
LE in Cornea
We also have demonstrated the potential of our MPP nanoparticles to increase the mucus penetration of over fifteen classes of drugs. While our primary focus is in ophthalmology, in preclinical studies, our MPP technology has been effective in delivering drugs to the lungs, cervical/vaginal tract, gastrointestinal tract and other mucus-protected 

26




tissues. We have the ability to vary the rate of drug release as appropriate for the targeted disease state and tissue. As a result, drugs can be delivered either in rapid release formulations or as sustained release formulations that slowly release drug over a time period that ranges from hours to days.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our products compete, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete, with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012 and any other product candidates that we develop are the product or product candidate’s efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products.
Competition in Dry Eye Disease
The current disease management approaches for dry eye disease in the United States includes non-pharmaceutical therapies and pharmaceutical therapies. Non-pharmaceutical therapies include over the counter artificial tear eye drops, which are palliative and used on an intermittent or chronic basis to provide short-term symptomatic relief of dryness and irritation; hot compresses for the eye and lid hygiene management; devices, such as punctal plugs that are inserted into the tear ducts to inhibit tear drainage, resulting in more moisture on the surface of the eye.
Pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease include on label prescription drugs, including Restasis®, Xiidra®, CequaTM and Tyrvaya™ which are the only prescription pharmaceutical products other than EYSUVIS that are approved in the United States for use in patients with dry eye disease; off label prescription drugs, including topical steroid drops and/or other similar products, which are sometimes prescribed for treatment of dry eye disease; and various drugs that are produced by compounding pharmacies. Generic versions of Restasis have been available in the United States since February 2022. Restasis and Cequa are both topical cyclosporine formulations that are approved for increasing tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Xiidra is a topical anti-inflammatory therapy approved for treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Tyrvaya (varenicline solution) nasal spray is a cholinergic agonist that was approved by the FDA in October 2021 to increase tear production and treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 
EYSUVIS is indicated for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, which includes dry eye flares. Any product that is developed for the treatment of the signs and/or symptoms of dry eye disease could directly compete with EYSUVIS. There are several product candidates in preclinical and clinical 

27




development in the United States for the treatment of dry eye disease. These product candidates are being developed by pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies of various sizes, such as Aldeyra Therapeutics’ reproxalap ophthalmic solution, Novaliq’s CyclAsol and NOV03, which has been licensed to Bausch Health Companies Inc. and others.
Based on publicly available information, we have identified various other product candidates in clinical development for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease in the United States. If any of these product candidates is approved and such product candidate either effectively treats the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease or reduces the frequency of flares in dry eye patients, it could reduce patient demand for EYSUVIS.
Competition in Inflammation and Pain Following Ocular Surgery
Following ocular surgery, topical steroids are commonly prescribed to manage and prevent complications from post-operative inflammation. Topical steroid drops are the main competition to INVELTYS for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The current branded market leaders for topical steroids in the United States, based on revenue, are Lotemax® products and Durezol®. Generic topical steroid formulations consist mainly of products containing prednisolone, fluorometholone or dexamethasone. In addition, the first generic formulations of loteprednol suspension 0.5% (Lotemax suspension) and loteprednol ophthalmic gel 0.5% (Lotemax Gel) were launched in May 2019 and February 2021, respectively, and the first generic version of Durezol was launched in September 2021.
There are also non-topical formulations of ocular steroids that have been approved and/or marketed. Eyepoint Pharmaceutical launched Dexycu®, an intraocular suspension of dexamethasone for the treatment of post-operative inflammation, in July 2019. Also in July 2019, Ocular Therapeutix launched Dextenza®, an intracanalicular insert of dexamethasone, for the treatment of ocular pain and inflammation following ophthalmic surgery. There are also a number of companies in the United States developing products and therapies in preclinical research and clinical development for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, there are various formulations of steroids that are produced by compounding pharmacies and that are in drop form or are injected into the eye following ocular surgery.
Competition in PCED
There is currently a significant unmet need for therapies to effectively treat PCED. Conventional therapies, which include bandage contact lenses, autologous serum and surgery, are usually ineffective in overcoming the dysregulation present in multiple cellular pathways that may need to be addressed to heal a PCED. Surgical procedures used in the treatment of PCED include tarsorrhaphy, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants and corneal transplants which are used to aid in restoration and maintenance of vision capabilities. 
There is one approved prescription pharmaceutical product in the PCED space. Oxervate (cenegermin-bkbj), which was approved in August 2018 for the treatment of NK, a degenerative disease characterized by decreased corneal sensitivity and poor corneal healing, which we believe to be the primary underlying etiology of approximately one-third of all PCED cases. Oxervate is a topical eye drop that is administered six times per day at two-hour intervals for eight weeks. Each administration of Oxervate requires the use of a vial containing the drug product, a vial adapter, a single-use pipette and disinfectant wipes.
To our knowledge, there is currently only one product candidate in active clinical development for the treatment of a broad PCED population. ST266, an eye drop, is currently being studied in a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with PCED and is being developed by Noveome Biotherapeutics Inc. ST266 is a secretome produced from amnion-derived epithelial cells from donated full-term placentas. 
A number of companies are pursuing development of product candidates for the treatment of NK.
Competition in Retinal Disease
Several therapies have been developed to block the effects of VEGF by binding to and sequestering the protein. These include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Eylea, Genentech, Inc.’s Lucentis and Avastin, and Novartis’ Beovu. 

28




Avastin is approved as an anticancer agent, but is widely used off-label in ophthalmic diseases. All of these therapies are administered by intravitreal injections and must be regularly dosed for optimal efficacy.
In addition to the anti-VEGF therapies, there also are marketed drug delivery systems, or DDS, that are used to treat retinal diseases, notably: Ozurdex®, which releases dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, and is marketed by Allergan; Iluvien®, which releases fluocinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, and is marketed by Alimera Sciences; and YutiqTM, which releases fluocinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, and is marketed by Eyepoint.
There are several wet-AMD product candidates in clinical development, including those being developed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Kodiak Sciences, Clearside Biomedical, Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals, and Ocular Therapeutix. There are also a number of preclinical research programs being conducted by third parties to develop treatments for retinal diseases. We expect that product candidates currently in clinical development, or that could enter clinical development in the near future, may represent significant competition if approved. These product candidates may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies.
Competition in Ocular Surface Disease
Ocular surface conditions, which include dry eye disease, are currently treated with a variety of therapies, including branded and generic corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids are frequently used for the treatment of anterior segment conditions, including dry eye disease and for the treatment of post-surgical inflammation. Corticosteroids are also frequently used for the treatment of wet-AMD and diabetic eye disease as second line to the anti-VEGF therapies. We are developing our SEGRM program to be an alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases.
Sales and Marketing
In January 2019, we began commercializing INVELTYS in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force. During late 2020 and in 2021, we expanded our sales force, which now includes approximately 100 field-based commercial sales personnel. Our sales force promotes EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.
We have not yet established our own commercial organization or distribution capabilities specific to KPI-012. We believe that we will be able to commercialize KPI-012, if approved, for the treatment of PCED with a small, targeted, internal sales force in the United States and potentially other major markets. 
We expect to explore commercialization of EYSUVIS and potentially other product candidates, including KPI-012, if approved, in certain markets outside the United States utilizing a variety of collaboration, co-promotion distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial quantities or preclinical or clinical supply of EYSUVIS, INVELTYS or any product candidates, including KPI-012. We utilize our substantial inhouse expertise and know-how to develop and scale up our manufacturing processes before these processes are transferred to third-party contract manufacturers, and to understand and establish controls of critical process parameters. We also have personnel with deep product development experience who actively manage the third-party contract manufacturers producing EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and KPI-012 and plan to use such personnel to manage third-party contract manufacturers for any products that we may develop in the future.
EYSUVIS and INVELTYS Manufacturing
EYSUVIS and INVELTYS are currently manufactured at qualified contract manufacturing facilities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to FDA inspections from time to time.
We have supply agreements in place with these contract manufacturers to support commercial, clinical and registration manufacturing, release testing, registration stability, and labeling and packaging.

Woodstock Commercial Supply Agreement. In June 2016, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Woodstock Agreement, which we amended in February 2018, March 2020 and December 2020, with Woodstock Sterile Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC), or Woodstock, pursuant to which Woodstock has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Woodstock, a combined minimum amount of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS for commercial use. The Woodstock Agreement had an initial term of eight years from August 22, 2018, which is the date INVELTYS was approved for commercial sale in the United States. Pursuant to the March 2020 amendment, the initial term was extended through June 30, 2030. The Woodstock Agreement is subject to three-year automatic renewal periods after the initial term, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the Woodstock Agreement. The Woodstock Agreement provides for pricing structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of products ordered increases. Prior to the March 2020 amendment, we had annual minimum purchase requirements for each of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. However, pursuant to the March 2020 amendment, the annual minimum purchase requirements are now determined on an aggregate basis for the two products. We may cancel any purchase order under the Woodstock Agreement, subject to our minimum purchase obligations. Each party has the right to terminate the Woodstock Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Woodstock Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Woodstock with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Altasciences Commercial Supply Agreement. In October 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement, or the Altasciences Agreement, with Alliance Contract Pharma, LLC, which was assigned to Altasciences company, or Altasciences, pursuant to which Altasciences has agreed to provide to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Altasciences, bulk intermediates. The Altasciences Agreement provides for pricing structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of product ordered increases. Under the Altasciences Agreement, we will provide a forecast of orders for the quantities we believe we will require, and forecasted quantities will become binding at a certain point before the firm delivery date set forth in the forecast. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, the Altasciences Agreement has an initial term of ten years, after which it continues until terminated. Each party has the right to terminate the Altasciences Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Altasciences Agreement at any time for any or no reason upon sufficient advance notice, in which case we would owe payment to Altasciences for any firm orders and certain raw materials. The Altasciences Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Altasciences with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Chemo Iberica Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. In January 2017, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or the Chemo Agreement, with Chemo Iberica SA, or Chemo, pursuant to which Chemo has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Chemo, bulk supply of LE, with pricing structured on a per-kilogram basis. Under the Chemo Agreement, we will provide a forecast of orders for the quantities of LE we believe we will require, and we commit to purchasing 75% of the forecasted quantities. We can alter portions of a forecast at any time, except that, without Chemo’s consent, we cannot alter a portion of the forecast less than ninety days before the period to which such portion pertains. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, the Chemo Agreement has an initial term of seven years, after which it renews in two year increments unless either party gives notice of nonrenewal at least one year in advance. Each party has the right to terminate the Chemo Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Chemo Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Chemo with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
KPI-012 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for KPI-012. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of both drug substance and finished drug product for KPI-012 for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of KPI-012 if it receives marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for packaging, labeling, sterilization, storage, distribution and other production logistics. We have only limited agreements in place with respect to the manufacturing of KPI-012, and these arrangements do not extend to commercial supply. We obtain supplies of drug substance and finished drug product for KPI-012 on a purchase order basis and do not have long term committed supply arrangements with respect to KPI-012. 

30




Manufacturing biologics is complex, especially in large quantities. Biologic products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process. KPI-012 is a bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell secretome therapeutic composed of biologically active components, including protease inhibitors and growth factors, and is produced from a proprietary cell bank. The manufacturing process for KPI-012 is comprised of three stages: (1) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells from a working cell bank and production of unprocessed conditioned media (cell-free secretome), (2) production of drug substance as a chemically defined solution and (3) formulation and filling of drug product. While the drug product for Combangio’s early research and Phase 1b clinical trials was cultivated using a planar culture model, we plan to implement a bioreactor cultivation model for our planned clinical trials and for commercial supply of KPI-012. We are continuing the process of scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities with our third-party manufacturers to support longer term clinical development. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for bulk drug substance. 
KPI-012 drug product is manufactured from a vial of a working cell bank, which in turn was produced from a vial of master cell bank. KPI-012 master cell bank and working cell bank is stored in two separate locations. It is possible that we could lose the cell bank in both locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell bank.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of March 1, 2022, we owned 47 U.S. issued patents and 18 U.S. patent applications, as well as 90 foreign issued patents and 91 foreign patent applications (including Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications). We exclusively licensed a total of 38 U.S. issued patents and 14 U.S. patent applications, as well as 54 foreign issued patents and 26 foreign patent applications including original filings, continuations and divisional applications. Our patent portfolio includes the following patents and patent applications that we own or exclusively license:

● | 10 U.S. patents and five U.S. patent applications, related to our AMPPLIFY technology, and 34 related foreign patents and four related foreign patent applications, which are exclusively in-licensed from JHU, and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire beginning in 2025 through 2036.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, if permitted under the applicable laws, regulations, and rules and depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of any patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

License Agreements
The Johns Hopkins University
In November 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with JHU, which was amended in November 2012, May 2014, August 2014, June 2018 and July 2020 and amended in part in October 2014 by the JHU settlement agreement described below. We refer to the amended license agreement with JHU as the JHU license agreement. Pursuant to the JHU license agreement, JHU granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under specified patent rights covering various aspects of MPP technology, to research, develop, make, use and sell products and provide services in any field. JHU also granted us a non-exclusive license to use specified know-how with limits on JHU’s right to license the know-how to other commercial entities.
Financial Terms
In connection with the JHU license agreement, we paid JHU an upfront license fee in the low tens of thousands of dollars and issued to JHU a low single digit percentage of our common stock. We also reimbursed JHU for the prosecution and maintenance costs incurred by JHU for the licensed patent rights prior to our entering into the JHU license agreement, and we are responsible for all of the ongoing costs relating to the prosecution and maintenance of the JHU patent rights licensed to us. We paid JHU fees in the low tens of thousands of dollars upon entering into certain of the amendments to the JHU license agreement. 
In connection with the JHU license agreement and the JHU settlement agreement described below, we are obligated to make certain future payments to JHU. We paid JHU $112,500 in minimum annual royalty and running fees in the aggregate in 2021. We are obligated to pay JHU annual minimum royalties that will not exceed approximately $112,500 per year in the future. In addition, we must pay JHU a tiered royalty rate in the low single digits on annual net sales by us or our affiliates of products or services covered by a valid issued claim, or certain pending claims, of a licensed JHU patent right in the country of sale, from which we may, under specified circumstances, offset portions of amounts we must pay as royalties on other patent rights in order to commercialize a licensed product or licensed service up to a maximum reduction of a mid double digit percentage. We must also pay a percentage, in the high single digits, of certain consideration we or our affiliates receive from sublicensing rights under the licensed JHU intellectual property, subject to specified offsets and deductions. We may offset against each minimum annual payment the royalties and sublicense income that we pay to JHU in the preceding twelve-month period. We are obligated to pay JHU milestone fees not to exceed $750,000 in connection with the commercial sales of EYSUVIS in the U.S., and certain ex-US countries in the aggregate, if certain development and commercial events are achieved. We also are obligated to pay to JHU certain remaining milestone payments for the development of a third and fourth product under the JHU license agreement, which will not exceed approximately $1.7 million in the aggregate, if certain development and commercial events are achieved. The JHU patent rights sublicensed to us by GrayBug under the JHU settlement agreement described below are considered in the same way as the JHU patent rights directly licensed to us by JHU for purposes of determining these payments.
Diligence Obligations
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and introduce the licensed products and licensed services to the market, including developing licensed products suitable for different indications, consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment, and, after introducing a licensed product or licensed service into the market, we must endeavor to keep licensed products and licensed services reasonably available to the public consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment.
Term and Termination
The JHU license agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent in such country or, if no licensed patent issues in such country, then in November 2029. Either we or JHU may terminate the JHU license agreement for the other party’s breach that is not cured within specified time periods or if the other party is subject to certain bankruptcy protections. In addition, we may terminate the JHU license agreement, for any reason, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to JHU.

33




Assignment and Exclusive License
In April 2017 we assigned to JHU certain Kala-owned patent applications and our interest in certain patents and patent applications formerly co-owned by JHU and Kala, unifying ownership of the assigned patent rights in JHU’s name. As part of the assignment of these patent rights to JHU, Kala was granted an exclusive, non-royalty bearing, sub-licensable license from JHU under all of the patent rights Kala assigned in this transaction, which will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent under the new license. No fees were paid to JHU for this exclusive license.
GrayBug Vision, Inc. and The Johns Hopkins University
A dispute arose between us, JHU, and GrayBug Vision, Inc. (formerly known as GrayBug, LLC and GrayBug, Inc.), or GrayBug, over rights licensed to us and GrayBug under certain patent rights owned by JHU. In October 2014, we, GrayBug, and JHU resolved this matter by entering into a Settlement and License Agreement, which was amended in January 2015, which we refer to as the JHU settlement agreement.
Under the JHU settlement agreement, GrayBug granted us, under specified patent rights that are exclusively licensed to GrayBug by JHU in all fields, an exclusive, worldwide royalty-free sublicense in the field of use of a particle with specified characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material through mucus, mucin, or a mucosal barrier where such delivery does not involve administration via injection to the eye, which we refer to as the Kala sublicense field. In December 2017 and April 2019, GrayBug terminated its exclusive license from JHU as to two patent families among these patent rights. Pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement, these patent rights were to be automatically directly licensed to us under the terms of the JHU license agreement unless we specifically declined to accept such automatic direct license. While we did not accept the automatic direct license to one of the patent families as it does not directly relate to EYSUVIS, INVELTYS or any other potential drug candidates, we accepted the automatic direct license to the other patent family and are now responsible for all future patent prosecution costs for these patent rights. 
In turn, pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement we granted GrayBug, under specified patent rights that are exclusively licensed to us by JHU in all fields, an exclusive, worldwide royalty-free sublicense in the field of use of a particle with specified characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material to the eye via injection, excluding any particle comprising or consisting of LE, which we refer to as the GrayBug sublicense field. 
In addition, JHU granted us, under the terms of the JHU license agreement, an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain additional specified patent rights relating to further aspects of MPP technology in the Kala sublicense field. JHU also granted to GrayBug a similar license under these same patent rights in the GrayBug sublicense field. In January 2017, GrayBug terminated its license under all but one patent family in these additional specified patent rights, and in July 2017, GrayBug terminated its license under the remaining patent family. As a result, for those patent rights terminated by GrayBug, we are now licensed in both the Kala sublicense field and the GrayBug sublicense field. JHU also granted us certain rights to obtain a non-exclusive license to certain additional patent rights and, if we obtain such a license, we would have the exclusive right to negotiate for a specified time period an exclusive license under such patent rights in the Kala sublicense field. Under the JHU settlement agreement, we agreed not to exercise our rights under the JHU patent rights licensed or sublicensed to us to use a particular active ingredient. Each party to the JHU settlement agreement may sublicense the rights granted to it pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement, subject to notice requirements and the requirement that any such sublicense must involve some aspect of collaboration, joint research, development, manufacture, partnership or the like. In any event, sublicenses beyond a specified number of tiers are not permitted without the original licensing party’s written consent.
We, GrayBug and JHU each released the others, and certain persons affiliated with them, from any claims and losses known to the releasing party as of the effective date of the JHU settlement agreement in connection with the dispute that led to the JHU settlement agreement.
Financial Terms
The JHU settlement agreement also amended certain of our financial obligations under the JHU license agreement, which we have reflected in the description above. Neither we nor GrayBug owe the other any royalties, milestone payments or other payments with respect to the sublicenses and other rights granted to each other. In addition, 

34




JHU agreed that we are not responsible for paying to JHU any sublicense fees or other payments due under our JHU license agreement that may otherwise have arisen as a result of our granting GrayBug the sublicenses under the JHU settlement agreement.
For the specified patent rights directly licensed to us by JHU in the Kala sublicense field under the JHU settlement agreement, we reimbursed JHU for a portion of the patent prosecution and maintenance costs incurred prior to entering the JHU settlement agreement, and we are responsible for all of the ongoing prosecution and maintenance costs of any of these JHU patent rights for which there is no other direct licensee of JHU, such as the JHU patent rights licensed to us in both the Kala sublicense field and the GrayBug sublicense field.
Term and Termination
The JHU settlement agreement will expire upon the expiration of all the patent rights that are the subject of the JHU settlement agreement. We may terminate one or more of the licenses or sublicenses granted to us in the JHU settlement agreement on a country-by-country basis for convenience upon 30 days’ prior written notice to GrayBug. We or GrayBug may terminate one or more the sublicenses granted to the other party under the JHU patent rights if the other party, or its employees, officers, directors, agents or representatives, takes certain steps to oppose, attempt to invalidate or prevent the issuance of any of the patent rights directly licensed to the terminating party by JHU.
Stanford University 
As part of our acquisition of Combangio, we acquired Combangio’s exclusively in-licensed patent portfolio from Stanford University. In October 2019, Combangio entered into a license agreement with The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, which was amended in February 2020. Pursuant to the license agreement with Stanford, or the Stanford Agreement, we hold a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patent rights, or licensed patents, directed to methods to promote eye wound healing, to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products that are covered by the licensed patents, or licensed products, for use in all fields. 
​
Financial Terms
​
In consideration for that license, Combangio paid Stanford an upfront fee of $15,000. Under the Stanford Agreement, we are obligated to pay Stanford annual license maintenance fees in the low-to-mid five figures which are creditable against earned royalties owed to Stanford for the same year, an aggregate of up to $1.075 million for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, and an aggregate of up to $1.1 million for the achievement of specified sales milestones. Stanford is also entitled to receive tiered royalties from us in a low single digit percentage range of our, our affiliates’ and our sublicensees’ net sales of licensed products that are covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent. Our obligation to pay royalties will continue, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, until the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in the country of manufacture and sale. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Stanford a low double-digit percentage of certain consideration we receive as a result of granting sublicenses to the licensed patents and, in connection with our acquisition of Combangio, Stanford became eligible to receive a one-time change of control fee of $100,000. Stanford retains the right, on behalf of itself, Stanford Health Care, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford, and all other non-profit research institutions, to practice the licensed patents for any non-profit purpose. In addition, the United States government retains nonexclusive rights under the licensed patents to practice or have practiced the licensed patents by or on behalf of the United States government or on behalf of any foreign government or international organization pursuant to treaty or agreement. 
​
Diligence Obligations
​
Under the Stanford Agreement, we are obligated to diligently develop, manufacture and sell licensed product, diligently develop markets for licensed product, and use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain funding and development milestones by specified dates. 
​
​
​
​

35




Term and Termination
​
Unless earlier terminated, our exclusive license under the Stanford Agreement will continue until the expiration of the licensed patents. We may terminate the Stanford Agreement at any time for any reason by providing at least 30 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate the agreement if we breach certain provisions of the agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after written notice of such breach by Stanford.
​
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drugs and Biological Products
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates human drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. Biological products, or biologics, are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulated under the FDCA. The failure of an applicant to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may result in FDA delays or refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, and may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or civil or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities. The FDA must approve our product candidates for therapeutic indications before they may be marketed in the United States. For drug products, the FDA must approve an NDA. For biologic products, the FDA must approve a BLA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biologic in the United States must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated when certain changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the NDA or BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

37




Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides recommendations as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Reporting Clinical Trial Results
Under the PHSA, sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. The NIH’s final rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
Specifically, the PHSA grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to issue a notice of noncompliance to a responsible party for failure to submit clinical trial information as required. The responsible party, however, is allowed 30 days to correct the noncompliance and submit the required information. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is also a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. In addition to civil monetary penalties, violations may also result in other regulatory action, such as injunction and/or criminal prosecution or disqualification from federal grants. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS’s, long delay in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA did issue its first Notice of Noncompliance to a manufacturer in April 2021.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access. Sponsors are required, however, to make their expanded access policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.

38




In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA or BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug or biologic: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA issued guidance on March 18, 2020, and has updated it periodically since that time to address the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic. The guidance sets out a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical study report (or as a separate document) contingency measures implemented to manage the study, and any disruption of the study as a result of COVID-19; a list of all study participants affected by COVID-19-related study disruptions by a unique subject identifier and by investigational site, and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the study, among other 

39




things. The FDA has indicated that it will continue to provide any necessary guidance to sponsors, clinical investigators, and research institutions as the public health emergency evolves.
Interactions with FDA During the Clinical Development Program
Following the clearance of an IND and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with the FDA. Progress reports detailing the results of clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or completed at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program. Specifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND (Pre-IND meeting), at the end of Phase 2 clinical trial (EOP2 meeting) and before an NDA or BLA is submitted (Pre-NDA or Pre-BLA meeting). Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are three types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the FDA. Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an important safety issue. Type B meetings include pre-IND and pre-NDA/pre-BLA meetings, as well as end of phase meetings such as EOP2 meetings. A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a product, including for example meetings to facilitate early consultations on the use of a biomarker as a new surrogate endpoint that has never been previously used as the primary basis for product approval in the proposed context of use.
These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date with the FDA and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. For example, at an EOP2, a sponsor may discuss its Phase 2 clinical results and present its plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that it believes will support the approval of the new product. Such meetings may be conducted in person, via teleconference/videoconference or written response only with minutes reflecting the questions that the sponsor posed to the FDA and the FDA’s responses. The FDA has indicated that its responses, as conveyed in meeting minutes and advice letters, only constitute mere recommendations and/or advice made to a sponsor and, as such, sponsors are not bound by such recommendations and/or advice. Nonetheless, from a practical perspective, a sponsor’s failure to follow the FDA’s recommendations for design of a clinical program may put the program at significant risk of failure.
Manufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to 

40




be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product.
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. 
Expedited Review Programs
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of applications in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 


● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

41





be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

 ​
None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.
​
Acceptance and Review of NDAs and BLAs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product and the safety, potency and purity of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The fee required for the submission and review of an application under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2022 this application fee is approximately $3.1 million), and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $369,000 per eligible prescription product. These fees are typically adjusted annually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 calendar days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information; scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data, information or analyses needed to evaluate safety and efficacy or provide adequate directions for use; or inadequate content, presentation, or organization of information such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review”. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in 

42




the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.
In connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the applicant and set deadlines for responses thereto. The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant may incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Additionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS.
Decisions on NDAs and BLAs
​
The FDA reviews an applicant to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The term “substantial evidence” is defined under the FDCA as “evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the product involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.”
​
The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. This approach was subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1998 with legislation providing, in pertinent part, that “If [FDA] determines, based on relevant science, that data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, FDA may consider such data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence.” This modification to the law recognized the potential for FDA to find that one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence, including supportive data outside of a controlled trial, is sufficient to establish effectiveness. In December 2019, FDA issued draft guidance further explaining the studies that are needed to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. It has not yet finalized that guidance. 
​
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue 

43




either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA or BLA. This assessment is also informed by other factors, including: the severity of the underlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the premarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk management tools are necessary to manage specific risks. In connection with this assessment, the FDA review team will assemble all individual reviews and other documents into an “action package,” which becomes the record for FDA review. The review team then issues a recommendation, and a senior FDA official makes a decision.
A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the applicant an additional six month extension to respond. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA has taken the position that a CRL is not final agency action making the determination subject to judicial review.
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Under the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was signed into law in April 2021, the FDA must publish action packages summarizing its decisions to approve new drugs and biologics within 30 days of approval of such products. To date, CRLs are not publicly available documents.
Post-Approval Regulation
If regulatory approval for marketing of a new product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may 

44




in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a product’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the product is approved. After approval, a product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the FDA will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic.
In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe products for such uses not described in the labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Generic Drugs and Regulatory Exclusivity
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs and it also enacted Section 505(b)(2). To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, FDA has consistently taken the position that an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, a generic or follow-on drug application may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the 

46




applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosage forms, route of administration or combination of ingredients. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; rather, this three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active ingredient.
Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA; however, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
As part of the submission of an NDA or certain supplemental applications, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of a new product, each of the patents listed in the application for the product is then published in the Orange Book. The FDA’s regulations governing patient listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. Moreover, to the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
If the generic drug or follow-on drug applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new generic product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA owner and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA owner and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
​
Regulatory Exclusivity Governing Biologics
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021. The FDA has also issued numerous guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and licensing biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars under the PHSA, including a draft guidance issued in November 2020 that seeks to provide additional clarity to manufacturers of interchangeable biosimilars. 
​
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for a product that is “biosimilar to” a previously approved biological product, which the statute refers to as a “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the 

47




proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The biosimilar applicant may demonstrate that its product is biosimilar to the reference product on the basis of data from analytical studies, animal studies and one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
​
For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find not only that the product is biosimilar to the reference product but also that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product such that the two products may be switched without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. Following approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product, the FDA may not grant interchangeability status for any second biosimilar until one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar product.
​
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
​
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of exclusivity. For drug products, the six month exclusivity may be attached to the term of any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity, including the orphan exclusivity and regulatory exclusivities available under the Hatch-Waxman provisions of the FDCA. For biologic products, the six month period may be attached to any existing regulatory exclusivities but not to any patent terms. The conditions for pediatric exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new product in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patents that cover the product are extended by six months. Although this is not a patent term extension, it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the product for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and potentially market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on 

48




acceptable confidential requests. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first approved product. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.

If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of market exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the disease or condition for which the product has been designated. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation passed in December 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drug products that received orphan drug designation before enactment of amendments to the FDCA in 2017 but have not yet been approved by FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
In the United States, a patent claiming a new product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND involving human beings is begun and the submission date of the NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Companion Diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs and biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.

49




Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the therapeutic product and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND application alone, or both an IND and IDE application.
In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance which describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate. This guidance builds upon existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In its 2014 guidance, the FDA stated that if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the companion diagnostic’s intended use/indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather than specific products. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)). Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require pre-notification marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $374,858 and the small business fee is $93,714.

Healthcare Law and Regulation
Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50





● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing ·or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of drug and biologic products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for medical products and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select 

51




Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.

The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical Prices
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care. In addition, in October 2020, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.

On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs HHS , to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (1) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (2) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (3) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Federal and State Data Privacy Laws
There are multiple privacy and data security laws that may impact our business activities, in the United States and in other countries where we conduct trials or where we may do business in the future. These laws are evolving and may increase both our obligations and our regulatory risks in the future. In the health care industry generally, under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. HIPAA may apply to us in certain circumstances and may also apply to our business partners in ways that may impact our relationships with them. Our clinical trials are regulated by the Common Rule, which also includes specific privacy-related provisions. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that may be applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. State attorneys general also have authority to enforce state privacy and security laws. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
At the state level, California has enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business 

53




to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and individually identifiable health information. These provisions may apply to some of our business activities. In addition, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, already have passed state privacy laws and other states will likely be considering similar laws in the near future.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Review and Approval of Medical Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.

Clinical Trial Approval
On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public.
The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.

PRIME Designation in the EU
In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) or Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. 
Pediatric Studies
Companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s pediatric committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date.
Marketing Authorization
Marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, can be filed either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures, albeit through the Mutual Recognition or Decentralized procedure for a product to be authorized in more than one EU member state.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are part of the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

● | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The applicant may choose a member state as the reference member State to lead the scientific evaluation of the application.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State (which acts as the reference member state), in accordance with the national procedures of that
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

55





country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be progressively sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization produced by the reference member state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Conditional Approval
In particular circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14–a Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/5 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (1) the product candidate is intended for the treatment, prevention or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening disease; (2) the product candidate is intended to meet unmet medical needs of the patients; (3) a marketing authorization may be granted prior to submission of comprehensive clinical data provided that the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required; (4) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, and (5) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU n market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:

● | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

56





active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Pediatric Exclusivity
If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, or alternatively a one year extension of the regulatory market exclusivity from ten to eleven years, as selected by the marketing authorization holder.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, 

57




in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Patent Term Extensions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Reimbursement and Pricing of Prescription Pharmaceuticals
In the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments to those in the United States may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the U.S. and the EU, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, pharmaceutical firms may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of the product to other available therapies.
General Data Protection Regulation
Many countries outside of the United States maintain rigorous laws governing the privacy and security of personal information. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data , including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, and it imposes heightened requirements on companies that process health and other sensitive data, such as requiring in many situations that a company obtain the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relate before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that fall within the scope of the GDPR include providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, appointing a data protection officer, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. 
The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. Following the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the U.K. and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR.
