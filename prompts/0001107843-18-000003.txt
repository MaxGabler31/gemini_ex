Overview
We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology (IT) infrastructures, help protect their IT systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Our cloud solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Our integrated suite of security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys cloud platform enables our customers to identify their IT assets, collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, recommend remediation actions and verify the implementation of such actions. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions delivered on our Qualys cloud platform to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams.
IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving digital technologies intended to improve organizations’ operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based security and compliance solutions delivered in a single platform.
We designed our Qualys cloud platform to transform the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructures and applications. Our cloud platform offers an integrated suite of solutions that automates the lifecycle of asset discovery, security assessments, and compliance management for an organization’s IT infrastructure and assets, whether such infrastructure and assets reside inside the organization, on their network perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. Since inception, our solutions have been designed to be delivered through the cloud and to be easily and rapidly deployed on a global scale, enabling faster implementation and lower total cost of ownership than traditional on-premises enterprise software products. Our customers, ranging from some of the largest global organizations to small businesses, are served from our globally-distributed cloud platform, enabling us to rapidly deliver new solutions, enhancements and security updates.
We believe that our cloud platform provides our customers with unique advantages, including:

• | No hardware to buy or manage. There is no infrastructure or software to buy and maintain thus reducing our customers’ operating costs; all services are accessible in the cloud via web interface. Qualys operates and maintains the platform.


• | Real-time visibility in one place, anytime and anywhere. Our customers can conveniently see their security and compliance posture across their global IT asset inventory in one browser window, without plugins or a virtual private network (VPN), whenever and wherever Internet access is available.


• | Easy global scanning. Our customers can easily perform scans on geographically distributed and segmented networks at the perimeter, behind the firewall, on dynamic cloud environments and on endpoints.


• | Seamless scaling. Our cloud platform is a scalable, comprehensive, and end-to-end solution for the IT security needs of our customers. Our customers can seamlessly add new coverage, users and services after they have deployed our platform.

• | Up to date resources. Qualys has one of the largest knowledge bases of vulnerability signatures in the industry. All security updates are made in real-time.


• | Data stored securely. Data is securely stored and processed in a multi-tiered architecture of load-balanced servers. Our encrypted databases are physically and logically secured.

We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. As VM gained acceptance, we introduced new solutions to help customers manage increasing IT security and compliance requirements. Today, the suite of solutions offered on our cloud platform, which we refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps, includes: Asset Inventory (AI), CMDB Sync (SYN), VM, Continuous Monitoring (CM), Cloud Agent Platform (CAP), Threat Protection (TP), Security Configuration Assessment (SCA), Indication of Compromise (IOC), Policy Compliance (PC), PCI Compliance (PCI), Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Web Application Scanning (WAS) and Web Application Firewall (WAF). 
We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access our cloud solutions. We invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription. We continue to experience significant revenue growth from existing customers as they renew and purchase additional subscriptions. 
Our Qualys cloud platform is currently used by over 10,300 customers in more than 130 countries, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. Our revenues increased from $164.3 million in 2015 to $197.9 million in 2016, and reached $230.8 million in 2017. Our VM solutions (including VM, AI, SYN, CM, TP, Cloud Agent for VM, allocated scanner revenue and Qualys Private Cloud Platform) have provided a substantial majority of our revenues to date, representing 75%, 76% and 77% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We generated net income of $40.4 million in 2017, $19.2 million in 2016 and $15.9 million in 2015. Total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $537.5 million and $407.0 million, respectively.

Our Platform
Our cloud platform consists of a suite of asset management, IT security, compliance monitoring, and web application security solutions, which we refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps, that leverages our shared and extensible core services and our highly scalable multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. We also provide open application program interfaces, or APIs, and other developer tools that allow third parties to embed our technology into their solutions and build applications on our cloud platform.
Our cloud platform utilizes sensors, including physical, virtual and cloud scanners, and cloud agents that provide our customers with continuous visibility enabling customers to respond to threats immediately. It automatically gathers and analyzes security and compliance data in a scalable, state-of-the-art backend. The technology underlying our cloud infrastructure enables us to ingest, process, analyze and store a high volume of sensor data coming from our agents, scanners and passive analyzers, and correlate information at very high speeds in a distributed manner for millions of devices.

Our cloud platform is delivered to our customers via our shared platform offering from our global data centers, or via our private platform offering Qualys Private Cloud Platform (PCP) for customers or partners that want the platform to reside within the customer's data center. The PCP is a standalone version of our multi-layer, multi-tenant services architecture and is a fully integrated turnkey solution, making it more scalable, cost effective and faster to deploy within a customer's data center. Solutions delivered through our PCP are typically on the same subscription basis as solutions delivered through our shared platform. Our PCP utilizes hardware and software owned by us and physically located on the customer's premises. The customer is not permitted to take possession of the software or access the software code. Our PCP provides our subscription-based platform services to the customer using a virtual version of our software. This virtualized PCP allows us to extend our security and compliance solutions without the complexity and cost associated with deploying traditional enterprise software. Additionally, in 2016, we introduced the Private Cloud Platform Appliance (PCPA), an on-premises security and compliance solution packaged in a form-factor for medium-sized companies.
Qualys Core Services
Our core services enable integrated workflows, management and real-time analysis and reporting across all of our IT security and compliance solutions for our customers inside their organizations, on the perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. 
Our core services constitute dynamic and customizable dashboards and centrally managed, self-updating integrated Cloud Apps, through what we call a “single-pane-of-glass” user interface. Our interactive, dynamic dashboards and cloud platform allow our customers to aggregate and correlate all of their IT, security and compliance data in one place, drill down into details, and generate reports customized for different audiences. Our cloud platform’s powerful elasticsearch clusters enable customers to instantly find detailed data on any asset.
Our core services include:

• | Asset Tagging and Management. Enables customers to easily identify, categorize and manage large numbers of assets in highly dynamic IT environments and automates the process of inventory management and hierarchical organization of IT assets. Built on top of this core service is the Qualys AI framework, which is a global asset inventory service enabling our customers to search for information on any IT asset, scaling to millions of assets for customers of all sizes, helping IT and security personnel to search IT assets and maintain an up-to-date inventory on a continuous basis. 


• | Reporting and Dashboards. A highly configurable reporting engine that provides customers with reports and dashboards based on their roles and access privileges. 


• | Questionnaires and Collaboration. A configurable workflow engine that enables customers to easily build questionnaires and capture existing business processes and workflows to evaluate controls and gather evidence to validate and document compliance. 


• | Remediation and Workflow. An integrated workflow engine that allows customers to automatically generate helpdesk tickets for remediation and to manage compliance exceptions based on customer-defined policies, enabling subsequent review, commentary, tracking and escalation. This engine automatically distributes remediation tasks to IT administrators upon scan completion, tracks remediation progress and closes open tickets once patches are applied and remediation is verified in subsequent scans. 


• | Big Data Correlation and Analytics Engine. Provides elasticsearch capabilities for indexing, searching and correlating large amounts of security and compliance data with other security incidents and third-party security intelligence data. Embedded workflows enable customers to quickly assess risk and access information for remediation, incident analysis and forensic investigations. 


• | Alerts and Notifications. Creates email notifications to alert customers of new vulnerabilities, malware infections, scan completion, open trouble tickets and system updates.

Qualys Cloud Apps
Many organizations have an array of heterogeneous point tools that do not interoperate well and are difficult and costly to maintain and integrate, making it difficult for Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to obtain a single, unified view of their organization’s security and compliance posture. The Qualys cloud platform and its Cloud Apps help organizations escape this tool-fragmentation dilemma by drastically simplifying their security stacks and regaining unimpeded visibility across their IT environment. 
The Cloud Apps are self-updating, centrally managed and tightly integrated, and cover a broad range of functionality in areas such as vulnerability management, IT asset management, IT security, web app security and compliance monitoring.
Our suite of Cloud Apps currently includes: AI, SYN, VM, CM, CAP, TP, SCA, IOC, PC, PCI, SAQ, FIM, WAS and WAF. 
We believe that our applications are easy to use and provide our customers with a high level of control because our applications are part of one platform, share a common user interface, utilize the same scanners and agents, access the same collected data, and leverage the same user permissions.
Our customers can subscribe to one or more of our security and compliance Apps based on their initial needs and expand their subscriptions over time to new areas within their organization or to additional Qualys solutions. We offer three editions of our Qualys Cloud Apps: Enterprise for large enterprises, Express for medium-sized businesses, and Express Lite for small-sized businesses. 
Many of our customers use multiple Cloud Apps to develop a more complete understanding of their respective environment’s security and compliance posture. The Qualys cloud platform currently provides the following Cloud Apps to our customers:
Asset Management
Asset Inventory (AI): AI provides a complete, continuously updated inventory of a customer’s IT assets everywhere: on premises, in clouds or at mobile endpoints. It lists assets’ installed software, existing vulnerabilities and hardware details. A powerful search engine enables ad hoc queries and refines such queries. In addition to Qualys’ network scanners, AI leverages our Cloud Agents, which are lightweight, self-updating and run in the background. These Cloud Agents continuously enable the assessment of the compliance and security status of customer assets, including intermittently connected assets, without the need for scan windows or credential management. 
CMDB Sync (SYN): This certified application synchronizes AI data with ServiceNow’s Configuration Management system. Device changes are immediately transmitted to the Qualys cloud platform and then synchronized with ServiceNow. For customers, this means an end to unidentified and misclassified assets and to data update delays, all of which decrease chances of breaches. SYN provides real-time, comprehensive visibility of IT asset inventories enabling immediate detection of security and compliance risks.
IT Security
Vulnerability Management (VM): VM is an industry leading and award-winning solution that automates network auditing and vulnerability management across an organization, including network discovery and mapping, asset management, vulnerability reporting and remediation tracking. Driven by our comprehensive knowledge base of known vulnerabilities, VM enables cost-effective protection against vulnerabilities without substantial resource deployment.
Continuous Monitoring (CM): Built on top of VM, CM is a next-generation cloud service that can detect network threats and unexpected changes before they turn into breaches. Whenever it spots an anomaly in your network, it immediately sends targeted, informative alerts to the right people for each situation and each machine. CM tracks what happens throughout public perimeters, internal networks, and cloud environments - anywhere in the world. 
8

Threat Protection (TP): Thousands of new vulnerabilities are disclosed annually. With TP, customers can pinpoint their most critical threats and identify what they need to remediate first. TP continuously correlates external threat information against a customer's vulnerabilities and IT asset inventory, so customers know which threats pose the greatest risk to their organization at any given time. As Qualys engineers continuously validate and rate new threats from internal and external sources, TP’s live feed displays the latest vulnerability disclosures and maps them to customers’ impacted IT assets. Customers can see the assets affected by each threat, and drill down into details.
Security Configuration Assessment (SCA): A VM add-on, SCA expands our VM program with automatic assessment of IT assets’ configurations using the latest Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks for operating systems, databases, applications and network devices. SCA provides intuitive workflows for assessing, monitoring, reporting and remediating security-related configuration issues. SCA’s CIS assessments are provided via a web-based user interface and delivered from the Qualys cloud platform, enabling centralized management with minimal deployment overhead. SCA users can automatically create downloadable reports and view dashboards.
Indication of Compromise (IOC): IOC delivers threat hunting, detects suspicious activity, and confirms the presence of known and unknown malware for devices both on and off the network. From its single console, customers can monitor current and historical system activity for all on-premises servers, user endpoints, and cloud instances - even for assets that are currently offline or have been re-imaged by IT. IOC utilizes the Cloud Agent to capture endpoint activity on files, processes, mutant handles, registries, and network connections, and uploads the data to the Qualys cloud platform for storage, processing, and query.
Compliance Monitoring
Policy Compliance (PC): PC performs automated security configuration assessments on IT systems throughout a network, helping to reduce risk and continuously ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations. PC leverages out-of-the-box library content to fast-track compliance assessments using industry-recommended best practices. PC also provides a centralized, interactive console for specifying baseline standards for different hosts. By automating requirement evaluation against multiple standards for OSes, network devices, databases and server applications, PC enables the quick identification of security issues and works to prevent configuration drift. PC works to prioritize and track remediation and exceptions, while demonstrating a repeatable auditable process for compliance management.
PCI Compliance (PCI): PCI streamlines and automates compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements for protecting the collection, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. As an Approved Scanning Vendor, Qualys has been authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct the required quarterly scans. PCI scans all Internet-facing networks and systems with Six Sigma (99.9996%) accuracy, generates reports and provides detailed patching instructions. An auto-submission feature completes the compliance process once remediation is completed. 
Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ): SAQ automates and streamlines third-party and internal risk assessment processes, obviating the need to perform such processes manually via email and spreadsheets. SAQ easily designs surveys to assess procedural controls of IT security policies and practices. SAQ automates the launch and monitoring of assessment campaigns, making the process agile, accurate, comprehensive, centralized, scalable and uniform across an organization. SAQ also provides tools for displaying, analyzing and acting on collected data, enabling the assessment of compliance with industry standards, regulations and internal policies of third parties, like vendors and partners, and of employees.
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): FIM logs and centrally tracks file change events on common enterprise operating systems in organizations of all sizes. FIM provides customers with a simple way to achieve centralized cloud-based visibility of activity resulting from normal patching and administrative tasks, change control exceptions or violations, or malicious activity - then reports on that system activity as part of compliance mandates. FIM collects the critical details needed to quickly identify changes and root out activity that violates policy or is potentially malicious. FIM helps customers to comply with change control policy enforcement and change monitoring requirements.
9

Web Application Security
Web Application Scanning (WAS): WAS continuously discovers and catalogs web apps in your network - including new and unknown ones -- and detects vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Scaling up to thousands of web apps, it conducts incisive, thorough and precise scans, with few false positives. Its seamless integration with Web Application Firewall (WAF) enables one-click patching of web apps, including mobile apps and Internet of things (IoT) services. With WAS, customers can also insert security into DevOps environments by detecting code security issues early and often in the app development and deployment pipeline. WAS also scans, identifies and removes malware infections from customers' websites using behavioral and static analysis.
Web Application Firewall (WAF): WAF permits the reduction of application security cost and complexity with a unified platform to detect and virtually patch web application vulnerabilities. Simple, scalable and adaptive, WAF enables the quick blocking of attacks, prevents disclosure of sensitive information, and controls when and where customer applications are accessed. WAF and WAS work together seamlessly. Customers scan web apps with WAS, deploy one-click virtual patches for detected vulnerabilities in WAF, and manage it all from a centralized cloud-based portal. WAF can be deployed in minutes, supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and does not require special hardware.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to strengthen our leadership position as a trusted provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. The key elements of our growth strategy are:

• | Continue to innovate and enhance our cloud platform and suite of solutions. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to extend our cloud platform’s functionality by developing new security solutions and capabilities and further enhancing our existing suite of solutions. From inception through December 31, 2016, we have added the following solutions: VM, PCI, PC, WAS, WAF, CM, CAP, AI, SYN, SAQ and TP. In 2017, we introduced a number of new offerings, including FIM, IOC and SCA. 


• | Expand the use of our suite of solutions by our large and diverse customer base. With more than 10,300 customers across many industries and geographies, we believe we have a significant opportunity to sell additional solutions to our customers and expand their use of our suite of solutions. Since typically our customers initially deploy one or two of our solutions in select parts of their IT infrastructures, our existing customers serve as a strong source of new sales as they expand their scope and increase their subscriptions, or choose to adopt additional solutions from our integrated suite of IT security and compliance offerings. In this regard, we continue to expand our sales execution and marketing functions to increase adoption of our newly developed solutions among our existing customers. 


• | Drive new customer growth and broaden our global reach. We are pursuing new customers by targeting key accounts and expanding our sales and marketing organization and network of channel partners. We will continue to seek to make significant investments to encourage organizations to replace their existing security products with our cloud solutions. We intend to expand our relationships with key security consulting organizations, managed security service providers and value added resellers to accelerate the adoption of our cloud platform. We seek to strengthen existing relationships as well as establish new relationships to increase the distribution and market awareness of our cloud platform and target new geographic regions. We also plan to partner with such security providers that can host our Private Cloud offering within their data centers, helping us expand our reach in new markets and new geographies. 


• | Selectively pursue technology acquisitions to bolster our capabilities and leadership position. We may explore acquisitions that are complementary to and can expand the functionality of our cloud platform. We may also seek to acquire development teams to supplement our own personnel and acquire technology to increase the breadth of our cloud-based security and compliance solutions. In 2017, we acquired certain assets of Nevis Networks (India) Private Limited (“Nevis”), a company developing network security solutions for detection and awareness of external intrusions to computer networks. This transaction provided us with significant domain expertise in passive scanning technologies and allowed us to accelerate our move into the adjacent market of mitigation and response at endpoints. In 2017, we also acquired the assets of NetWatcher, allowing us to expand our threat protection and management capabilities and add new offerings to managed service providers (MSPs).

Our Customers
We market and sell our solutions to enterprises, government entities and small and medium-sized businesses across a broad range of industries, including education, financial services, government, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, technology and utilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 10,300 customers in more than 130 countries, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 70%, 71% and 70%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from customers in the United States. We sell our solutions to enterprises and government entities primarily through our field sales force and to small and medium-sized businesses through our inside sales force. We generate a significant portion of sales through our channel partners, including managed service providers, value-added resellers and consulting firms in the United States and internationally.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We market and sell our IT security and compliance solutions to customers directly through our sales teams as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners.
Our global sales force is organized into a field sales team, which focuses on enterprises, generally including organizations with more than 5,000 employees, and an inside sales team, which focuses on small to medium-sized businesses, which generally include organizations with less than 5,000 employees. Both our field and inside sales teams are divided into three geographic regions, including the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia-Pacific. We also further segment each of our sales teams into groups that focus on adding new customers or managing relationships with existing customers. 
Our channel partners maintain relationships with their customers throughout the territories in which they operate and provide their customers with services and third-party solutions to help meet those customers’ evolving security and compliance requirements. As such, these partners offer our IT security and compliance solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services and act as a conduit through which we can connect with these prospective customers to offer our solutions. Our channel partners include security consulting organizations, managed service providers and resellers, such as Deutsche Telekom AG, Fujitsu, DXC Technology, Insight Technologies, Inc., Optiv Security, Inc., SecureWorks Corp., and Verizon Communications Inc.
For sales involving a channel partner, the channel partner engages with the prospective customer directly and involves our sales team as needed to assist in developing and closing an order. When a channel partner secures a sale, we sell the associated subscription to the channel partner who in turn resells the subscription to the customer, with the channel partner earning a fee based on the total value of the order. Once the order is completed, we provide these customers with direct access to our solutions and other associated back-office applications, enabling us to establish a direct relationship as part of ensuring customer satisfaction with our solutions. At the end of the subscription term, the channel partner engages with the customer to execute a renewal order, with our sales team providing assistance as required. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 41%, 42% and 39%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by channel partners.
Marketing
Our marketing programs include a variety of online marketing, advertising, conferences, events, public relations activities and web-based seminar campaigns targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
We have a number of marketing initiatives to build awareness and encourage customer adoption of our solutions.

Our focus remains to attract engineering talent as we continue to add new solutions and improve existing ones.
Our development team works closely with our customers and partners to gain valuable insights into their environments and gather feedback for threat research, product development and innovations. We typically release updates to our solutions, including enhancements and new features multiple times a year, and we measure the quality of our scan results on a frequent basis in an effort to maintain the highest level of scan accuracy.
The modular architecture of our cloud platform enables our engineering teams to simultaneously work on different features, accelerating the delivery of new functionalities to customers. Our research and development team also works collaboratively with our technical support team to ensure customer satisfaction and with our sales team to accelerate the adoption of our solutions.
Research and development expenses were $42.8 million, $36.6 million and $30.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Manufacturing Agreement
Our physical appliances are provided by SYNNEX Corporation, or SYNNEX, pursuant to a manufacturing services agreement dated March 1, 2011. Under this agreement, SYNNEX manufactures, assembles and tests our physical scanner appliances. This agreement has an initial term of one year, which is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated (i) at any time upon the mutual written agreement of us and SYNNEX, (ii) by either party upon 90 days or more written notice, (iii) upon written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement or (iv) by either party upon the other party seeking an order for relief under the bankruptcy laws of the United States or similar laws of any other jurisdiction, a composition with or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or dissolution or liquidation.
Data Center Agreements 
Our data center operations are provided by large third-party data center vendors and are located in the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands and India. Our data center agreements have varying terms through 2020.
Competition
The expanding capabilities of our security and compliance solutions have enabled us to address a growing array of opportunities in the cloud IT security and compliance market. We compete with a large and broad array of established and emerging vulnerability management vendors, compliance vendors and data security vendors in a highly fragmented and competitive environment.
12

We compete with large and small public companies, such as FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Rapid7, Inc. and Symantec Corporation, as well as privately held security providers including Barracuda Networks Inc., BeyondTrust Software, Inc., Carbon Black, Inc., CrowdStrike Inc., Tanium Inc., Tenable Network Security, Inc., Tripwire, Inc. and Trustwave Holdings, Inc. We also seek to replace IT security and compliance solutions that organizations have developed internally. As we continue to extend our cloud platform’s functionality by further developing security and compliance solutions, such as web application scanning and firewalls, we expect to face additional competition in these new markets.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cloud-based security and compliance solutions include product functionality, breadth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership, scalability and performance, customer support and extensibility of platform. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors. However, many of our primary competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of February 23, 2018, we have eleven issued patents, several pending U.S. patent applications and an exclusive license to four U.S. patents, which was obtained in connection with our acquisition of Nemean in 2010. The inbound license remains in effect until the licensed patents are no longer enforceable, unless the applicable license agreement is first terminated by us or terminated by the licensor for a breach of the agreement or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. The licenses are currently exclusive and will remain exclusive so long as we make an appropriately-timed written election and pay an annual fixed royalty for ten years thereafter. These exclusive licenses are subject to the licensor’s reservation of certain rights in the patents and subject to the U.S. government’s reserved rights in the technology. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, as we have spent years designing and developing our Qualys cloud platform, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 869 full-time employees, including 384 in research and development, 206 in sales and marketing, 189 in operations and customer support and 90 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2017, we had 381 employees in the United States and 488 employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees in certain European countries have collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
