Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business segments: an Acute Care segment and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO segment, through which we operate a revenue generating manufacturing business in Gainesville, Georgia. We believe that we can bring valuable therapeutic options for patients, prescribers and payers, such as our lead product candidate, injectable meloxicam, to the hospital and related acute care markets. We believe we can create value for our shareholders through the development, registration and commercialization of injectable meloxicam and our other pipeline product candidates, as well as through the ongoing contributions of our cash-flow positive CDMO segment. In addition to our pipeline, we continue to evaluate acquisition, out-licensing and in-licensing opportunities.
Acute Care
 Our Acute Care segment is primarily focused on developing and commercializing innovative products for hospital and related acute care settings. Our lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam has successfully completed three Phase III clinical trials, including two pivotal efficacy trials, a large double-blind Phase III safety trial and other safety studies for the management of moderate to severe pain. Overall, the total new drug application, or NDA, program included over 1,400 patients. In July 2017, we submitted an NDA to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for IV meloxicam for the management of moderate to severe pain. In May 2018, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for IV meloxicam. In July 2018, we participated in a Type A End-of-Review meeting with the FDA to discuss the topics covered in the CRL. In September 2018, we resubmitted the NDA for IV meloxicam and the FDA has set a date for decision on the NDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of March 24, 2019. We believe that IV meloxicam compares favorably to competitive therapies in onset of pain relief, duration of pain relief, extent of pain relief and time to peak analgesic effect as well as that it has been well tolerated. We believe injectable meloxicam, as a non-opioid product, will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, excessive nausea and vomiting, constipation, as well having no addiction potential, while maintaining analgesic, or pain relieving, effects. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy for IV meloxicam.
 Our pipeline also includes other early-stage product candidates, including two novel neuromuscular blocking agents, or NMBAs, and a related proprietary chemical reversal agent and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine, or Dex, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that we are evaluating for possible partnering.
 Pipeline

CDMO
 Our CDMO segment leverages formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using proprietary delivery technologies and know-how for partners who plan to develop and commercialize these products. These collaborations result in revenue streams including manufacturing, royalties, profit sharing, and research and development, which support continued operations for our CDMO segment and have contributed excess cash flow to be used for activities in our Acute Care segment. We operate a 97,000 square foot, DEA-licensed manufacturing facility and a 24,000 square foot development and high potency facility, each in Gainesville, Georgia. We currently manufacture the following key products with our commercial partners: Ritalin LA®, Focalin XR®, Verelan PM®, Verelan SR®, Verapamil PM, Verapamil SR and Zohydro ER®, as well as supporting multiple development stage products.
 Our Strategy
 We believe that we can bring valuable therapeutic options for patients, prescribers and payers, such as injectable meloxicam, to the hospital and acute care markets. We believe we can create value for our shareholders through the development, registration and commercialization of injectable meloxicam and our other pipeline product candidates as well as through the ongoing contributions of our cash-flow positive CDMO segment. In addition to our pipeline, we evaluate acquisition and in-licensing opportunities, especially those that can contribute additional revenue and cash flow. Our near-term goals include:
 Complete regulatory approval of IV meloxicam. Our key 2019 goal is to receive FDA approval of IV meloxicam for the management of moderate to severe pain. In September 2018, we resubmitted our NDA to the FDA for IV meloxicam for the management of moderate to severe pain. The FDA accepted the resubmission for review and set a PDUFA date of March 24, 2019.
 Expand data supporting benefits of IV meloxicam.  We are currently evaluating IV meloxicam in a Phase IIIb program that includes clinical trials in colorectal surgery patients and orthopedic surgery patients. We anticipate continuing the Phase IIIb program in 2019.
 Commercialize IV meloxicam in the United States independently or with third-parties. We believe IV meloxicam targets a group of specialists which would allow for successful marketing and commercialization by a company of our size. Assuming approval, we are currently preparing for a U.S. commercial launch of IV meloxicam and are establishing sales management, marketing and reimbursement functions to commercialize IV meloxicam in the United States.
 Enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of IV meloxicam and other product candidates outside of the United States. We intend to pursue strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize IV meloxicam outside of the United States. We believe that our development expertise and unique product candidates make us an attractive partner to potential strategic collaborators.
 Leverage our development experience to progress our other pipeline product candidates. Our early-stage product pipeline includes proprietary product candidates for use in anesthesia (neuromuscular blockade and reversal). Our goal is to leverage our drug development expertise to develop these product candidates for use in hospital and acute care settings.
 Expand our contract development and manufacturing business (CDMO). We are focused on the growth of our CDMO services. We intend to seek additional product and related development partnerships through ongoing business development efforts, as well as possibly through expansion of our proprietary drug delivery technologies, and current and new manufacturing service offerings.
 Acute Care
 Our Acute Care segment is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and related acute care settings.
 Our Lead Product Candidate - IV Meloxicam
 Meloxicam is a long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities. Our proprietary injectable form of the drug, which utilizes NanoCrystal® technology, increases overall drug solubility which provides a faster onset of action of meloxicam and provides a rapid treatment of acute pain, which lasts for approximately 24 hours. 
Post-Operative Pain Market
 Based upon information from the National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100 million surgeries performed in the United States each year. Of these surgeries, we believe at least 50 million procedures require post-operative pain medication. Additionally, despite efforts to improve the provision of perioperative analgesia, the proportion of patients reporting moderate to severe pain after surgery has remained constant over the past decade.
 6


While opioids provide effective analgesia for post-operative pain, their use is increasingly limited due to the known side effects of nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, the development of tolerance and the potential for impact on addiction, misuse and abuse. Due to the potential for abuse, opioids are regulated as controlled substances and are listed on Schedule II and III by the DEA. According to a January 2016 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers (defined to mean opioid or narcotic pain relievers) increased significantly over the past 14 years and emergency department visits involved with misusing or abusing prescription opioid painkillers increased 153% between 2004 and 2011. In the acute care setting, and according to the Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert on the Safe Use of Opioids in Hospitals, opioid analgesics rank among the drugs most frequently associated with adverse drug events. As a result of the addictive potential and side effects, pain sufferers tend to limit their use of opioids, resulting in as many as 40% of post-operative patients reporting inadequate pain relief. This can reduce the quality of life for individuals and, according to an August 2012 article in the Journal of Pain, creates an economic burden estimated to be at least $560 to $635 billion a year in medical costs and lost productivity.
 Efforts to improve pain control with multimodal analgesia are being recommended by many medical societies as a way to decrease opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Multimodal analgesia, or MMA, refers to the use of two or more drugs or nonpharmacologic interventions with differing mechanisms. Its use has been demonstrated to limit the amount of opioids consumed and provide more effective pain control than opioids alone. Effective MMA may further lessen the cost burden and personal toll of opioid-centric regimens. According to an April 2013 article in Pharmacotherapy, opioid-related adverse events negatively impact patients and the healthcare system and cause a 55% longer length of hospital stay, 47% higher cost of care, 36% higher 30-day readmission rates and a 3.4% higher risk of inpatient mortality.
 We believe that IV meloxicam offers an attractive alternative for relief of moderate to severe pain without the risks associated with opioids. We also believe it can be an important part of an MMA approach for patients in the post-operative setting. Accordingly, we believe that physicians, hospitals and third-party payers, including Integrated Delivery Systems (IDNs), Medicare and Medicaid, are interested in new non-opioid pain therapies that provide effective post-operative pain relief without the adverse issues associated with opioids.
 IV Meloxicam Advantages
 We believe IV meloxicam has a number of advantages over existing analgesics, including the following:
 Does not cause respiratory depression. Meloxicam does not cause respiratory depression. Besides the addictive nature of opioids, we believe that medical practitioners are highly concerned with respiratory depression, which is a well-documented side effect of opioid use (all opioids, including morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone). Respiratory depression, which is defined by inadequate ventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels and respiratory acidosis, is an established outcome of opioid use and requires significant patient monitoring in the acute care setting. One of the more concerning adverse effects of chronic opioid use, for which tolerance does not develop, is respiratory depression during sleep, which can be life threatening. IV meloxicam has demonstrated through multiple clinical trials and patient use that it does not cause respiratory depression.
 Not a controlled substance. Meloxicam is not an opioid and not a controlled substance. Opioid therapeutics are currently controlled by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this act, opioids have been scheduled based on their potential for abuse and/or addiction. For those opioids placed in Schedule II, federal law prohibits the refilling of prescriptions, thus requiring patients to request, and physicians to write, additional prescriptions for each refill. Examples of Schedule II opioids include morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, hydrocodone and oxycodone.
 Duration of pain relief. IV meloxicam has demonstrated the potential to be an effective analgesic for up to 24 hours after a single dose in clinical trials. IV forms of ketorolac, ibuprofen and acetaminophen provide effective pain relief up to four to six hours, resulting in the need for four to six doses per day.
 Administration. We believe that IV meloxicam has an administration advantage in terms of being administered by bolus injection, whereas ibuprofen and acetaminophen can take up to 15 to 30 minutes to be infused.
 GI Tolerability. Unlike opioids, the mechanism of action of meloxicam provides analgesic activity with limited impact on gastrointestinal motility thus limiting the common unwanted side effects of opioids, referred to as Opioid Induced Bowel Dysfunction, or OIBD. OIBD comprises several symptoms including constipation, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, delayed digestion, abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, hard stool, straining during bowel movement and incomplete evacuation.
 Reduction of Opioid Consumption. Reducing opioid use inside and outside the hospital is becoming more of a priority for physicians and hospital administrators.  IV meloxicam has demonstrated the potential to relieve serious pain while reducing overall opioid consumption.  IV meloxicam also demonstrated a potential greater reduction in opioid use in patients over 65 years old with mild renal impairment in clinical trials.

Commercial Strategy
 If IV meloxicam is approved by the FDA, we believe that it may have a positive value proposition based on our current clinical data.  Based on our market research, a new analgesic would be perceived to have a strong value proposition if it can: (1) reduce opioid consumption, (2) allow ambulatory surgical centers to perform more complex procedures and discharge patients on the same day, and (3) allow hospitals to safely speed up patient discharge, reduce inpatient admission and/or length of stay.  
 If IV meloxicam is approved by the FDA, we are hoping to generate early commercial experience with IV meloxicam at settings that have lower barriers to new product adoption and have an appetite for use of newer therapies.  To accomplish this goal, we believe it is important to educate surgeons (e.g., orthopedic, colorectal and general) and anesthesiologists that practice at multiple settings of care within the acute care market, including ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, and hospitals (often referred to as the “hospital inpatient setting”).  We believe that ASCs may have lower barriers to adoption and be willing to consider newer therapies during our launch phase, based on our market research in this sector.  We also believe early success in commercializing IV meloxicam with ASC’s could lead to increased adoption of IV meloxicam in hospital outpatient settings, and ultimately hospital inpatient settings.  
 Overall, we plan to initially target approximately 1,500 hospitals and associated hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and 600 ASCs, which together represent approximately 12.6 million patients across all settings of care.  If IV meloxicam is approved by the FDA, we plan to build a sales force with approximately 80 to 100 representatives who would market IV meloxicam to health care professionals at our called-on institutions. In addition, we have medical, account-based and reimbursement teams. We believe this focused approach will help educate health care professionals, support formulary review processes and generate early adoption after launch with surgeons and anesthesiologists. 
 Clinical Development
 Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and analgesic effect of IV meloxicam. Based on the results of these trials, we believe IV meloxicam has the potential to be a potent analgesic used in the management of moderate to severe pain. IV meloxicam has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical trials, a large double-blind Phase III safety trial as well as four Phase II trials and additional pharmacokinetics/safety studies. Overall, we enrolled a total of approximately 1,400 patients in our Phase II/III programs. In addition, we are currently evaluating IV meloxicam in Phase IIIb clinical trials in colorectal surgery patients and orthopedic surgery patients. Per the Pediatric Study Plan Agreement with FDA, two clinical trials will be conducted in the pediatric population. These trials will be initiated following NDA approval of IV meloxicam and after appropriate regulatory and institutional review board, or IRB, review.
 At the end of July 2017, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for IV meloxicam 30mg for the management of moderate to severe pain. In May 2018, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for IV meloxicam, which stated that the FDA determined it could not approve the NDA in its present form. The CRL stated that data from ad hoc analyses and selective secondary endpoints suggest that the analgesic effect did not meet the expectations of the FDA. In addition, the CRL identified certain CMC related questions on extractable and leachable data provided in the NDA. The CRL did not identify any issues relating to the safety of IV meloxicam. In July 2018, we participated in a Type A End-of-Review meeting with the FDA to discuss the topics covered in the CRL, and we resubmitted the NDA for IV meloxicam in September 2018. The FDA has set a PDUFA date of March 24, 2019.
 Phase IIIb Clinical Trials
 We are currently evaluating IV meloxicam in a Phase IIIb program that includes clinical trials in colorectal surgery patients and orthopedic surgery patients to assess opioid consumption, pain intensity and length of hospital stay with associated pharmacoeconomic parameters.  We anticipate continuing the Phase IIIb program in 2019.
Phase III Clinical Trials
 Study REC-15-016
 In this pivotal clinical trial, evaluating pain relief over a 48-hour period in a hard tissue, post-operative pain model (bunionectomy), IV meloxicam achieved the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference in Summed Pain Intensity Difference, or SPID, over the first 48 hours, or SPID48, compared to placebo. This was a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, multi-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating IV meloxicam in the management of post-operative pain following bunionectomy surgery. Two hundred and one patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive either IV meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo once daily for up to three days. Following the beginning of treatment, patients remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Patients were followed for 28 days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to all patients, if required. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate pain relief over a 48-hour period of IV meloxicam when administered as a bolus injection.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was SPID48, utilizing a windowed 2-hour last observation carried forward, or W2LOCF, analysis method. Secondary efficacy endpoints included use of opioid rescue medication, SPIDs over various time intervals, and patient global assessment, or PGA, of pain control. The IV meloxicam treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID48 (p=0.0034) compared to the placebo arm (Figure 1).
 Figure 1: SPID48


The study also achieved the majority of secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID6 (p=0.0153), SPID12 (p=0.0053), SPID24 (p=0.0084), SPID24-48 (p=0.0050), time to first use of rescue medication (p=0.0076), and several other rescue use and pain relief metrics during the first 48 hours, compared to placebo. Times to Perceptible and Meaningful Pain Relief, % Subjects with >50% Improvement within 6 Hours, and PGA of Pain Control at 24 hours were not significantly different between treatment groups.
 The safety results demonstrated that IV meloxicam was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or bleeding events in the IV meloxicam-treated patients. The most common adverse events, or AEs, occurring in at least 3% of IV meloxicam-treated patients, were nausea, headache, pruritus, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, flushing and somnolence, and the incidence of these AEs was generally comparable to the placebo group. The IV meloxicam-treated patients experienced injection site pain and injection site erythema at a rate comparable to placebo. The majority of treatment emergent AEs, or TEAEs, were mild in nature and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or ECGs, or clinical lab assessments.
 
Study REC-15-015
 In the second of our two Phase III pivotal clinical trials, evaluating pain relief over a 24-hour period in a soft tissue, post-operative pain model (abdominoplasty), IV meloxicam achieved the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference in SPID over the first 24 hours, or SPID24, compared to placebo. This was a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, multi-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating IV meloxicam in the management of post-operative pain following abdominoplasty surgery. Two hundred nineteen patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive either IV meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo once daily for up to three days. Following the beginning of treatment, patients remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Patients were followed for 28 days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to all patients, if required. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate pain relief over a 24-hour period of IV meloxicam when administered as a bolus injection (over 15-30 seconds).
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was SPID24 (0-24), utilizing a W2LOCF analysis method. Secondary efficacy endpoints included use of opioid rescue medication, SPIDs over various time intervals, time to pain relief and PGA of pain control. The IV meloxicam treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID24 (p=0.0145) compared to the placebo arm (Figure 2).

Figure 2: SPID24

The study also achieved statistical significance for 10 of the secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID12 (p=0.0434), time to perceptible pain relief (p=0.0050), subjects with ≥30% improvement at 24 hours (p=0.0178), number of times patients required rescue in the first 24 hours after randomization (p=0.0275), as well as number of times rescued from 24 to 48 hours (p=0.0009), and several other pain relief metrics, compared to placebo.
 
SPID6, Times to Meaningful Pain Relief and First Rescue, Number of Subjects rescued 0-24 and 0-48 hours, % Subjects with ≥30 and ≥50% Improvement within 6 Hours and ≥50% within 24 hours, and PGA of Pain Control at 24 hours were not significantly different between treatment groups.
 The safety results demonstrated that IV meloxicam was well tolerated with no difference in SAEs related to bleeding for IV meloxicam treated patients versus placebo (1 each). There were two additional SAEs observed in the placebo group. The most common (at least 3% in the IV meloxicam group) AEs were nausea, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. The incidence of these events was lower than those observed in the placebo group. The majority of AEs were mild in nature and one patient in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an adverse event of post-procedural bleeding. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in vital signs, ECGs or clinical lab assessments.
 Safety Study
 IV meloxicam has also successfully completed a double-blind, randomized Phase III safety study evaluating IV meloxicam (30mg bolus injection) or placebo following major surgery. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV meloxicam 30mg vs. placebo through Day 28 following treatment. The clinical trial demonstrated that the adverse event profile of IV meloxicam 30mg was consistent with previously completed clinical trials and was similar to placebo reported events. 
 This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial and included patients who had undergone major elective surgical procedures which were expected to result in hospitalization for at least 24-48 hours. Major surgical procedures included total hip and knee replacements, spinal, GI, hernia repair, and gynecologic surgeries, as well as a range of other surgeries. Patient demographics were balanced across treatment groups and included 40% male patients and about 23% of patients who were over age 65. Unlike the pivotal efficacy trials, minimum pain scores were not required for treatment. Sites were permitted to use opioids and other pain management modes according to their “standard of care” and meloxicam or placebo was added to this regimen in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either IV meloxicam 30mg or IV placebo daily for up to 7 doses. A total of 721 patients received at least one dose of study medication.

10


The most common (≥3%) AEs observed in the IV meloxicam 30mg treatment group (n=538) are listed in the table below:
  
 | IV Meloxicam | 
-------------------------------------------+---------------+----
Preferred Term | 30 mg N = 538 | | | Placebo N = 183 | 
Subjects with ≥1 AE | | 339 | (63.0) | | 119 | (65.0)
Nausea | | 123 | (22.9) | | 51 | (27.9)
Constipation | | 51 | (9.5) | | 17 | (9.3) 
Vomiting | | 27 | (5.0) | | 14 | (7.7) 
Pruritis | | 21 | (3.9) | | 10 | (5.5) 
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased | | 21 | (3.9) | | 5 | (2.7) 
Headache | | 20 | (3.7) | | 12 | (6.6) 
Anemia | | 18 | (3.3) | | 4 | (2.2) 

 In patients age 65 and over, the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE was approximately 7% less in the IV meloxicam 30mg treatment arm compared to the placebo arm. The total occurrence of patients with at least one SAE was observed to be lower in the IV meloxicam 30mg group, 2.6%, than in the placebo group, 5.5%. In this safety study only two SAE events were listed as possibly related to study treatment. Both of these SAEs occurred in one placebo treated patient. No deaths were reported in either treatment group. Approximately 3% of patients in each study group discontinued. 
 There were no meaningful clinical differences between treatment groups in vital signs, ECGs, clinical lab assessments and surgeon satisfaction with wound healing. Overall there was low incidence of clinically significant wound healing abnormalities, as scored by the primary investigator, in both treatment groups (~2%). The meloxicam group had 4/538 patients with more than one attribute scored “clinically significant”, while in placebo, 1/183 patients were scored “clinically significant” for only one attribute. 
 
In addition, mean opioid consumption for the total population was lower in the IV meloxicam 30mg group compared with placebo at all evaluated intervals; Hour 0-24, Hour 24-48, Hour 48-72 and Hour 0-72 intervals, or the full treatment period. There was also a significant increase in time to first use of opioids in the IV meloxicam 30mg treatment arm, compared to placebo.  Mean opioid consumption in the IV meloxicam group was lower than the placebo group at all evaluated intervals in the subgroups of Orthopedic Surgeries, Total Knee Replacements, and subjects >65 years with Mild Renal Impairment, as depicted in the table below.

Our Other Pipeline Candidates
 While our current priority is the commercialization of IV meloxicam, our pipeline also includes other earlier stage product candidates including intermediate and short-acting NMBAs, and accompanying reversal agents, DEX-IN, along with other product candidates that we may choose to develop for use in hospital or related settings.   

11


NMBAs
 Neuromuscular blocking agents are used as muscle paralyzing agents to facilitate intubation and surgery. We are developing an intermediate-acting NMBA, RP1000, an ultrashort-acting NMBA, RP2000, and a reversal agent specific to our NMBAs.  The table below summarizes the predicted onset and duration of activity for each NMBA based on currently available data, as well as the development status of each NMBA:
  
Compound | Onset Time | Duration of Activity | Status 
---------+------------+----------------------+-------------
RP1000 | Rapid | Intermediate acting | Phase I 
RP2000 | Rapid | Ultra-short acting | Pre-clinical

 
In animal models, the proprietary reversal agent acts quickly by chemical reaction to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. We believe that the NMBAs can reduce the time required for induction of anesthesia and the reversal agent can reduce the time needed to recover from NMBA dosing post-procedure, while potentially enhancing patient safety and resulting in cost savings for the hospital or other provider. RP1000, the intermediate-acting NMBA, and the reversal agent were subject to a clinical hold imposed by the FDA due to need for additional toxicity data at higher dose exposures. We have met with the FDA and the clinical hold has been lifted with respect to RP1000. We continue to work with the FDA regarding a path forward for the reversal agent. We expect to submit a new IND for RP1000 in 2019.  
 We have a worldwide, exclusive license to the NMBAs and the related reversal agent from Cornell University.  
 Dex-IN
 Dex (dexmedetomidine) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has demonstrated sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. Dex has an extensive commercial history of safe IV use. We have formulated Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of Dex, at a significantly lower dose (approximately as low as 1/10th) than the currently recommended IV dosage levels used for clinical sedation. Based upon our lower dose, we have seen minimal sedation to date in our clinical trials while still demonstrating an analgesic effect.
 We continue to explore possible uses of Dex-IN in other indications in the Acute Care space as well as pursue possible partnering opportunities. 
 CDMO Segment
 Through our contract development and manufacturing, CDMO, segment, we leverage our formulation and development expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using proprietary delivery technologies and know-how for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation, product development from formulation through commercial manufacturing, and specialized capabilities for solid oral dosage forms, extended release and controlled substance manufacturing, as well as high potency development and manufacturing. In a typical collaboration, we work with our commercial partners to develop product candidates, or new formulations of existing product candidates, and may license certain intellectual property to such commercial partners. We also typically exclusively manufacture and supply clinical and commercial supplies of these proprietary products and product candidates. These collaborations may result in revenue streams including from manufacturing, royalties, profit sharing, and research and development, which support continued operations for our CDMO segment as well as provide free cash flow to support research and development of proprietary product candidates in our Acute Care segment.

The table below details the key products developed and/or manufactured with our key commercial partners:
 
 
Product | Indication | Territory | Revenue | Commercial | Agreement term 
--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
 | | | Source | Partner | 
Ritalin LA® | Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder | Worldwide | Manufacturing | Novartis Pharma AG | Through December 31, 2023 
Focalin XR® | Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder | Worldwide, except Canada | Manufacturing | Novartis Pharma AG | Through December 31, 2023 
Verelan PM®, SR & Verapamil PM | Hypertension | United States | Profit Sharing / Manufacturing | Lannett Company, Inc. | Through December 31, 2021 
Verapamil SR | Hypertension | United States | Profit Sharing / Manufacturing | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. | Annual renewals on a calendar year basis
Zohydro ER® | Severe Pain | United States | Royalty / Manufacturing | Pernix Therapeutics, Inc. | Through March 2029 

 
In addition to these key products, we also develop and manufacture other development stage products. The manufacture of these products for clinical trials and commercial use is subject to cGMPs and other regulatory agency regulations. We own and operate a 97,000 square foot, DEA-licensed manufacturing facility in Gainesville, Georgia, which has been inspected by U.S., EU, Turkish and Brazilian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing and lease a 24,000 square foot development and high potency facility, also in Gainesville, Georgia. 
 With each product, we either purchase active drug substance from third parties or receive it from our partners to formulate product using our technologies. Although some materials for our products are currently available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources, we attempt to acquire an adequate inventory of such materials, establish alternative sources and/or negotiate long-term supply arrangements. We do not currently have any significant issues finding suppliers. However, there is no certainty that we will be able to obtain long-term supplies of our manufacturing materials in the future.
 On February 8, 2019
, we entered into new five-year manufacturing and supply agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, referred to as the 2019 Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the 2019 Novartis Agreement, we will continue to be the exclusive supplier to Novartis of Ritalin LA and Focalin XR through December 31, 2023.  We previously supplied Ritalin LA and Focalin XR through two separate supply agreements, which included two revenue components, product manufacturing revenue and royalty revenue; the 2019 Novartis Agreement combines the supply of Ritalin LA and Focalin XR into one agreement, which provides product manufacturing revenue that is expected to provide similar total revenue per capsule economics as did the two prior revenue components combined.
 Permits and Regulatory Approvals
 We hold various licenses for our CDMO segment manufacturing activities. The primary licenses held are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishments and DEA Controlled Substance Registration. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses for distribution activities throughout certain states. We also hold cGMP certifications for EU importation of products made in Gainesville for sale in the EU and an ANVISA certification for sale in Brazil.
 In certain of our commercial partnerships, our commercial partner is the product authorization holder for products that have been developed on behalf of the commercial partner. In other commercial partnerships, we are the authorization holder.  When our commercial partner holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, we support this authorization by furnishing a letter of reference to the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, manufacturing and related data to the relevant regulator or sponsor to provide adequate manufacturing support in respect of the product. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator.
 We hold the approved NDAs for Verelan and Verapamil, which we license to Lanett Company, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., respectively.

Customer Agreements
 We are party to agreements with each of our commercial partners governing the development, formulation and/or supply services we provide, as well as any applicable intellectual property licenses. Each commercial partner generally remains responsible for distributing, marketing and promoting their respective products. These collaborations result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, etc., which support continued operations for our CDMO segment and have contributed funds to be used in our research and development and pre-commercialization activities in our Acute Care segment. We are dependent on a small number of commercial partners, with our four largest customers (Novartis Pharma AG, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Pernix Therapeutics, Inc., or Pernix, and Lannett Company, Inc.) having generated 99% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, of which Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. generated 48% of our revenue under one customer agreement, and Novartis Pharma AG, generated 38% of our revenue combined under two separate customer agreements, which effective January 1, 2019 is combined into one agreement.
Intellectual Property
 Acute Care
 We own patents and patent applications for injectable meloxicam, that cover compositions, including compositions produced using NanoCrystal® technology, method of making and method of treating. These issued patents expire in 2022 in the United States. We also in-license from Alkermes, on a perpetual, royalty-free basis, composition and methods of making patents, one of which we anticipate to be Orange-Book listable, and patent applications (specifically directed to the prevention of flake like aggregates), which expire in 2030.
 We license the patents and other intellectual property covering the NMBAs and the related reversal agent under a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license from Cornell University.  Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay Cornell University (i) an annual license maintenance fee payment until the first commercial sale of a licensed compound; (ii) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, up to a maximum, for each NMBA, of $5 million for U.S. regulatory approval and commercialization milestones and $3 million for European regulatory approval and commercialization milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of the NMBAs and the related reversal agent at rates ranging from low to mid-single digits, depending on the applicable licensed compound and whether there is a valid patent claim in the applicable country, subject to an annual minimum royalty amount. In addition, we will reimburse Cornell University for past and ongoing patent costs related to prosecution and maintenance of the patents related to the licensed compounds.  The license agreement is terminable by us at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and by Cornell University upon our material breach, subject to a cure period, and upon our filing any claim asserting the invalidity of any of Cornell University’s licensed patent rights. The royalty term for each licensed compound expires, on a country-by-country basis, on the later of (i) the expiration date of the longest-lived licensed patent, (ii) the expiration of any granted statutory period of marketing exclusivity, or (iii) the first commercial sale of a generic equivalent of the applicable licensed compound. On the last to expire royalty term the license agreement will automatically convert to a royalty-free nonexclusive license.
 We hold patent applications directed to the analgesia indication, formulations and intranasal and transmucosal methods of use of Dex, and we are progressing through the patent application process globally, including the United States. Several patent applications have issued as patents outside the United States for transmucosal methods, and the resulting patent protection will last into 2030, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. In addition, a patent related to intranasal methods has issued in the United States, and the resulting patent protection will last into 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. 
 We are party to an exclusive license with Orion for the development and commercialization of Dex for use in the treatment of pain in humans in any dosage form for transdermal, transmucosal (including sublingual and intranasal), topical, enteral or pulmonary (inhalational) delivery, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion, worldwide, except for Europe, Turkey, and the CIS (currently includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan), referred to herein as the Territory. We have the right to sublicense the rights under such license at any time. We are required to pay Orion lump sum payments on the achievement of certain developmental milestones and upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones, as well as a royalty on net sales during the term, which varies from 10% to 20% depending on annual sales levels. 
 
CDMO Segment
 We own various controlled release formulation patents, including patents in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Brazil, related to our proprietary delivery technologies that we utilize in our drug development, formulation and manufacturing business through our CDMO segment. These patents are scheduled to expire between 2019 and 2026. We own patents and patent applications in the United States and Canada directed to the composition of, manufacturing of, and formulations of Zohydro ER®. We license our U.S. patents and patent applications to our commercial partner Pernix in the United States. We also own Canadian patents and patent applications 
 14


relating to the same technology. The patent protection for Zohydro ER® formulation provides for protection of Zohydro ER® through 2019, subject to any extensions or disclaimers.  In addition, we own several issued patents in the United States and several foreign patent applications for abuse resistant pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use related to Zohydro ER®, which provide patent protection through 2034, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. Although certain patents may have expired or may expire in the future, we believe there are other barriers to entry for our commercial partners and competition, including ownership of regulatory filings, NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications or ANDAs, and drug master files or DMF’s, manufacturing trade secrets, proprietary dosage strengths, pricing limitations in various geographies, costs to revalidate with another supplier, maturity and life-cycle stage of products.
 Intellectual Property Protection Strategy
 We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our product candidates. Our patent strategy is designed to facilitate commercialization of our current product candidates and future product candidates, as well as create barriers to entry for third parties. One focus of our claim strategy is on formulation claims and other related claims.
 We are seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also intend to rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
  
• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defend our patents;
--+--------------------


• | develop trade secrets as needed and preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have taken steps to build and will continue to build proprietary positions for our product candidates and related technology in the United States and abroad. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in the United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by United States patents.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our current intent is to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the United States while out-licensing development and commercialization rights for other territories outside the United States, for which we own the territorial rights. We believe the initial target audience for our product candidates will be specialty physicians, including surgeons, anesthesiologists and pain specialists. Our management team has experience building and launching therapeutics to specialty physicians, including hospital and related settings. As this target audience is only a portion of all physicians, we believe we have the capabilities to build a sales and marketing infrastructure and effectively market our product candidates after FDA approval. We are establishing sales infrastructure, marketing and reimbursement functions to commercialize IV meloxicam, if approved, in the United States. While we plan to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the United States, we will consider potential strategic collaborations that could accelerate or enhance development and, upon approval, commercial success of our product candidates.
Manufacturing and Supply of our Acute Care Product Candidates
 We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug product for our clinical studies under cGMPs, with oversight by our internal managers. We plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture development quantities of our product candidates, as well as commercial quantities of our product candidates, if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for the clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates. We have identified other potential drug product manufacturers that could satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, but this would require significant expense and could produce a significant delay in setting up the facility and moving equipment. Additionally, should a supplier or a manufacturer on whom we rely to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or a product that is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and additional costs.
 15


Injectable Meloxicam
 Alkermes is currently our exclusive supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam. Pursuant to a Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement, Alkermes (through a subsidiary), provides clinical and commercial bulk supplies of injectable meloxicam formulation. During the term of the Supply Agreement, we will purchase our clinical and commercial supplies of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation exclusively from Alkermes. If the first commercial sale of injectable meloxicam occurs on or prior to December 31, 2020, the Supply Agreement will have an initial term expiring ten years following the date of such first commercial sale. The Supply Agreement will then automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. If the first commercial sale of injectable meloxicam has not occurred by December 31, 2020, the Supply Agreement will expire on that date. 
 Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, provides sterile fill-finish of injectable meloxicam drug product pursuant to a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement and Product Agreement, collectively the Patheon Agreements, at its Monza, Italy manufacturing site.  We have agreed to purchase a certain percentage of our annual requirements of finished injectable meloxicam from Patheon during the term of the Patheon Agreements.  The Patheon Agreements expire on December 31, 2020 and will automatically renew thereafter for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice. 
 
NMBAs
 We have successfully sourced the manufacturing of the NMBAs and reversing agent at a contract manufacturer for use in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials for these product candidates.
 Dex-IN
 We are party to an API supply agreement with Orion, whereby Orion provides us with API for the development and, if approved, commercialization of Dex-IN. Prior to obtaining regulatory approval, subject to advance notice to Orion, Orion will provide API without charge for agreed upon amounts. Any amounts ordered by us that are greater than the planned supply will be charged at 50% of the supply price for commercial product. The single unit dose intranasal sprayer for Dex-IN is manufactured by a supplier of proprietary components and devices. Suppliers of components, subassemblies and other materials are located in Europe, Asia and the United States.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our current and future competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able to obtain and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than our product candidates or any other products that we may develop which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidates in our target commercial markets.
 In the post-operative pain relief setting, we believe patients are prescribed injectable acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sodium channel blockers and opioids, depending on the severity of pain. Specifically, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and sodium channel blockers, we believe, are prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief, whereas we believe opioids are prescribed for moderate to severe pain relief. While we will compete with all of these compounds in the post-operative pain setting, we believe injectable meloxicam will be used to manage moderate to severe pain, competing with opioids and predominantly systemic non-opioid pain treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market and or manufacture therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma, L.P., Mallinckrodt plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker, that is injected or instilled at the surgical site. Additionally, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., Durect Corporation, Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Innocoll Holdings plc, Sandoz AG, Trevena, Inc., Avenue Therapeutics, Inc., Neumentum Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with IV meloxicam in the future.

The CDMO segment competes with contract pharmaceutical formulation and manufacturing companies such as Alcami Corporation, Cambrex Corporation, Mylan N.V., Catalent, Inc., Patheon, a part of Thermo Fischer Scientific, Mikart, LLC, Quotient Sciences, and other formulation, development and manufacture-related service providers.
 Information about Segment Revenue
 Information about segment revenue is set forth in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
 Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates, including our formulations of injectable meloxicam, must be approved by the FDA before they may legally be marketed in the United States. In addition, to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or market any products in other countries or develop these products for future licensing to third parties, we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and to the authority of the competent regulatory authorities of those other countries.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative enforcement or judicial sanctions. This enforcement could include, without limitation, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, corrective actions, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, some of which must be conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities identified in the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns regarding the product candidate or non-compliance with applicable requirements.
 17


All clinical trials of a product candidate must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, in accordance with cGCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. The IRB’s role is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in clinical studies by evaluating, among other things, the potential risks and benefits to subjects, processes for obtaining informed consent, monitoring of data to ensure subject safety, and provisions to protect the subjects’ privacy. The IRB approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol, and any amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the IND for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase I. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. Phase II trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Results from earlier trials are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product.
 The submission of an NDA generally is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee for a human drug application. A waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, an applicant is eligible for waiver of the application fee if the applicant is a small business submitting its first human drug application and does not have another product approved under a human drug application and introduced and delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. However, we did not qualify due to prior NDA approvals received by our CDMO segment.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new indication, dosage form, dosing regimen, route of administration, or active ingredient, must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may waive or defer pediatric studies under certain circumstances.
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. As an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and it permits approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and 
 18


permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness of an approved drug product. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA requires submission of information needed to support any changes relative to a previously approved drug, known as the reference product, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant, including bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, or clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the applicant, unless such indications or uses are protected by patent or exclusivity provisions covering the reference product. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its application with respect to any patents for the reference product that are listed in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product, has expired.
 If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the reference product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, or until the patent expires or a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period, and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30-month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable.
 Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
 FDA Review of New Drug Applications. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. If the FDA does not find an NDA to be sufficiently complete for filing, it may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. In this event, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether clinical data demonstrates that a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing process can assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 19


The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and the agency also may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to assure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the FDA may require Phase IV testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specific circumstances of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Subject to certain limitations, the patent term restoration period is generally equal to one-half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. However, each phase of the regulatory review period may be reduced by any time that the FDA finds the applicant did act not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within sixty days of approval of the drug. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for patents that issue from some of our currently owned or licensed patents or patent applications to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to NDAs for products containing chemical entities never previously approved by the FDA alone or in combination. A new chemical entity means a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any application submitted under Section 505(b) of the FDCA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. This exclusivity provision does not prevent the submission or approval of another full Section 505(b)(1) NDA, but such an NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support new indications, dosages, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use. This exclusivity, which is sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an application under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such three-year exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected aspects of the approved drug product.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity to any existing exclusivity (e.g., three- or five-year exclusivity) or patent protection for a drug. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity or patent protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other government agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the false or misleading promotion of drugs. The FDA also limits the promotion of product candidates prior to their approval. With limited exceptions, pre-approval promotion is prohibited under the FDA’s regulations.
 Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process may require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to list their products and to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates for the Acute Care segment. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our CDMO sites or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled and warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, became law. The Cures Act contains numerous provisions, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies and encourage greater use of real-world evidence to support regulatory decision making for drugs.
 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and other Governmental Actions
 Certain products that we manufacture are regulated as a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered and enforced by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances by controlling them in five schedules. Schedule I and II controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, whereas Schedule III-V controlled substances have relatively decreasing potential for abuse. Therefore, the DEA imposes more stringent controls on Schedule I and II substances than Schedule III-V substances, including stricter security controls, quotas, and increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Certain of the products we manufacture and/or develop are regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances that we manufacture may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. In April 2018, the DEA proposed new guidelines aimed at strengthening the process for setting controls over diversion of controlled substances and making other improvements in the quota managements regulatory system for the production, manufacturing and procurement of controlled substances. Following a public comment period, the DEA published the final guidelines, which were substantially similar to the proposed guidelines, in July 2018.  For 2019, the DEA has proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including hydrocodone 
 21


which we use in the manufacture of certain products in our CDMO division, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.
 The DEA requires facilities that manufacture controlled substances to adhere to certain security requirements. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution, acquisition, and inventory reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and suspicious orders. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 The DEA requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring, or SOM, system includes well-defined due diligence, “know your customer” efforts and order monitoring.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances.  Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances.  We are subject to state regulation of distribution for these products. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly where noncompliance results in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations, or take other enforcement action. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal prosecution.
 In addition to DEA regulations, the U.S. government and state legislatures have enacted legislation and regulations intended to fight the opioid epidemic.  In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid epidemic, which is part of a broader initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the release of a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, FDA’s requirement of enhanced warnings and safety labeling, and institution of a class-wide REMs as a condition of approval.  Further, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, was passed in 2016.  CARA provides resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids.  A Senate bill introduced in February 2018, known as CARA 2.0, would further limit initial prescriptions for opioids to three days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 would also increase civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids.  More recently, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or Support Act, has been enacted.  It provides for further regulation as well as funding for research and development of non-addictive painkillers.  State legislatures have followed in the footsteps of the federal government in passing similar laws intended to limit prescription sales and quantities as well as increase the ability to monitor and regulate the manufacture and sale of opioids.  These efforts may result in a reduction of demand for opioid products manufactured by our CDMO segment or government action against us if we fail to comply, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
 For example, in the European Union, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the European Commission on the basis of a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between European Union member states. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authority of all European Union member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other European Union member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public 
 22


health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of European Union member states by the competent authorities of other European Union member states. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of a European Union member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another European Union member state for the same medicinal product.
 We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, and other third country anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships with foreign government officials. The U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to any company incorporated or doing business in the UK, prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official or private person, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery amongst employees and other agents. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. Liability in relation to breaches of the U.K. Bribery Act is strict. This means that it is not necessary to demonstrate elements of a corrupt state of mind. However, a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
 Formulary Approvals and Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our Acute Care segment product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of institutional formulary approvals and on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States.  These payers include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal program that runs the Medicare program and monitors the Medicaid programs offered by each state, as well as national and regional commercial plans. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by CMS through local Medicare Administrative Contractors that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly, disabled and other individuals with certain conditions. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each government or commercial plan has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product and how much it will pay for that procedure or product. Commercial plans often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable Medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually an essential component of successfully launching a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by government and other commercial plans.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government healthcare programs and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices.
 Payers also are increasingly changing the metrics for reimbursement rates, such as basing payment on average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and wholesale acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover any products for which we receive regulatory approval.
 If we successfully commercialize any of our products, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we would be required to pay a quarterly rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.
 23


Additionally, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its innovator and single source products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price. Moreover, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD’s TRICARE Management Activity, now the Defense Health Agency, to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to provide rebates on utilization of their innovator and single source products that are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and is based on the difference between the annual non-federal average manufacturer price and the Federal Ceiling Price (these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA). The requirements under the 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future.
 There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers costs, including research, development, manufacturing, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Product reimbursement may also be incorporated into existing bundled payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or commercial payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. Third-party payers also may seek additional clinical evidence, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. If reimbursement is available only for limited indications, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and commercial payers for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. Moreover, the requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union the sole legal instrument at the European Union level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of the Price Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in European Union member states are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the European Union and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual European Union member states. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual European Union member states. The national authorities of the individual European Union member states are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Some individual European Union member states adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other European Union member states adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territory either, on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries, or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Furthermore, some European Union member states impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some European Union member states. These countries include the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden. The HTA process in the European Union member states is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
 The outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual European Union member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the European Union member states.
 24


In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at European Union level. This Directive concerns the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the European Union. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual European Union member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between European Union member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA in pricing and reimbursement decisions and negatively impact price in at least some European Union member states.
 United States Healthcare Reform
 The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
 In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. There have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act.  For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry generally.
 The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.0 billion in 2017, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.”
 The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase.
 25


In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. Continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve a profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our activities may become subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil False Claims Act, and laws and regulations pertaining to limitations on and reporting of healthcare provider payments (physician sunshine laws). These laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced by various federal, state and local authorities including CMS, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These laws include:

• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through “qui tam,” or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, may subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions including penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and/or adverse publicity.
 26


Moreover, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including state investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the marketing of opioid products.
 In addition to regulations in the United States, to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign healthcare laws and compliance requirements. For example, in the European Union, the EU Data Protection Directive imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions. Data protection authorities from the different European Union member states may interpret the applicable laws differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union.
 Although there are legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the U.S., the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Schrems case (Case C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) invalidated the Safe Harbor framework and increased uncertainty around compliance with European Union restrictions on cross-border data transfers. As a result of the decision, it was no longer possible to rely on Safe Harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to entities in the U.S. On February 29, 2016, however, the European Commission announced an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce, or DoC, to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new EU-U.S. “Privacy Shield.” On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is intended to address the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its ruling by imposing more stringent obligations on companies, providing stronger monitoring and enforcement by the DoC and Federal Trade Commission, and making commitments on the part of public authorities regarding access to information. U.S. companies have been able to certify to the DoC their compliance with the privacy principles of the Privacy Shield since August 1, 2016.
 On September 16, 2016, the Irish privacy advocacy group Digit
al Rights Ireland brought an action for annulment of the European Commission decision on the adequacy of the Privacy Shield before the European Court of Justice (Case T-670/16). In October 2016, a further action for annulment was brought by three French digital rights advocacy groups (Case T-738/16). 
Case T-670/16 and Case T-738/16 are 
still pending before the European Court of Justice. If, however, the European Court of Justice invalidates the Privacy Shield, it will no longer be possible to rely on the Privacy Shield certification to support transfer of personal data from the European Union to entities in the US. Adherence to the Privacy Shield is not, however, mandatory. U.S.-based companies are permitted to rely either on their adherence to the EU-US Privacy Shield or on the other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the EU Data Protection Directive.
 In December 2015, a proposal for an EU General Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, introducing new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation has applied since May 25, 2018. The EU Data Protection Regulation increased the responsibility and liability in relation to personal data processed in the European Union and also introduced substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. Furthermore, there is a growth towards the public disclosure of clinical trial data in the European Union which adds to the complexity of processing health data from clinical trials. During 2018, we implemented policies and controls to adhere to the EU General Data Protection Regulation.
