Change in Fiscal Year-End
 
On January 29, 2021, the Board of Directors of Flowerkist Skin Care and Cosmetics, Inc., (the “Company”) approved the change in the Company’s fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the globe. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Most U.S. states and many countries have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease such as issuing temporary Executive Orders that, among other stipulations, effectively prohibit in-person work activities for most industries and businesses, having the effect of suspending or severely curtailing operations. COVID-19 and the U. S’s response to the pandemic are significantly affecting the economy. There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. Accordingly, while management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company, the related consequences and duration are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
History and Overview
 
We were formerly a Nevada corporation based out of Orlando, Florida. We intended to participate in cutting edge development and import and sell state of the art 3D printers, scanners, and ancillary equipment. Our mission was to provide individual and corporate customers with the most advanced and reliable cutting edge 3D printing technology in the most cost effective packages available in the marketplace at whatever level is appropriate for their needs. We want our business to be the “go to” vendor of 3D printers for individuals and businesses. Our focus was on the development of powderless metal and medical printers and printing technology.

The 3D printing industry is in its very early stages but is already getting more press and generating more excitement than almost any other technological development of recent years. It is not often that a new idea is constantly described as moving the goalposts for the way we actually live our lives. Amidst all the press and the hype, the reality of what the technology is capable of and the speed of its improvement is breathtaking.
 
We were committed to supplying the best plastic, medical, culinary, and powderless metal 3D printers in the industry, and we are supplied by one of the largest and most experienced 3D printing research, development, and manufacturing entities in the world. 3D MakerJet’s research and development partner and manufacturer, ZBOT / Guangzhou DNSPOWER Design Co. LTD, was founded in 2000, and is a leader in the 3D printing industry. A cutting-edge developer in the manufacturing sector, ZBOT won the coveted CDA National Design Award for its ZBOT 3D Printer, which is the platform of the 3D MakerJet printer line, making their 3D printer the only CDA winner at the Civilian level, reflecting the product’s superior quality, as well as the manufacturer’s comprehensive strength, commitment, and capabilities.
