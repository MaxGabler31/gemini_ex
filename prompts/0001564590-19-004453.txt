Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Benefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, suppliers and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals transact benefits. Our employer, carrier and supplier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange benefits data seamlessly. Our solutions drive value for all participants in our benefits ecosystem.
 The Benefitfocus multi-tenant platform has a user-friendly interface designed for consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support medical benefit plans and non-medical benefits, such as, dental, life, disability insurance, income protection, digital health and financial wellness. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform is growing.
 Brokers use our platform to manage employer portfolios. This includes delivering strategic insights that improve their employer clients’ benefit experience and demonstrating greater value through access to a larger set of relevant products for employers, which should bring higher broker commissions and profits. 
 Employers use our solutions to streamline benefits processes and control costs, keep up with challenging and ever-changing regulatory requirements, and offer a greater variety of benefit options to attract, retain and motivate employees. The Benefitfocus Platform enables our employer customers to simplify the management of complex benefits processes, from sales and enrollment to implementation and ongoing administration. It provides their employees with an engaging, highly intuitive and personalized user interface for selecting and managing all of their benefits via a desktop or mobile device.

Insurance carriers and suppliers use our solutions to more effectively market offerings to consumers, simplify billing, and improve the enrollment process. We also provide a network of approximately 2,200 benefit provider data exchange connections, which facilitates the otherwise highly fragmented interaction among employees, employers, brokers and carriers.
 Since our initial public offering, we have described our target market as comprising two separate but related market segments – the employer segment and the insurance carrier segment. Within the employer segment, we sell our technology solutions on an annually recurring or multi-year subscription basis to large employers, which we define as those with more than 1,000 employees. Similarly, in our other market segment, we sell our solutions on a subscription basis to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier segments gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem. As of December 31, 2018, we served 1,024 large employer customers, an increase from 141 in 2010, and 57 carrier customers, an increase from 29 in 2010.
 In 2018, we expanded our economic model to include a transaction-oriented, marketplace solution, known as BenefitsPlace, that aligns employers, brokers, carriers and suppliers around the needs of consumers on our platform from our employer, carrier and broker connections.  In this model, our BenefitsPlace partners sell their voluntary benefit offerings through a holistic, multidimensional marketplace.  This marketplace is designed to increase the economic value of the consumer lives on our platform by aligning platform products to consumer needs. In exchange for Benefitfocus delivering consumer access, data-driven analysis and operational efficiencies, BenefitsPlace partners pay us a percentage of the transaction value that is transacted on our platform. BenefitsPlace carrier agreements have terms of two to four years and are typically cancellable upon breach of contract or insolvency.  BenefitsPlace supplier contracts have terms of one year or less and are generally cancellable upon breach of contract, failure to cure, bankruptcy and termination for convenience. 
 Our hybrid software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and repeatable transaction-based model provides us significant visibility into our future operating results, which enhances our ability to manage our business. Our company was founded in 2000, and we currently employ approximately 1,450 associates, or employees.
 Industry Background
 The administration and distribution of benefits to employees is a mainstay of the U.S. economy. Providing these benefits is costly and complex and requires the exchange of information, application of rules, and transfer of funds among a wide variety of constituents, including consumers, employers, insurance carriers, suppliers, brokers, benefits outsourcers, payroll processors, and financial institutions. The size of the HR benefits administration market and the value of benefits transacted are large. According to IBISWorld calculations, in 2017, the market for HR benefits administration in the United States is expected to grow to over $54 billion. Eastbridge Consulting Group estimates the U.S. in-force premiums were $42 billion in 2017 for employee-paid life, health and disability products sold at the worksite with premiums paid through payroll.
 The variety and complexity of medical and non-medical benefits plans continues to grow. The Benefitfocus 2017 annual market research report, The State of Employee Benefits 2018, indicates that a higher proportion of benefits offerings are shifting to high-deductible health plans coupled with health savings accounts. This added complexity places greater potential cost burden on employees and creates a greater need for employers to educate employees on becoming more informed healthcare consumers. To help employees cover added cost burdens, employers are increasingly offering a wider range of non-medical benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income, and financial wellness programs, as well as traditional insurance offerings like dental, life and disability. Current point and legacy systems are inadequate to efficiently manage the complexity, regulation, and the involvement of multiple parties. They are also incapable or inadequate in enabling the purchase of non-medical benefits. These factors are driving the need for an enterprise benefits management system to improve operational efficiency along the entire benefits value chain.

Employer Market
 Currently, we believe there are over 18,000 entities that employ more than 1,000 individuals in the United States. A significant and growing portion of employers’ costs is non-salary benefits, such as health insurance, that they provide to their employees. With healthcare and other premiums increasing, senior executives are prioritizing benefits administration in their organizations and searching for ways to contain costs without sacrificing benefits. In addition, the expense burden continues to shift to employees. Employees’ contributions to premiums for health insurance have grown from approximately $318 per employee in 1999 to approximately $1,186 per employee in 2018. Employers recognize the importance of offering a greater variety of non-medical benefits as a means to attract, motivate, and retain employees. They must maintain relationships with multiple insurance carriers and many other benefits providers, placing a substantial administrative burden on their organizations.
 Employers’ distribution, management, and administration of employee benefits has historically consisted of error-prone, paper-based processes, and a patchwork of customized software tools, which are costly to maintain, often lack necessary functionality, and fail to address the increasing complexity of the benefits marketplace. As benefits offerings become more complex and employees bear more of the cost of those benefits, HR software solutions that streamline information, simplify choices, and engage employees are increasingly in demand. Employees desire tailored, dynamic, and interactive communication of critical benefits information as they become accustomed to receiving personalized content through various consumer applications on a range of devices.
 Legacy HR systems were generally designed as extensions of enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems, built for back-office responsibilities like finance and accounting. As a result, these systems lack functionality and ease-of-use for employees. Many legacy HR systems were not designed to integrate with the broader benefits ecosystem, including brokers, carriers, and wellness providers, or have the ability to transact non-medical benefits. This results in expensive, error-prone, and incomplete experiences for employers and employees. Benefits outsourcers have attempted to compensate for the shortcomings of legacy HR systems, but they have generally lacked adequate technology solutions necessary to keep up with the rapidly evolving benefits landscape. As a result, employees are often not provided with the appropriate functionality and information required to select and manage their benefits effectively.
 Modern technology, changing communication patterns, and a constantly evolving benefits ecosystem have impacted the employee-employer relationship. HR executives continue to search for effective strategies to increase efficiency and contain costs, while increasing employee engagement and being an employer of choice. Employers are increasingly interested in SaaS solutions that can help capture and analyze benefits data and provide more choice for their employees to improve productivity and satisfaction. In order to manage the distribution and administration of benefits effectively, employers need an integrated platform, capable of handling all benefits in one place and providing a highly personalized experience for employees.
 Insurance Carrier Market
 The employee benefits market consists of a myriad of medical insurance carriers and products. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the single largest benefit provided to employees in the United States is healthcare insurance, often encompassing more than 90% of all insurance benefits spending by employers. 
 Large, national insurance carriers also offer numerous individual health plans of different types, including health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, point-of-service plans, and high deductible health plans, across the 50 states, as well as life and ancillary benefits plans. Each carrier offers a complex variety of medical insurance and non-medical benefits, encompassing life and ancillary plans, with each plan requiring multiple decisions to address the specific needs of employers and their individual employees. Despite widespread carrier consolidation, numerous disparate systems remain in place, with many large carriers operating on multiple IT systems. Carriers often rely on manual processes and siloed software applications to bridge gaps in legacy administration systems. Even as carriers attempt to modernize and keep up with evolving industry practices and a changing regulatory landscape, they have difficulty connecting with the broader healthcare system.

The effective delivery and management of employee benefits depends on the timely, continuous exchange of accurate data among carriers, their employer customers, and individual members. Legacy benefits management systems often lack important functionality such as web and mobile self-service capabilities and real-time data exchange. Critical carrier processes, including member enrollment, billing, communications, and retail marketing have often been under-optimized or neglected by legacy systems, and carriers have devoted significant internal resources to cover technology gaps. In addition, healthcare reform mandates and the rise of exchanges have increased focus on carriers’ retail distribution capabilities, which require additional investment.
 Governmental oversight, punctuated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, has led to an increasingly dynamic regulatory framework under which health benefits are delivered, accessed and maintained. Despite uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of PPACA, we expect digital transformation of healthcare benefits to continue in the form of public and private exchanges – online marketplaces that allow insurance carriers to compete directly for new members. We expect private exchanges will be less rigid, promoting both health and non-health benefits, with substantially fewer rules around the types of benefits offered. As medical insurance carriers continue to bolster their retail distribution capabilities, we believe they will require consolidation of technology solutions to improve operational efficiency and attract additional members through private exchanges.
 The Benefitfocus Solutions 
 We provide a multi-tenant cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, suppliers and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals transact benefits. 
 We believe our solutions help employers and clients of brokers in the following important ways:
 Simplify Benefits Enrollment.    Our solutions reduce the complexity of benefits enrollment by integrating all plan information in one place and presenting it to employees in an organized and easy-to-understand manner. Employees shop and enroll using a highly intuitive and engaging consumer-oriented interface. 
 Purchase non-medical benefits.    Our platform includes a holistic, multidimensional marketplace whereby carriers and suppliers sell non-medical products to consumers.  
Reduce Cost and Increase ROI.    Our solutions automate the benefits management process and reduce the cost associated with clerical errors and covering ineligible employees and dependents. Our solutions also include advanced analytics that enable employers and employees to quickly gather, report, and forecast benefit costs.
 Attract, Retain, and Motivate Employees.    Our solutions help employers attract, retain, and motivate top talent by delivering benefits information through a highly intuitive and engaging user interface. We believe that when employees understand the value of their benefits, they are more likely to be satisfied with and engaged in their jobs.
 Streamline HR Processes.    Our solutions eliminate the time-consuming and labor-intensive, often paper-based, processes associated with managing employee benefits plans, making HR professionals more efficient. Employers and HR professionals can efficiently enroll users or update information, and communicate or make changes to plans in real-time. 
 Integrate Seamlessly with Related Systems.    Our solutions can be easily and securely integrated with a variety of related systems, including carrier membership and billing, payroll and HR, banking, and other third-party administration. We provide a network of approximately 2,200 benefit provider data exchange connections through industry standards interfaces that are configurable to accommodate a variety of needs. Our open architecture further extends our functionality by allowing third parties to develop and offer apps and services on our platform.

We believe our solutions help insurance carriers and suppliers in the following important ways:
 Bolster Retail Distribution Capabilities Through Marketplaces.    Our solutions help carriers and suppliers respond to an evolving marketplace in which retail distribution capabilities are increasingly important to attracting and retaining new members. Our platform offers carriers a lower cost direct sales channel to employer groups and individuals. We offer the ability to sell both healthcare and non-healthcare benefit products in an online shopping environment that serves as an alternative to government-sponsored public exchanges.
 Attract and Maintain Membership.    Our solutions allow carriers to maximize sales capacity and efficiency by communicating directly with their employer customers and individual members. 
 Reduce Administrative Costs.    The Benefitfocus Platform allows carriers to consolidate IT systems, automate and simplify various aspects of the benefits administration process, such as enrollment, plan changes, eligibility updates, and billing, from one centralized location. 
 Facilitate Real-Time Data Exchange.    Our solutions simplify interactions and data exchange, and foster collaboration among carriers, suppliers, brokers employers and consumers. This allows carriers to rapidly tailor and offer new benefits packages.
Our Growth Strategy 
 We believe BenefitsPlace can transform how employers, brokers and carriers deliver value for employees and their families. With more than 40 industry-leading products offered by the industry’s marquee brands, employers can now seamlessly package a rich benefits offering that addresses health, wealth and lifestyle needs. 
 We intend to strengthen our position as a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for buyers and sellers, working closely with brokers as partner in the ecosystem. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following:
 Expand our Customer Base.    We believe that our current customer base represents a small fraction of our targeted users that could benefit from our subscription solutions. In order to reach new customers in our existing markets, we are aggressively investing in our sales and marketing resources and our channel marketing strategy, including in ways intended to expand existing relationships and foster organic growth opportunities through brokers.
 Further Develop our Partner Ecosystem.    We believe we have a large opportunity to efficiently grow our customer base through our partners. To increase the number of consumers on our platform, we have established strong relationships with key participants in the benefits market, including Mercer Health & Benefits, LLC (“Mercer”), SAP and SuccessFactors. We have also eliminated previous friction and improved our outreach to key constituents within the benefits industry, like brokers. One such example is the introduction of our Premier Broker program in 2018. 
 Deepen our Relationships with our Existing Customer Base.    We are deepening our employer relationships by continuing to provide a unified platform with a growing list of additional solutions to manage increasingly complex benefits processes and simplify the distribution and administration of employee benefits. We are expanding our carrier relationships through both the upsell of additional software products, increased adoption across our carriers’ member populations and providing access to our multidimensional marketplace. 
 Extend our Suite of Applications and Continue our Technology Leadership.    We are extending the number, range, and functionality of our benefits solutions. We have also extended the functionality of our products through mobile solutions. We intend to continue our collaboration with customers and partners, so we can respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative capabilities that support our leadership position.
 Facilitate the purchase of non-medical benefits.    We believe that our current BenefitsPlace portfolio of products represents a fraction of the number and variety of products that we expect will be offered on 
 6

our multidimensional marketplace.  We also believe we have a significant opportunity to drive higher employer placement of BenefitsPlace products and increase consumer engagement in purchasing BenefitsPlace products throughout an entire calendar year. 
 Target New Markets.    We believe substantial demand for our solutions exists in markets and geographies beyond our current focus. We intend to leverage opportunities we believe will arise from the complexities of changing government regulation and increased enrollment impacting both Medicare and Medicaid. We also plan to grow our sales capability internationally by expanding our direct sales force and collaborating with strategic partners in new, international locations.
 Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Investments.    We might pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses and technologies that align with our overall growth strategy. We believe that a selective acquisition and investment strategy could enable us to gain new customers, accelerate our expansion into new markets, and enhance our product capabilities.

Technology Infrastructure and Operations
As an enterprise cloud software vendor, we have always deployed our solutions using a SaaS model. Our customers access our software via application integrations, web browsers, and/or mobile devices, rather than by installing software on their premises. Through our multi-tenant architecture, our customers access a single software instance with multiple possible configurations enabled by our metadata-driven framework. The multi-tenant approach provides significant operating economies through aligned, shared computational services and processes as it helps us to reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. In addition, our software architecture gives us an advantage over legacy system vendors, who may be using a less flexible architecture that would require significant time and labor expense to address varied capability needs.
 We host our applications and serve all of our customers from two redundant, co-located, private cloud data centers in separate locations. We rely on third-party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host mission-critical computer systems and have industry-standard measures in place to minimize service interruptions. Our technical operations staff manages the technology stacks supporting the Benefitfocus Platform and uses automated monitoring tools throughout our system to detect unusual events or malfunctions that could interfere with our customers’ or partners’ use of the Benefitfocus Platform. We monitor application health by verifying that all applications, interfaces and supporting middleware are operational. If our monitoring detects anomalous situations, our dedicated network operations staff respond immediately to diagnose the situation, communicate status, and resolve the matter. We take the security of our data, systems and operations very seriously, and minimize risk at every level of technology selection through software architecture, systems administration, and operational controls and procedures.
 Compliance and Certifications 
 We obtain third-party examinations of our controls relating to security and data privacy. Certain examinations are conducted under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, or SSAE, No. 16 (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization). In particular, we obtain Service Organization Controls, or SOC, reports known as SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II audits that test the design and operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time. An independent auditor conducts these examinations annually and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and procedures covering integrity, change management, and logical security. 
 On an annual basis, we complete an internal audit of compliance against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or PCI-DSS, applicable to Level 1 service providers. These standards focus on application and network security controls for companies that transmit and store credit card data on behalf of clients. Benefitfocus meets PCI compliance requirements as a Level 1 service provider and submits its Report on Compliance and Attestation of Compliance documenting this assessment to the four major credit card brands annually.
 In addition to PCI-DDS, Benefitfocus meets all applicable security requirements required by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, or NACHA, for third-party service providers, as well as all requirements for Covered Entities as required by HIPAA. We validate both NACHA and HIPAA compliance annually through internal audits.

 While we do not believe any single competitor offers similarly expansive benefits administration solutions, we face competition from various sources, many of which have greater resources than us. We have historically described our competition in our two market segments, carrier and employer. In 2018, we made a strategic shift to include a transaction-based model with the introduction of BenefitsPlace. We believe that sources of competition are similar to those that we faced prior to the shift, which include:

• | ERP software companies, including Oracle (PeopleSoft), Infor (Lawson) and Workday each offering a cloud-based benefits administration software solution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HR outsourcing companies, such as Willis Towers Watson;
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | payroll service providers, such as ADP who expanded their core payroll services to include some form of cloud-based benefits administration services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | insurance carriers that have invested in internally developed benefit management solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | member services companies, including those providing web-based subscriber enrollment and claims adjudication services, such as Trizetto (acquired by Cognizant) and DST Health Solutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brokers and consultants who have influence over benefits offerings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | various niche software vendors.
--+--------------------------------

 We believe that competition for benefits administration solutions is based primarily on the following factors:
  
• | capability for customization through configuration, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competitive and understandable pricing;
--+----------------------------------------


• | breadth and depth of application functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | access to broad offering of non-medical benefits;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | extensive data exchange network;
--+---------------------------------


• | cloud-based delivery model;
--+----------------------------


• | dynamic communication capabilities with contextual media, animation, and acknowledgement tools;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise in benefits and healthcare consumerism;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | extensive base of rules and event-driven benefit eligibility and enrollment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accessible on any browser or mobile device;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | modern and adaptive technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | clearly defined implementation timeline;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | customer-branding and styling;
--+-------------------------------


• | data exchange standardization; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer and legislative needs rapidly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete effectively based upon all of these criteria, and that we are likely to continue to retain a high percentage of our customers from year to year. Nonetheless, we believe that the increasing acceptance of automated solutions in the healthcare marketplace and the adoption of more sophisticated technology and continuing legislative reform will result in increased competition, including potentially from large software companies with greater resources than ours. Other companies might develop superior or more economical service offerings that our customers could find more attractive than our offerings. Moreover, the regulatory landscape might shift in a direction that is more strategically advantageous to competitors.
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. We deliver multiple software releases per year, updating the Benefitfocus Platform to leverage advances in cloud computing, mobile applications, and data management. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, data storage systems, and other tools. We use both commercial and 
 12

open source products, following a “best tool for the job” philosophy in product selection. Our software has a multi-tiered architecture that ensures flexibility to add or modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs, or regulatory requirements.
 Our research and development expenses were $47.9 million, $49.5 million and $56.6 million for the years December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in our business. We generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our associates, consultants, vendors, and customers. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.
 We use numerous trademarks for our products and services, and “Benefitfocus”, “HR InTouch”, “HR InTouch Marketplace”, “All Your Benefits. One Place.”, and “All Your Benefits. In Your Pocket.” are registered marks of Benefitfocus in the United States. Through claimed common law trademark protection, we also protect other Benefitfocus marks which identify our services, such as Benefitfocus eEnrollment, Benefitfocus eBilling, Benefitfocus eExchange, and Benefitfocus eSales, and we have reserved numerous domain names, including “benefitfocus.com”. We also have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, India, Israel, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.
 We have been granted eight U.S. patents (utility patents) and have two U.S. patent applications (all for utility patents) pending. Our patents provide protections up to 2034. We also have three Chinese, two Japanese, Australian, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong, and one Canadian patents and a number of pending patent applications. 
 We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties. Although we believe that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licenses, these third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.
 Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 The steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and the potential exists that third parties could infringe, misappropriate, or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and adversely affect our competitive position or operations. In addition, laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company expands outside of the United States.
 Government Regulation 
 Introduction
 The employee benefits industry is required to comply with extensive and complex U.S. laws and regulations at the federal and state levels. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws, and 
 13

we may be impacted by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. For many of these laws, there is little history of regulatory or judicial interpretation upon which to rely.
 Requirements of PPACA
 Our business could be affected by changes in healthcare spending. PPACA and subsequent laws and regulations regarding the market for healthcare services have changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. PPACA, as enacted, expanded coverage of uninsured individuals by requiring states to expand Medicaid coverage significantly and to establish health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance policies by individuals and small employers. The law also provided subsidies to states to create non-Medicaid plans for certain low-income residents. The requirement for states to expand Medicaid was subsequently repealed, and insurers have experienced mixed results providing services through the exchanges, leading many to exit this market. Increased volatility following the repeal of the individual mandate in late 2017 has led to additional uncertainty in the insurance market. 
 A significant goal of PPACA and subsequent reform efforts has been to move away from fee for service payments and toward capitated payments to make providers more accountable for the cost and quality of care provided.  While many of the provisions of PPACA will not be directly applicable to us, PPACA, as currently implemented, might affect the business of many of our customers. Carriers and large employers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of Medicaid expansion and the creation of state and national exchanges, though it is unclear how many states will decline to implement the Medicaid expansion or adopt state-specific exchanges. 
 Following the creation of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, Medicare and many commercial third party payors began implementing accountable care models in which groups of providers known as Accountable Care Organizations ("ACO") assume some amount of risk for the cost of care provided to groups of individuals. Also, CMS continues to test demonstration programs to bundle acute care and post–acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans, and will likely impact the business of our customers. 
 As has been the case since 2010, the long-term viability of PPACA remains in doubt, and we expect that the current Congress and White House will continue to seek ways to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of PPACA.  For instance, on January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order stating that the U.S. federal government’s policy is to seek the prompt repeal of PPACA, and directing the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of PPACA to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Also, the December 2017 revisions to the tax code eliminated PPACA’s individual mandate, which could serve as a basis for continued challenges to the constitutionality of the law and cause further disruption to the insurance markets.  Should Congress or the courts modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate PPACA or any parts of its provisions, the business of our customers could be substantially affected.
 Requirements Regarding the Confidentiality, Privacy and Security of Personal Information
 HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. Numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations apply to the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected health information. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and most healthcare providers are considered "Covered Entities" subject to HIPAA. 
 With respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, we are directly subject to the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. In addition, our carrier customers, or payors, are considered to be Covered Entities and are required to enter into written agreements with us, known as Business Associate Agreements, under which we are considered to be a Business Associate and that require us to safeguard protected health information and restrict how we may use and disclose such information. The Privacy Rule extensively regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information by Covered Entities and their Business Associates. For example, the Privacy Rule permits Covered Entities and their Business Associates to use and disclose protected health information for treatment and to process claims for 
 14

payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule also provides patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the extent permitted by the Privacy Rule and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the Privacy Rule and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The Security Rule requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored.
 If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Further, if we fail to comply with the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, or Breach Notification Rule while acting as a Covered Entity or Business Associate, we could face civil penalties of up to $57,051 per violation and a maximum civil penalty of $1,711,533 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, in addition to criminal penalties. Recently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA, appears to have increased its enforcement activities. Additionally, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. 
 There are additional privacy and data security legal regimes at the federal and state level. For example, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regularly brings privacy and data enforcement actions under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, alleging that certain activities constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices. The states have similar laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices. There are also state data security laws and state laws that regulate the use and disclosure of health information, among others. Further, by regulation, the FTC’s Red Flags Rule requires some financial institutions and creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. We may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule. 
 We have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards, including written policies and procedures, intended to protect all personal data, including protected health information, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any data breaches or incidents.
 Data Breach Notification Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that generally require notice to affected individuals, regulators, and sometimes the media or credit reporting agencies in the event of a data breach impacting personal information. For example, at the federal level, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule mandates notification of breaches affecting protected health information to affected individuals and regulators under conditions set forth in the Rule. Covered Entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a Covered Entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business Associates must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to Covered Entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the Business Associate or its agents. All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted data breach notification laws. While some of these breach notification laws contain an exception for entities subject to HIPAA, other laws do not, and may impose notification obligations in addition to, or inconsistent with, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule when a data breach implicates protected health information.   
HIPAA Administrative Simplification
 HIPAA also mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain healthcare claims and payment transactions. These regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry and apply directly to Covered Entities. Some of our businesses, including our healthcare 
 15

clearinghouse operations, are considered Covered Entities under HIPAA and its implementing regulations.
 Transaction Standards.    The standard transaction regulations established under HIPAA, or Transaction Standards, mandate certain format and data content standards for the most common electronic healthcare transactions, using technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations. These transactions include healthcare claims, enrollment, payment and eligibility. The Transaction Standards are applicable to that portion of our business involving the processing of healthcare transactions among payors, providers, patients and other healthcare industry constituents. Failure to comply with the Transaction Standards may subject us to civil and potentially criminal penalties and breach of contract claims. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, is responsible for enforcing the Transaction Standards.
 Payors who are unable to exchange data in the required standard formats can achieve Transaction Standards compliance by contracting with a clearinghouse to translate between standard and non-standard formats. As a result, use of a clearinghouse has allowed numerous payors to establish compliance with the Transaction Standards independently and at different times, reducing transition costs and risks. In addition, the standardization of formats and data standards envisioned by the Transaction Standards has only partially occurred. However, PPACA requires HHS to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. We cannot provide assurance regarding how the CMS will enforce the Transaction Standards. We have modified our systems and processes to implement the Transaction Standards and we continue to work with payors, healthcare information system vendors and other healthcare constituents to maintain our implementation of the Transaction Standards.
 Health Plan and Other Entity Identifiers.    HHS has promulgated regulations implementing the establishment of a unique health plan identifier, or HPID. Similar to a provider’s national provider identifier, the HPID provides an identification system for health plans to use for electronic transactions. HHS has also promulgated regulations implementing another entity identifier, or OEID, that serves as an identifier for entities that are not health plans, health care providers or individuals. These other entities, which include third-party administrators, transaction vendors, and clearinghouses, are not required to obtain an OEID, but they could obtain and use one if they needed to be identified in standardized transactions. The implementation of the enforcement of the HPID and OEID process has been indefinitely delayed by HHS, and if implemented its impact on our business is unclear at this time.
Financial Services Related Laws and Rules
 Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. As a result, we might be impacted by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations and industry standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limits. In addition, our patient billing and payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network, or ACH, are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payor customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payors to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a “clean claim” within a specified time frame.
Banking Regulation 
 The Goldman Sachs Group, affiliates of which owned approximately 11.8% of the voting and economic interest in our business as of December 31, 2018, is regulated as a bank holding company and 
 16

a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act. Due to the size of its voting and economic interest, we are deemed to be controlled by The Goldman Sachs Group and are therefore considered to be a non-bank “subsidiary” of The Goldman Sachs Group under the BHC Act. As a result, although we do not engage in banking operations, we are subject to regulation, supervision, examination and potential enforcement action by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to The Goldman Sachs Group. In addition, certain restrictions applicable to Goldman Sachs under the BHC Act apply to the Company as well, and we may be subject to regulatory oversight and examination because we are a technology service provider to regulated financial institutions. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the safety and soundness of depository institutions, the federal deposit insurance system, and depositors rather than our stockholders. Because of The Goldman Sachs Group’s status as a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we have agreed to certain covenants for the benefit of The Goldman Sachs Group that are intended to facilitate its compliance with the BHC Act. 
 In addition, the Volcker Rule, which was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, in relevant part, restricts banking entities from proprietary trading (subject to certain exemptions) and from acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other interests in, or sponsoring, a private equity fund, subject to satisfying certain conditions, and from engaging in certain transactions with funds. In 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the review of existing financial regulations. In May 2018, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. This legislation provides regulatory relief for certain financial institutions. These and other legislative and regulatory initiatives could change the regulation or operations of the financial services industry. 
 Under the current legislation, we will continue to be deemed to be controlled by The Goldman Sachs Group for purposes of the BHC Act and, therefore, we will continue to be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and to the BHC Act, as well as certain other banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to The Goldman Sachs Group. We will remain subject to this regulatory regime until The Goldman Sachs Group is no longer deemed to control us for bank regulatory purposes, which we do not generally have the ability to control and which will not occur until The Goldman Sachs Group has significantly reduced its voting and economic interest in us. We cannot predict the ownership level at which the Federal Reserve would consider us no longer controlled by The Goldman Sachs Group, but it could be less than 10%.
 The Goldman Sachs Group and its subsidiaries, including Benefitfocus, generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a bank holding company or a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act. The scope of services we may provide to our customers is limited under the BHC Act to those which are (i) financial in nature or incidental to financial activities (including data processing services such as those that we provide with our software solutions) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and which do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. We believe that our current and anticipated business activities are permitted under the BHC Act.
 Any failure of The Goldman Sachs Group to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on our activities and our growth. In particular, our permissible activities could be further restricted to only those that constitute banking or activities closely related to banking. The Goldman Sachs Group’s loss of its financial holding company status could be caused by several factors, including any failure by The Goldman Sachs Group’s bank subsidiaries to remain sufficiently capitalized, by any examination downgrade of one of The Goldman Sachs Group’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of The Goldman Sachs Group’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, The Goldman Sachs Group is required to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” to maintain its status as a financial holding company. We have no ability to prevent such occurrences from happening.
 The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over us, including the power to prohibit us from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting our business. The Federal Reserve may approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for The Goldman Sachs Group and its subsidiaries to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, 
 17

regulations and orders. We do not believe that any of our current or anticipated business activities will require Federal Reserve approval.
 There are limits on the ability of The Goldman Sachs Group’s bank subsidiaries to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with us. In general, any loans to us from a bank subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group must be on market terms and secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited to 10% of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus. The Dodd-Frank Act places certain additional restrictions on transactions between us and The Goldman Sachs Group, which we do not believe are material to us.
