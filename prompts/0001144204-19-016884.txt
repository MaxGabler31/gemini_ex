Cincinnati Bancorp (the “Company”) is a federally-chartered corporation that was incorporated in October 2015 to be the mid-tier stock holding company for Cincinnati Federal in connection with the mutual holding company reorganization of Cincinnati Federal. The reorganization was completed on October 14, 2015. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $6.3 million. CF Mutual Holding Company is a federally chartered mutual holding company formed in October 2015 to become the mutual holding company of Cincinnati Bancorp in connection with the mutual holding company reorganization of Cincinnati Federal.

The executive offices of Cincinnati Bancorp are located at 6581 Harrison Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45247, and the telephone number is (513) 574-3025. Our website address is www.cincinnatifederal.com. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this annual report.
 
Cincinnati Bancorp is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $197.7 million, total deposits of $142.4 million and total equity of $23.0 million. We recorded net income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 

Cincinnati Federal is a federal savings bank headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the years, we have grown internally and we have also acquired a total of five mutual savings institutions, with our most recent acquisition occurring in 2018 with the acquisition of Kentucky Federal Savings and Loan Association effective October 12, 2018.
 
Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with borrowings and funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction and land loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the “FHLB-Cincinnati”) for asset/liability management purposes and for additional funding for our operations.
 
Cincinnati Federal also operates an active mortgage banking unit with nine mortgage loan officers, which originates loans both for sale into the secondary market and for retention in our portfolio. The revenue from gain on sales of loans was $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Cincinnati Federal is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by its primary federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
 
Market Area
 
We conduct our operations from our main office and three branch offices in Cincinnati, Ohio (Cincinnati) and two branch offices in Northern Kentucky. Hamilton County, Ohio represents our primary geographic market area for loans and deposits. Our business operations are conducted in the larger Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area which includes Warren, Butler and Clermont Counties in Ohio, Boone, Kenton and Campbell Counties in Kentucky, and Dearborn County, Indiana. We will, on occasion, make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary market. The local economy is diversified with services, trade and manufacturing employment being the most prominent employment sectors in Hamilton County. The employment base is diversified and there is no dependence on one area of the economy for continued employment. Major employers in the market include The Kroger Co., Catholic Healthcare Partners, The Procter & Gamble Company, the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, St. Elizabeth Healthcare, city and county governments, the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University. Our future growth opportunities will be influenced by the growth and stability of the regional, state and national economies, other demographic trends and the competitive environment. Hamilton County and Cincinnati have generally experienced a declining population since the 2000 census while the other counties in which we conduct business experienced population growth. The population decline in both Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati results from other counties and northern Kentucky being more successful in attracting new and existing businesses to locate within their areas through economic incentives, including less expensive real estate options for office facilities. Individuals are moving to these other areas to be closer to their place of employment, for newer, less expensive housing and more suburban neighborhoods.

Competition 
 
We face intense competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. We also face competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer and finance companies and, with respect to deposits, from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. As of June 30, 2018, based on the most recent available FDIC data, our market share of deposits represented 0.13% of FDIC-insured deposits in Hamilton County, ranking us 15th in deposit market share. This data does not include deposits held by credit unions.
Lending Activities 
 
General. Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction and land loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate commercial business loans and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to increase our focus on nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We also originate for sale and sell the majority of the fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate with terms of greater than 10 years, on both a servicing-retained and servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and generally all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. Loans are sold primarily to FHLB-Cincinnati, Freddie Mac or to private sector third party buyers.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that Cincinnati Federal is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Cincinnati Federal’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2018, based on the 15% limitation, Cincinnati Federal’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $3.7 million. On the same date, Cincinnati Federal had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. At December 31, 2018, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for approximately $2.0 million, secured by a nonresidential property, and was performing in accordance with its original terms on that date.

Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. We generally follow underwriting procedures that are consistent with Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines.
 
Under our loan policy, the loan underwriter of an application is responsible for ensuring proposals and approval of any extensions of credit are in compliance with internal policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations, and for establishing and maintaining credit files and documentation sufficient to support the loan and to perfect any collateral position. Loans originated for sale may be approved by any loan underwriter, if the loan conforms to the underwriting guidelines established by the investor to whom the loan will be sold.
 
Loans to be held in our portfolio may not be approved solely by an underwriter, and generally require review and approval by our Chief Lending Officer, members of the loan committee or the board of directors. All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. For one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate loans, our Chief Lending Officer, any two members of the loan committee or any one loan committee member and one underwriter are authorized to approve loans up to $424,100 in the aggregate.
 
For one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate, non-owner occupied one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate, commercial real estate, undeveloped lots or employee loans, any three members of the loan committee are authorized to approve up to $750,000 in the aggregate. The entire loan committee may approve loans up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate. For aggregate loans in excess of $1,000,000, approval of the board of directors is required.
 
For all other loans, our Chief Lending Officer or any two members of the loan committee are authorized to approve aggregate loans up to $50,000, with three loan committee members able to approve aggregate loans up to $250,000. As above, the approval of the full loan committee is required for loans up to $1,000,000 and approval of the board of directors is required for loans in excess of $1,000,000.
 
Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan.
 
One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $107.9 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate, representing 62.1% of our total loan portfolio. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans held in our portfolio due after December 31, 2019 were comprised of 20.97% fixed-rate loans, and 79.03% adjustable-rate loans.
 
Prior to 2010, we engaged in significant non-owner occupied one- to four-family real estate lending. Many of these loans were made to investors who owned a number of rental properties, and which did not provide sufficient rental cash flows to service the repayment of the loans. There is a greater credit risk inherent in non-owner occupied properties, than in owner occupied properties since, like nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower’s ability to lease the property. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing these loans or the revenues derived from these properties which could affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Beginning with the economic downturn that began in 2008, we experienced higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs in our non-owner occupied residential loan portfolio. Our management took steps to reduce our delinquent and non-performing assets in this portfolio, and to reduce this type of lending. See “—Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets” below. At December 31, 2018, we had $14.2 million of non-owner occupied residential loans.

We currently originate a small number of non-owner occupied residential loans. Non-owner occupied loans as a percentage of total loans have increased to 8.2% at December 31, 2018 from 7.6% at December 31, 2017. We impose strict underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including a maximum number of loans to the same borrower, local residency, and no prior bankruptcies and/or foreclosures. Properties securing non-owner occupied loans must be within 50 miles of a Cincinnati Federal branch office. We also generally limit loans on non-owner occupied properties to borrowers with no more than ten total rental properties as a way to mitigate the risks involved in lending to professional property investors.
 
Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Fannie Mae. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We also offer FHA, VA and Rural Housing Development loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. We use an underwriter with expertise in FHA/VA lending. With the exception of three residential loans totaling $1.0 million at December 31, 2018, all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans at that date are secured by properties located in our market area.
 
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our owner-occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 85% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower. In addition, we may make one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less, if the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. Non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are limited to an 80% loan-to-value ratio.
 
Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of up to 30 years, with non-owner occupied loans limited to a maximum term of 25 years. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of three, five or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin. In recent years, this margin has been between 2.75% and 3.25% over the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan.
 
Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase, the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to seven years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.
 
We also originate home equity lines of credit and fixed-term home equity loans. See “—Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.”
 
We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” on one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., generally loans with credit scores less than 660), except for loans originated for sale in the secondary market.
 
We currently offer a special residential mortgage program with preferred loan terms to new and existing medical physicians. This program includes (i) preferred treatment of new physician income with regard to positions offered or recently begun and (ii) mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio up to 95% to 100% without the need to obtain mortgage insurance for loans up to $600,000. Doctors licensed for at least one year or self-employed for at least two years may receive mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90% to 100% without the need to obtain mortgage insurance for loans up to $700,000 and 85% for loans greater than $700,000. The portfolio of loans originated under this program was $6.7 million as of December 31, 2018.

Nonresidential Real Estate and Multi-Family Lending. In recent years, we have increased our nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans. Our nonresidential real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, retail and mixed-use properties, and light industrial properties located in our primary market area. Our multi-family loans are secured primarily by apartment buildings. At December 31, 2018, we had $18.9 million in nonresidential real estate loans and $27.1 million in multi-family real estate loans, representing 10.9% and 15.6% of our total loan portfolio, respectively.
 
Most of our nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans have a maximum term of up to 25 years. The interest rates on nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans are generally fixed for an initial period of three, five or seven years and adjust annually thereafter based on the One Year Treasury Rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our nonresidential real estate loans is generally 75% while multi-family real estate loans have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. All loan-to-value ratios are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines. At December 31, 2018, our largest nonresidential real estate loan totaled $2.0 million and was secured by retail property. At that date, our largest multi-family real estate loan totaled $2.0 million and was secured by an apartment building. At December 31, 2018, both of these loans were performing in accordance with their original terms. Set forth below is information regarding our nonresidential real estate loans at December 31, 2018.
 

Type of Collateral | Number of Loans | | Balance | 
---------------------+-----------------+----+----------------+--
 | | | (In thousands) | 
General commercial | | 19 | | $ | 5,394 
Industrial/warehouse | | 9 | | | 3,761 
Retail/wholesale | | 17 | | | 6,330

We consider a number of factors in originating nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of nonresidential and multi-family real estate borrowers.
 
Loans secured by nonresidential and multi-family real estate generally are larger than one- to four-family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Nonresidential real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of nonresidential real estate loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general, including today’s economic recession. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. At December 31, 2018, we had one non-performing nonresidential real estate loan for $68,000. There were no non-performing multi-family loans.

Construction Lending and Land Loans. We make construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and, to a limited extent, loans to builders and commercial borrowers. We also make a limited amount of land loans to complement our construction lending activities, as such loans are generally secured by lots that will be used for residential development. Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment purposes. At December 31, 2018, our construction loans, including land loans, totaled $7.3 million, representing 4.2% of our total loan portfolio.
 
Loans to individuals for the construction of their residences are typically originated as construction/permanent loans, with a construction phase for up to 18 months. Upon completion of the construction phase, the loan automatically becomes a permanent loan. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential loans offered by us. During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of owner-occupied single-family construction loans is generally 80%, or higher if mortgage insurance is obtained. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential loans. Land loans are generally offered for terms of up to 5 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of land loans is 65% for developed lots and 50% for undeveloped land loans.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding residential construction loan was for $396,000 of which $314,000 was outstanding. This loan was performing according to its original terms at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, there were no residential construction loans that were 60 days or more delinquent.
 
Loans to builders for the construction of pre-sold and market (not pre-sold) homes typically run for up to 24 months. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential loans offered by us. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of pre-sold builder construction loans is generally 80%, and this ratio is reduced to 65% on market homes. Construction loans to builders require that financial statements and tax returns be supplied and reviewed annually. Additionally, we limit construction loans to builders to no more than two loans on market homes in one development at a time or more than one loan per builder at a time.
 
Loans for the construction of nonresidential or multi-family properties typically run for up to 18 months. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to nonresidential real estate loans offered by us. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of nonresidential or multi-family construction loans is generally 75%. Nonresidential real estate construction loans also have a 50% pre-leasing requirement. No such requirement is placed on multi-family construction loans.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding nonresidential or multi-family construction loan was $2.0 million on a veterinary center. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2018.
 
The application process for a construction loan includes a submission to Cincinnati Federal of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed or developed. These items are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property. Loans are based on the lesser of current appraised value and/or the cost of construction (land plus building). Our construction loan agreements generally provide that loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Outside independent licensed appraisers inspect the progress of the construction of the dwelling before disbursements are made.
 
Construction and land lending generally are made for relatively short terms. However, to the extent our construction loans are not made to owner-occupants of single-family homes, they are more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and the concentration of credit with a limited number of borrowers. Further, the nature of these loans is such that they are more difficult to evaluate and monitor. Our risk of loss on a construction or land loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value upon completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project with a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment and/or the possibility of having to make substantial investments to complete and sell the project. Because defaults in repayment may not occur during the construction period, it may be difficult to identify problem loans at an early stage.

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, which are generally made for owner-occupied homes, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residences. We generally offer these loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio (including senior liens on the collateral property) of 90% if the first mortgage is originated by Cincinnati Federal and 85% if the first mortgage is not originated by Cincinnati Federal. We currently offer home equity lines of credit for a period of ten years, and generally at rates tied to the prevailing prime interest rate. We also offer home equity lines of credit on non-owner occupied properties, where the first mortgage is also originated by us, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% for a maximum term of two years. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten in the same manner as our one- to four-family residential loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $11.4 million of home equity lines of credit and $1.6 million of fixed-term home equity loans, representing 6.5 % and 0.9% of our total loan portfolio, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had one home equity line of credit that was 30 days or more delinquent totaling $10,000.
 
Home equity lines of credit and fixed-term home equity loans have greater risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. Our interest is generally subordinated to the interest of the institution holding the first mortgage. Even where we hold the first mortgage, we face the risk that the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and costs of foreclosure and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers.
 
Commercial Business Loans. We have generally conducted very limited commercial business lending. The board of directors has authorized management to purchase up to $500,000 in commercial business loans from an unaffiliated commercial lender specializing in loans to physicians and other professionals in the medical field. These are installment loans amortizing over seven years and carry higher interest rates than traditional residential loans. These loans may be secured by liens on non-real estate business assets. These loans are often used for working capital, debt consolidation, equipment and other general business purposes. The loans to be purchased must be reviewed and found to be consistent with our loan policy and underwriting guidelines. As of December 31, 2018, we had acquired such loans in the aggregate amount of $416,000 or 0.2% of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, the loans were performing in accordance with their original terms.
Consumer Lending. To date, our consumer lending apart from home equity loans and lines of credit has been limited. At December 31, 2018, we had $796,000 of consumer loans outstanding, representing approximately 0.5% of our total loan portfolio. Of these loans, $681,000 was secured by investment securities.
Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
 
Lending activities are conducted primarily by our salaried loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations and by our loan officers. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates. We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys.
 
Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, we originate for sale and sell the majority of the fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate with terms of greater than 10 years, on a combination of servicing-retained and servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while generally retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.  Additionally, we consider the current interest rate environment in making decisions as to whether to hold the mortgage loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 million in loans held for sale.
 
From time to time, we may purchase or sell participation interests in loans. We underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $2.7 million and $2.8 million in loan participation interests that we purchased. At those dates, we had $2.6 million and $1.9 million in loan participation interests sold.
 
Historically, we generally do not purchase whole loans or loan participations from third parties to supplement our loan production. However, we have purchased loans from a commercial lender specializing in loans to physicians and other professional in the medical field. We may purchase additional loans from that lender in the future. See “—Commercial Business Loans.”

We generally sell our loans without recourse, except for customary representations and warranties provided in sales transactions. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for our servicing activities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold $54.4 million and $58.1 million, respectively, of mortgage loans. Some of the mortgage loans were sold on a servicing-released basis, and we retained servicing on certain of these loans. At December 31, 2018, we serviced $97.5 million of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originated and sold in the secondary market.
 
The following table sets forth our loan origination, purchase, sale and principal repayment activity during the periods indicated.

Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
 
Delinquency Procedures. When a loan payment becomes 20 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail a “right to cure” letter to the borrower and any co-makers and endorsers. If a loan payment becomes 90 days past due (or a borrower misses three consecutive payments, whichever occurs first), we send a demand letter and generally cease accruing interest. It is our policy to institute legal procedures for collection or foreclosure when a loan becomes 120 days past due, unless management determines that it is in the best interest of Cincinnati Federal to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure.
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned.  The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed.  Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.
 
Delinquent Loans. The following tables set forth our loan delinquencies, including nonaccrual loans, by type and amount at the dates indicated.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
 
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.

In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified or special mention assets (presented gross of allowance) at the dates indicated were as follows:

Doubtful assets | | — | | | — 
Loss assets | | — | | | — 
Total classified assets | $ | 3,590 | | $ | 4,056

 
Non-Performing Assets. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until the loans qualifies for return to accrual. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans are moved to non-accrual status in accordance with our policy, which is typically after 90 days of non-payment.

Other than $561,000 and $939,000 of loans designated as substandard, there were no other loans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused us serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
 
Interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $19,000 and $5,400, respectively. We recognized $3,500 for these loans in the year ended December 31, 2018 and we recognized no interest income for these loans for the year December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, all troubled debt restructurings were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. At December 31, 2017 one troubled debt restructuring totaling $14,000 was not performing in accordance with their restructured terms.
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings. We occasionally modify loans to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure.  We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in our best interest and increases the likelihood that we can collect the remaining principal balance. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates), to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. At December 31, 2018, we had nine loans totaling $1.4 million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings.
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
 

15
--

 

We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value could result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired.
 
Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation.
 
Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established. Typically for a nonperforming real estate loan in the process of collection, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using either the original independent appraisal, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors, or a new independent appraisal, or evaluation and related general or specific allowances for loan losses are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a nonperforming real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal or evaluation if it has not already been obtained. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired.
 
Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
 
General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the probable incurred losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.
 
As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Total | $ | 1,405 | | | | $ | 1,360 | | 

 
At December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.81% of total loans and 188.59% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans increased from $153,000 at December 31, 2017 to $745,000 at December 31, 2018 primarily due to the addition of $396,000 in loans classified as nonaccrual by Kentucky Federal. At December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.91% of total loans and 888.89% of nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan losses was $1.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. There were no net loan recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2018 and $4,000 in net loan recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, may request us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Investment Activities
 
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day, cyclical and long-term liquidity needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk within the parameters of our interest rate risk policy, and to generate a dependable flow of earnings within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity. We expect to initially invest a substantial portion of the proceeds of the offering in short-term and other investments, including U.S. government securities.

Our investment policy was adopted by the board of directors. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors. All investment decisions shall require the approval of at least three senior management members, one of which shall be the President or Chief Financial Officer. The Chairman of the Board is included in the senior management group for this purpose. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least monthly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the board of directors.
 
Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; corporate bonds and obligations; debt securities of state and municipalities; commercial paper; certificates of deposits in other financial institutions, and bank-owned life insurance.
 
At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of securities and obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2018, we owned $2,583,100 of FHLB-Cincinnati stock. As a member of FHLB-Cincinnati, we are required to purchase stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati, which stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.
 
Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio at the dates indicated, all of which consisted of pass-through mortgage-backed securities.

Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $629,000, which constituted our entire securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Cincinnati Federal. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, which are government-sponsored enterprises.
 
Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also may use borrowings, primarily FHLB-Cincinnati advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We do not accept brokered deposits, although we have the authority to do so.
 
We participate in the National CD Rateline Program as a wholesale source for certificates of deposit to supplement deposits generated through our retail banking operations. The Rateline Program provides an internet based listing service which connects financial institutions such as Cincinnati Federal with other financial institutions for jumbo certificates of deposit. Deposits obtained through the Rateline Program are not considered to be brokered deposits. At December 31, 2018, approximately $13.1 million of our certificates of deposit, representing 9.2% of our total deposits, had been obtained through the Rateline Program. At December 31, 2018, these certificates of deposit had an average term to maturity of 14 months. Early withdrawal of these deposits is not permitted, which makes these accounts a more stable source of funds.
 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of Cincinnati Federal in the community to attract and retain deposits. We recently implemented a fully functional electronic banking platform, including mobile app and on-line bill pay, as a service to our deposit customers.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Our ability to gather deposits is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products.

Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati by pledging as security our capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati and certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. Recently, we have lengthened the maturities of our some of our FHLB advance borrowings to reduce interest rate risk. At December 31, 2018, we had $28.6 million of FHLB-Cincinnati advances (net of deferred prepayment penalties). Most of these advances had interest rates ranging from 1.01% to 3.12%. In addition to funding portfolio loans, we sometimes use FHLB-Cincinnati advances for short-term funding needs arising from our mortgage-banking activities.
 
In addition to the availability of FHLB-Cincinnati advances we also have a total of $11.5 million in lines of credit available from three commercial banks. No amount was outstanding on these lines of credit at December 31, 2018.

Subsidiary Activities 
 
Cincinnati Federal is the only subsidiary of Cincinnati Bancorp. Cincinnati Federal Investment Services, LLC, the subsidiary of Cincinnati Federal, is currently inactive.
 
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 
General 
 

As a savings and loan holding company, Cincinnati Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Office of Thrift Supervision’s functions relating to savings and loan holding companies were transferred to the Federal Reserve Board on July 21, 2011 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory restructuring. Cincinnati Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
As a federal savings association, Cincinnati Federal is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as its deposit insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Cincinnati Federal may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
Cincinnati Federal also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the “Federal Reserve Board,” which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, Cincinnati Federal is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB- Cincinnati, which is one of the eleven regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Cincinnati Federal’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Cincinnati Federal’s loan documents.
 
Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Cincinnati Bancorp, Cincinnati Federal and their operations.

Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank/Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (the Dodd-Frank Act”) made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Cincinnati Federal, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. 
 
Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Cincinnati Federal may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts. Cincinnati Federal may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Cincinnati Federal, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Capital Requirements. The FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more and all top-tier savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more.

25
--

 

The rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.
 
The rule also includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a two-year transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period. Cincinnati Federal had the one-time option in the first quarter of 2015 to permanently opt out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in its capital calculation. Cincinnati Federal elected to opt out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in its capital calculation.
 
The new capital requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 day past due or otherwise on non-accrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.
 
Finally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 
At December 31, 2018, Cincinnati Federal’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2018, Cincinnati Federal was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, Cincinnati Federal must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, Cincinnati Federal must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.
 
Cincinnati Federal also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 
A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2018, Cincinnati Federal satisfied the QTL test.
 
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:

26
--


· | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Cincinnati Federal, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 
A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:
 

· | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form.
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Cincinnati Federal received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Cincinnati Federal. Cincinnati Bancorp is an affiliate of Cincinnati Federal because of its control of Cincinnati Federal. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Federal regulations require savings associations to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.

Cincinnati Federal’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

· | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Cincinnati Federal’s capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Cincinnati Federal’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 
Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. The OCC is required by law to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.
 
Under the OCC’s prompt corrective action regulations, undercapitalized institutions become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital decreases. Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings association, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
 
The OCC’s prompt corrective action standards changed with the new capital ratios. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have to have a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. We have determined that the Bank is well-capitalized under these standards as of December 31, 2018.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts.  The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as Cincinnati Federal. Deposit accounts in Cincinnati Federal are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Cincinnati Federal. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.14 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Cincinnati Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB-Cincinnati, Cincinnati Federal is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2018, Cincinnati Federal was in compliance with this requirement.
Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve Board regulations require banks to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts. For 2019, a 3% reserve ratio for aggregate transaction accounts up to $124.2 million, a 10% ratio above $124.2 million, and an exemption of $16.3 million was established.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Cincinnati Bancorp and CF Mutual Holding Company are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Cincinnati Bancorp and CF Mutual Holding Company are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Cincinnati Bancorp, CF Mutual Holding Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of Cincinnati Bancorp and CF Mutual Holding Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Cincinnati Bancorp and CF Mutual Holding Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5.0% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior regulatory approval. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5.0% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
 

· | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Capital. Savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital, which is currently permitted for bank holding companies. Instruments that were issued by May 19, 2010 are grandfathered in for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception for bank holding companies of less than $500 million in assets, and the Federal Reserve Board has adopted final rules that impose a capital requirement on bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1.0 billion or more.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all Association and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

Dividends. Cincinnati Federal is required to notify the Federal Reserve Board thirty days before declaring any dividend to Cincinnati Bancorp. The financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the regulator and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution.
Waivers of Dividends by CF Mutual Holding Company. If Cincinnati Bancorp pays any dividends on its common stock, it would be required to pay dividends to CF Mutual Holding Company unless CF Mutual Holding Company receives the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to waive the receipt of any dividends from Cincinnati Bancorp. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the subsidiary savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous six months. There can be no assurance that a dividend waiver request by CF Mutual Holding Company would be approved by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, any dividends waived by CF Mutual Holding Company would have to be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of CF Mutual Holding Company to stock form.
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
Federal Securities Laws
 
Cincinnati Bancorp’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Cincinnati Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Cincinnati Bancorp qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
 
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, Cincinnati Bancorp will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Cincinnati Bancorp has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
 
A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

TAXATION
 Federal Taxation
 
General. Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal.
 
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Cincinnati Bancorp and its subsidiary uses a tax year ending December 31st and files a consolidated federal tax return. The Company reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. Cincinnati Federal is not currently under audit with respect to its federal income tax return from prior years.
 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry a net operating loss forward indefinitely for losses generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017. Cincinnati Bancorp had $666,155 of federal net loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018 that expire between 2028 and 2037 and $467,657 with no expiration.
Capital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2018, Cincinnati Bancorp had no capital loss carryovers.
Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Cincinnati Federal as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
State Taxation
 
Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal are subject to Ohio taxation in the same general manner as other financial institutions. In particular, Cincinnati Bancorp and Cincinnati Federal file a consolidated Ohio Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”) return. The FIT is based upon the net worth of the consolidated group. For Ohio FIT purposes, savings institutions are currently taxed at a rate equal to 0.8% of taxable net worth. Cincinnati Bancorp is not currently under audit with respect to its Ohio FIT returns.
