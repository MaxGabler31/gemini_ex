Item 1. Business
Overview
Zuora provides a cloud-based subscription management platform, built to help companies monetize new services and operate dynamic, recurring revenue business models. Our solution enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage and scale a subscription business, automating the entire quote-to-revenue process, including quoting, billing, collections and revenue recognition. With Zuora’s solution, businesses can change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, analyze customer data to optimize their subscription offerings, and build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.
Many of today’s enterprise software systems manage their quote-to-revenue processes using software built for one-time transactions. These systems were not designed for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription, usage, or consumption-based pricing models, and can be extremely difficult to configure. In traditional product-based businesses, quote-to-revenue was a linear process—a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue is recognized. These legacy product-based systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities of ongoing customer relationships and recurring revenue, commonly found in a subscription business, and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, reporting in real-time, and the lifetime value of the customer. Using legacy or homegrown software to build a subscription business often results in inefficient processes with prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, and a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs).
However, enterprise business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions, flexible pricing, global complexities, and continuously-evolving relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and analyze data to drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies that operate at a global scale. As a result, as companies launch, grow, and scale their businesses, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate. That’s where Zuora comes in.
Our vision is “The World Subscribed” -- the idea that one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy. Our focus has been on providing the technology our customers need to thrive as a customer-centric, recurring revenue business. 
Our solution includes Zuora Central Platform, Zuora Billing, Zuora Revenue, Zuora Collect, and other software that support and expand upon these core products. Our software helps companies analyze data - including information such as which customers are delivering the most recurring revenue, or which segments are showing the highest churn, enabling customers to make informed decisions for their subscription business and quickly implement changes such as launching new services, updating pricing (usage, time, or outcome based), delivering new offerings, or making other changes to their customers’ subscription experience. We also have a large subscription ecosystem of global partners and the Subscribed Strategy Group, that can assist our customers with additional strategies and services throughout the subscription journey.
Companies in a variety of industries - technology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, telecommunications, and many others - are using our solution to scale and adapt to a world that is increasingly choosing subscription-based offerings. Our customers include over 25 of the Fortune 100 and 12 of the top 15 auto manufacturers.
Business Benefits of Using Our Solution
Zuora’s products enable companies to:
•Monetize for Their Business Models. Zuora helps companies to transform their existing product-centric business models into customer-centric services to take advantage of the predictability and resilience of recurring revenue business models.
•Reduce Time to Market. Zuora significantly reduces the time required to go-to-market with new offerings and to iterate on the pricing and packaging of existing offerings, enabling businesses to quickly react to changing market and customer needs, launch new services, and enter new markets. Changes can be made in minutes without having to re-code or re-engineer back office systems.
•Increase Operational Efficiencies. Customers regularly make changes to their subscriptions. Zuora automates these processes and reduces the impact of changes across quote-to-cash and revenue recognition, including proration for invoices, changes to revenue recognition, taxation, provisioning, and reporting. Automating these functions saves businesses valuable time and resources by eliminating manual processes and customizations and increasing operational efficiencies.
•Free Up IT and Engineering Resources. Our cloud-based solution reduces both system complexity and costs. With Zuora, engineering and IT departments no longer need to build in-house custom systems or customizations for their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to keep up with market changes, ongoing customer demands, and new quote-to-revenue processes.
•Establish a Single System of Record. Our solution captures financial and operational data and enables businesses to have a single system of record rather than having to reconcile data from multiple systems. Key business metrics can be accessed at any point in time to make critical business decisions.
•Make Customer Data-Driven Decisions. Because our solution serves as a single source of data and information for subscribers, companies can use Zuora to gain insight into subscriber data and behavior. This helps them understand their subscribers better, predict up-sell opportunities, and increase customer retention.
•Access Growing Ecosystem of Quote-to-Revenue Software Partners. Our solution has over 50 pre-built connectors to various quote-to-revenue software partners, including payment gateways, tax vendors, general ledgers, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Rather than building integrations for each of these, our customers can take advantage of pre-built connectors to extend the capabilities of Zuora for specific industries.
•Support Rapid International Expansion. With over 35 pre-built payment gateways, over 150 supported currencies, and over 15 supported payment methods, our solution enables companies to quickly expand internationally and acquire and support customers in new countries. 
•Manage Complex Revenue Streams. In light of the accounting complexities associated with recurring revenue models, our revenue recognition product automates revenue recognition processes in compliance with accounting standards and reduces our customers’ reliance on error-prone manual processing and spreadsheets.
Products
Our solution enables companies to monetize their business model by automating their quote-to-revenue operations. We can deploy and configure our portfolio of products to meet a wide variety of use cases for companies with a subscription, consumption-based, or hybrid business models. 
We offer four flagship products:
•Zuora Central Platform. Our Zuora Central Platform acts as an orchestration engine for all subscription data and processes, allowing customers to power their quote-to-revenue operations and customer experiences for subscription business models. Our Zuora Central Platform provides the following capabilities:
◦Integrated data model enabling customers to manage their subscribers and easily set up and iterate products, subscribers, subscriptions, rate plans, payment methods and other data necessary to orchestrate the subscriber experiences. 
◦Enterprise-grade capabilities for security, compliance, and tenant management as well as capabilities to integrate to any relevant enterprise application such as configure-price-quote (CPQ), e-commerce, customer portal, and general ledger. 
◦Develop tools that enable customers and system integrators to customize and extend the functionality of the platform, including workflow, custom objects, data queries, and test environments.
◦Analytics and reporting to provide customers insights from their subscriber data and related activity across the subscriber lifecycle, including out-of-the-box subscription metrics such as monthly recurring revenue (MRR), annual contract value (ACV), and customer churn.
•Zuora Billing. Zuora Billing allows our customers to deploy a variety of pricing and packaging strategies to monetize their business models, to efficiently and accurately bill customers, to calculate prorations when subscriptions change, and to automate billing and payment operations. The product also helps our customers set payment terms, manage hierarchical billing relationships, consolidate invoicing across multiple subscriptions, and tax transactions. Zuora Billing also includes our Zuora CPQ module, which enables customers to configure, price, and quote a wide variety of subscription transactions, including complex arrangements such as multi-year subscriptions, and price ramps. The Zuora CPQ module also uses a rules engine and guided selling workflows to help customers scale their sales teams.
•Zuora Revenue. Zuora Revenue is a revenue recognition automation solution that revenue accounting teams use to manage their complex revenue streams. Zuora Revenue helps our customers automate revenue and deferred revenue management in accordance with their accounting policies, business rules, and pricing models, including support for complex scenarios around standalone selling price (SSP) analysis for determining the fair value of the individual goods and services sold and cost management accounting and amortization for all costs incurred as part of obtaining or fulfilling a contract with a customer.
•Zuora Collect. Specifically designed to handle the complicated function of payments associated with dynamic subscription-based businesses, Zuora Collect helps our customers streamline and optimize their payments and collections processes. Zuora Collect enables customers to utilize a global network of payment gateways, configure their own automated dunning workflows, orchestrating various retry rules for electronic payments, and understand the root cause of a payment decline. We recently announced the addition of machine learning capabilities to the automated dunning capabilities of Zuora Collect to improve overall electronic payments success rates and reduce involuntary churn.

Organizations of all sizes, across a wide variety of industries and in many locations around the world, have adopted our solution. As of January 31, 2022, we had 747 customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000, representing over 90% of our total ACV. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 676 and 624 customers, respectively, with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. For more information on ACV, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operational and Financial Metrics.”
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell to organizations of different sizes across a broad range of industries. We work with companies that are launching, transforming, and scaling new recurring revenue business models, with a focus on enterprise-scale businesses, or fast growing companies with the potential to achieve enterprise scale.
We have an enterprise sales model supported by a field sales organization. Because of the transformative nature of our solution, especially in larger organizations, the selling process is often complex and can involve agreement across multiple departments inside an organization, including the chief executive officer. Over the years, we have developed methodologies and best practices to assist our sales teams in navigating these challenges and have built these learnings into our sales enablement and training to assist with onboarding and productivity of new sales account executives. We believe our sales methodologies and processes offer us significant advantages, particularly in long enterprise sales-cycles. Our sales teams are organized by geographic territories, customer size, and customer verticals. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our enterprise customer base, both domestically and internationally.
We conduct a wide range of account-based marketing activities such as virtual webinars and online events; partner marketing with our system integrators, consultants, and ecosystem partners; the Subscription Economy Index, our study of the collective health of subscription businesses and their impact on the overall economy; and as educational content, data-based benchmarks and best practices sharing for the Subscription Economy in a variety of formats such as digital, print, and video on Zuora.com and Subscribed.com.
In fiscal 2021, we announced the Subscribed Strategy Group (SSG), which works directly with individual companies and helps them apply expertise attained from the Subscribed Institute’s research to their specific business needs. The SSG works one-on-one with executives from our customer organizations to chart a strategic path towards subscription success by identifying and removing business obstacles, building internal alignment, and establishing routes to success. Best practices developed from our work with over a thousand subscription companies around the world help our customers make critical business decisions, adopt new strategies, and measure their success at regular intervals.
As newer markets emerge domestically and internationally, we plan to continue investing in our sales and marketing to grow our customer base.
Competition
The market for subscription management products and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. 
Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
•providers of traditional ERP software, such as Oracle Corporation and SAP SE;
•providers of CRM applications such as Salesforce; 
•traditional quote-to-revenue solutions that address individual elements of the subscription revenue process, such as traditional CPQ management, billing, collections, revenue recognition, or e-commerce software;
•niche billing systems for telecommunications, such as Amdocs Limited;

•smaller point solution providers; and
•in-house custom built systems.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•subscription and consumption-based product features and functionality;
•ability to support the specific needs of companies with subscription or consumption business models, or combinations of these various complex business models;
•ease of use;
•vision for the market and product innovation;

We believe we compete favorably against our competitors with respect to these factors. Our ability to compete will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
Human Capital
People and Culture
Zuora aims to recruit, develop and engage a diverse, high performing, and inclusive workforce. Our culture is rooted in the premise that our employees, whom we call “ZEOs”, are CEOs of their careers. We value authenticity, empowerment and accountability for ZEOs to chart their own paths in achieving Zuora's mission to power the Subscription Economy. Our culture is key to our success and we strive to create an environment that fosters a collaborative, fun, high performing and inclusive culture where ZEOs can achieve individual and team objectives. As of January 31, 2022, we had 1,393 employees, including 671, or 48%, located outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Asia and Australia.
Employee Well-Being and Engagement 
The overall well-being of our employees is important to us and is an integral part of our company culture. Our global well-being programs include a practice of remote working arrangements, flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance. In addition, we ensure ongoing check-ins with employees by managers to provide additional channels of support and career development. We also regularly seek input from employees, including through broad employee satisfaction surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. 
Diversity and Inclusion
As a global company, we embrace the diversity of our employees, partners, customers, other stakeholders and the communities we collectively serve. We are committed to developing a diverse and thriving workforce and inclusive ZEO culture. We seek and embrace people who bring diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences and believe this is critical to our success. We continue to build diversity, equity and inclusion into our culture with a focus on creating environments and practices that mitigate bias and allow our employees to be their authentic selves in performing their best work at Zuora.
Our ZEO employee resource groups (ERGs) play a key role in this effort. Our ERGs are ZEO-led groups open to all ZEOs that aim to elevate the experiences and interests of underrepresented groups in our workforce. Some ERG examples include our Asian American and Pacific Islander ZEOs, Z-Vets, Out at Zuora, Zuora Familia, Zuora Black Network, and Z-Women.
We also foster multiple ongoing educational opportunities and events, including panels, Community Conversations, ZED Talks, and Z-Briefs, for every employee to have open, ongoing conversations across teams and with senior leaders. These are opportunities for dedicated time for continuous learning as well as feedback to help improve our workplace and culture, while also increasing connection and belonging across our globally-distributed workforce. 
Our executive management team is currently composed of 27% women, and 36% who self-identify as coming from certain underrepresented groups. In addition, our Board of Directors is made up of highly skilled individuals from the technology and business sectors. Women represent 40% of our Board of Directors and 40% of our Board of Directors identify as members of certain underrepresented groups. 
Learning and Development
We believe that investing in the growth and development of our ZEOs will directly enhance our overall company performance. As owners of their careers, ZEOs are encouraged to invest regularly in their own professional development. In support of this, we offer mentorship programs, leadership programs, and other Z-Grow employee training programs, which are designed to help ZEOs develop and manage their careers, drive accountability, and promote a culture of continuous feedback. Additionally, through our Career Cash program, we reimburse ZEOs for costs related to pursuing learning and professional development opportunities.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
We strive to provide pay, comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our ZEOs. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, including equity compensation, paid time off, and other comprehensive and competitive global benefits. For example, in the United States, we provide 26 weeks of paid parental leave for new parents who have been employed with us for at least six months. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align ZEO interests with our stockholders' interests, we offer equity compensation under our broad-based stock incentive programs. We also offer the opportunity for eligible ZEOs in the United States and many international locations to participate in our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).
Social Impact
We encourage our ZEOs to give back to the causes that matter to them. Zuora is a member of the Pledge 1% movement and we are committed to leveraging our employees' time and talent to make the communities where we live and work stronger. To facilitate our Pledge 1% initiative, we have empowered our employees with the tools and resources they need to create local Z-Philanthropy chapters at our offices worldwide. Through our Z-Philanthropy chapters, ZEOs in our offices across the globe step up to lead giving and volunteering efforts throughout the year and create lasting partnerships with local nonprofits through these employee-led groups. In addition to the sustained efforts of our local Z-Philanthropy chapters, we host an annual Global Month of Service where ZEOs worldwide participate in volunteer and fundraising events. In fiscal 2022, our ZEOs volunteered over 2,400 hours of their time to mission-aligned nonprofits. 
Additionally, Zuora donated $1.0 million of common stock in fiscal 2022 to the Zuora Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund managed by the Tides Foundation, and we expect to continue to make similar share contributions in the future. The Tides Foundation uses the share proceeds to make charitable donations to a wide variety of nonprofits helping communities around the world. During fiscal 2022, we launched an annual employee matching gifts program under which the Zuora Impact Fund matched up to $1,000 per ZEO based on their charitable donations, volunteer time, or a combination of the two. 
Intellectual Property
We primarily rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2022, in the United States, we held 19 issued patents that expire between 2033 and 2039, and had 24 patent applications pending. We also held two issued patents in Australia that expire in 2032 and 2039 (absent any extensions), and had nine patent applications pending in other foreign jurisdictions. We also pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2022, we had nine registered trademarks in the United States, including Zuora, Subscription Economy, Subscribed, and Powering the Subscription Economy. We also had 19 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties in connection with the disclosure of our confidential information.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, security and protection, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities and tax. In addition, our clients in heavily regulated industries and the public sector may be subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration requirements and performance of contracts which affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas likely will be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on ways we operate our business.
New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, products, services, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional products and services, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. We believe we are currently in material compliance with laws and regulations to which we are subject and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect.
See the section titled “Risk Factors— We are required to comply with governmental export control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
