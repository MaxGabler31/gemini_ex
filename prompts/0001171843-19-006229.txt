ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a leading industrial biotechnology company that applies its technology platform to engineer, manufacture and sell high performance, natural, sustainably-sourced products into the Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance markets. Our proven technology platform enables us to rapidly engineer microbes and use them as catalysts to metabolize renewable, plant-sourced sugars into large volume, high-value ingredients. Our biotechnology platform and industrial fermentation process replace existing complex and expensive manufacturing processes. We have successfully used our technology to develop and produce eight distinct molecules at commercial volumes, leading to more than 15 commercial ingredients used by thousands of leading global brands.
 
We believe that industrial biotechnology represents a third industrial revolution, bringing together biology and engineering to generate new, more sustainable materials to meet the growing global demand for bio-based replacements for petroleum-based and traditional animal- or plant-derived ingredients. We continue to build demand for our current portfolio of products through an extensive sales network provided by our collaboration partners that represent the leading companies in the world for our target market sectors. We also have a small group of direct sales and distributors who support our Clean Beauty market. Via our partnership model, our partners invest in the development of each molecule to bring it from the lab to commercial scale and use their extensive sales forces to sell our ingredients and formulations to their customers as part of their core business. We capture long-term revenue both through the production and sale of the molecule to our partners and through royalty revenues from our partners' product sales to their customers.
 
We were founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay area by a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Our first major milestone came in 2005 when, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid, which is a precursor of artemisinin, an effective anti-malarial drug. In 2008, we granted royalty-free licenses to allow Sanofi S.A. to produce artemisinic acid using our technology. Building on our success with artemisinic acid, in 2007 we began applying our technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell sustainable alternatives to a broad range of markets.
 
We focused our initial development efforts primarily on the production of Biofene®, our brand of renewable farnesene, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes. Our farnesene derivatives are sold in thousands of products as nutraceuticals, skincare products, fragrances, solvents, polymers, and lubricant ingredients. The commercialization of farnesene pushed us to create a more cost efficient, faster and accurate development process in the lab and drive manufacturing costs down. This investment has enabled our technology platform to rapidly develop microbial strains and commercialize target molecules. In 2014, we began manufacturing additional molecules for the Flavor & Fragrance industry. In 2015, we began investing to expand our capabilities to other small molecule chemical classes beyond terpenes, which comprised our initial research efforts, via our collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2016 we expanded into the production of proteins.


We have invested over $600 million in infrastructure and technology to create microbes that produce molecules from sugar or other feedstocks at commercial scale. This platform has been used to design, build, optimize and upscale strains producing eight distinct molecules at commercial volumes, leading to more than 15 commercial ingredients used by thousands of leading global brands. Our time to market for molecules has decreased from seven years to potentially less than a year, mainly due to our ability to leverage the technology platform we have built.
 
Our technology platform has been in active use since 2007 and has been integrated with our commercial production since 2011, creating an organism development process that we believe makes us an industry leader in the successful scale-up and commercialization of biotech-produced ingredients. The key performance characteristics of our platform that we believe differentiate us include our proprietary computational tools, strain construction tools, screening and analytics tools, and advanced lab automation and data integration. Full integration of the platform with our large-scale manufacturing capability enables us to engineer precisely with the end specification and commercial production requirements guiding our developments. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry-leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, California, pilot scale production facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration-scale facility in Campinas, Brazil and a commercial-scale production facility in Leland, North Carolina, which is owned and operated by our Aprinnova joint venture to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products.

We are able to use a wide variety of feedstocks for production, but have focused on accessing Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its renewability, low cost and relative price stability.
 
Several years ago, we made the strategic decision to transition our business model from developing and commercializing molecules in low margin commodity markets to higher margin specialty markets. We began the transition by commercializing and supplying farnesene-derived squalane as a cosmetic ingredient sold to formulators and distributors. We then entered into collaboration and supply agreements for the development and commercialization of molecules within the Flavor & Fragrance and Clean Beauty markets where we utilize our strain generation technology to develop molecules that meet the customer’s rigorous specifications.
 
During this transition, we solidified the business model of partnering with our customers to create sustainable, high performing, low-cost molecules that replace an ingredient in their supply chain, commercially scale and manufacture those molecules, and share in the profits earned by our customers once our customers sell their products into these specialty markets. These three steps constitute our collaboration revenues, renewable product revenues, and royalty revenues.
 
In 2017, we decided to monetize the use of one of our lower margin molecules, farnesene, in certain fields of use while retaining any associated royalties. We began discussions with our partners and ultimately made the decision to license farnesene to Koninklijke DSM N.V. (DSM) for use in these fields. We also sold to DSM our subsidiary Amyris Brasil Ltda. (Amyris Brasil), which owned and operated the purpose-built, large-scale manufacturing facility in Brotas, Brazil that manufactures farnesene, a key, biobased intermediate ingredient in certain of our products, in 2017.
 
The Brotas facility was built to batch manufacture one commodity product at a time (originally for high-volume production of biofuels, a business we have exited), which is an inefficient manufacturing process that is not suited for the high margin specialty markets in which we operate today. The inefficiencies we experienced at the Brotas facility included idling the facility for two weeks at a time to prepare for the next product batch manufacture. These inefficiencies caused a significant increase in our cost of goods sold. We are in the process of constructing a new purpose-built, large-scale production facility in Brazil (see the Manufacturing section below), which we anticipate will allow for the manufacture of five products concurrently and over 10 different products annually. As part of the December 2017 sale of the Brotas facility, we contracted with DSM for the use of the Brotas facility to manufacture products for us to fulfill our product supply commitments to our customers until our new production facility becomes operational. In September 2019, we obtained the necessary permits and broke ground on our Specialty Ingredients Plant (SIP).  We expect the facility to be fully operational in Q1 of 2021.  This facility will allow us to manufacture five products at once and to produce both our specialty ingredients portfolio and our new sweetener product.


As discussed above, on December 28, 2017, we completed the sale of Amyris Brasil, which operated our Brotas production facility, to DSM and concurrently entered into a series of commercial agreements and a credit agreement with DSM. At closing, we received $33.0 million in contractual cash consideration for the capital stock of Amyris Brasil, which was subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments and reimbursements from DSM contingent on DSM’s utilization of certain Brazilian tax benefits it acquired with its purchase of Amyris Brasil. We used $12.6 million of the cash proceeds received to repay certain indebtedness of Amyris Brasil. The total fair value of the contractual consideration received in connection with the sales agreement for Amyris Brasil was $56.9 million and resulted in a pretax gain of $5.7 million from continuing operations, recognized in fiscal 2017.

Concurrent with the sale of Amyris Brasil, we entered into a series of commercial agreements with DSM including (i) a license agreement to DSM of our farnesene product for DSM to use in the Vitamin E and Lubricants specialty markets; (ii) a royalty agreement, pursuant to which DSM agreed to pay us specified royalties representing a portion of the profit on the sale of Vitamin E produced from farnesene sold under the supply agreement with Nenter & Co., Inc. (“Nenter”) assigned to DSM; (iii) a performance agreement to perform research and development to optimize farnesene for production and sale of farnesene products; and (iv) a transition services agreement in which we provided finance, legal, logistics, and human resource services to support the Brotas facility under DSM ownership for a six-month period with a DSM option to extend for six additional months. At closing, DSM paid to us a nonrefundable license fee of $27.5 million and a nonrefundable minimum royalty revenue payment of $15.0 million. DSM also agreed to pay the Company nonrefundable minimum royalty amounts in 2018 and 2019. The future nonrefundable minimum annual royalty payments were determined to be fixed and determinable with a fair value of $17.8 million and were included as part of the total arrangement consideration subject to allocation of this overall multiple-element divestiture transaction. In November 2018 and April 2019, we amended the supply agreement with DSM and entered into various other agreements with DSM. See Note 10, “Revenue Recognition”, Note 11, "Related Party Transactions" and Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full listing and details of agreements with DSM.
 
In the second quarter of 2018, we successfully demonstrated our industrial process at full scale to produce a high-purity, zero calorie sweetener derived from sugarcane. We believe that the molecule we are producing from sugarcane, Reb M, is one of the leading natural sweeteners. When derived from the Stevia plant, Reb M is found in very limited quantities along with many impurities that leave an unacceptable taste in the mouth of the consumer. The Reb M that we produce from sugarcane is more sustainable and lower cost than other natural sweeteners, and has a specific technical profile that we believe is advantaged in taste and total process economics for blends and formulations. In December 2018, we received notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) that we received its "Generally Regarded As Safe" designation concurrence, and began producing commercial quantities of Reb M at DSM’s Brotas facility during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
In June and December 2018, we and our contract manufacturer, Antibióticos de León (ADL), executed amendments to our January 2018 production agreement, thereby providing us additional tank capacity at ADL’s production facility in León, Spain. These amendments provide additional, cost-effective manufacturing capability to meet higher than expected product demand from our partners. The amended agreement includes a commitment to running a certain number of batches at ADL’s production facility from the period September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 for up to four of our products.


On June 29, 2018, we closed a $36 million term loan with Great American Capital Partners, LLC (GACP), a subsidiary of B. Riley Capital Management, LLC, an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and wholly-owned subsidiary of B. Riley Financial, Inc. The term loan matures on July 1, 2021, subject to certain early maturity conditions. The net proceeds from the term loan were used to pay off the Company’s senior secured loan facility with Stegodon Corporation and the related party convertible promissory note issued to Total Raffinage Chimie (as assignee of Total Energies Nouvelles Activités USA) (Total) in March 2016. The term loan also includes an additional $35 million accordion credit facility that provides us with another option for financing construction of our planned production facility in Brazil, if necessary. See Note 5, "Debt" and Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
 
In the second quarter of 2018, we executed an agreement for a significant project consortium in Europe with the Universidade Católica Portuguesa (UCP) Porto Campus and AICEP Portugal Global (AICEP). UCP is a university system, including the leading biotech school in Portugal, and operates 15 research centers. AICEP is an independent public entity of the Government of Portugal, focused in encouraging foreign companies to invest in Portugal. In conjunction with this agreement, we opened a subsidiary in Porto, Portugal. The primary purpose of this subsidiary is to conduct a research and development project together with Escola Superior de Biotecnologia o Universidade Católica Portuguese. This subsidiary will be the second R&D center of Amyris and will be responsible for certain areas of research, namely valorization of fermentation residues and wastes and the advancement of the Company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Informatics platform. The overall multi-year project is valued up to approximately $50 million including investment funding and incentives allotted across the parties involved. We have sole responsibility for commercialization and majority ownership of all intellectual property (IP) generated. We believe this is the largest biotechnology grant ever awarded in Portugal and one of the largest ever approved by the AICEP for commercial applications.

In the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement for our new, sugarcane-derived, zero calorie sweetener with ASR Group, the world’s largest cane sugar refiner. Also in the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with a subsidiary of Yifan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which is one of the leading Chinese pharmaceutical companies. Such license and collaboration agreement was expanded in November 2018.
 
On December 10, 2018, we closed the offering and sale of an aggregate of $60 million of convertible notes to two investors in a private placement. The notes mature on December 10, 2021. See Note 5, "Debt" and Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
 
On May 2, 2019, we consummated a $300 million research, collaboration and license agreement (the Cannabinoid Agreement) with LAVVAN, Inc., a newly formed investment-backed company (Lavvan), for the development, manufacture and commercialization of cannabinoids. Under the agreement, the Company will perform research and development activities and Lavvan will be responsible for the commercialization of the cannabinoids developed under the agreement. The Cannabinoid Agreement is being principally funded on a milestone basis, with the Company also entitled to receive certain supplementary research and development funding from Lavvan. The Company could receive aggregate funding of up to $300 million over the term of the Cannabinoid Agreement if all of the milestones are achieved. Additionally, the agreement provides for royalties to the Company on Lavvan's gross profit margin once products are commercialized; these payments will be due for the next 20 years. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Cannabinoid Agreement included the formation of a special purpose entity to hold certain intellectual property created during the collaboration (the Cannabinoid Collaboration IP), the licensing of certain Company intellectual property to Lavvan, the licensing of the Cannabinoid Collaboration IP to the Company and Lavvan, and the granting by the Company to Lavvan of a lien on our background intellectual property being licensed to Lavvan under the Cannabinoid Agreement, which would be subordinated to the lien on such intellectual property under the GACP Term Loan Facility (see Note 5, “Debt”).
 
On May 10, 2019, the Company and Raizen Energia S.A. (Raizen) entered into an agreement relating to the formation and operation of a joint venture relating to the production, sale and commercialization of alternative sweetener products. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, among other things, (i) the joint venture will construct a manufacturing facility on land owned by Raizen and leased to the joint venture (the Sweetener Plant), (ii) the Company will grant to the joint venture an exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, license to certain technology owned by the Company relevant to the joint venture’s business, and (iii) the Company and Raizen will enter into a shareholders agreement setting forth the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to, and the management of, the joint venture. The formation of the joint venture is subject to certain conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and the achievement of certain technological and economic milestones relating to the Company’s existing production of its alternative sweetener product. If such conditions are not satisfied by December 31, 2019, the joint venture will automatically terminate. In addition, notwithstanding the satisfaction of the closing conditions, Raizen may elect not to consummate the formation and operation of the joint venture, in which event, the Company will retain the right to construct and operate the Sweetener Plant.


Technology
 
We have developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that allow us to transform the way microbes metabolize sugars. Specifically, we engineer microbes, such as yeast, and use them as catalysts to convert sugar, through fermentation, into high-value molecules. In 2015, we were awarded an investment by DARPA to expand the capabilities of our technology platform beyond terpenoids. The investment has resulted in us developing an integrated platform with artificial intelligence that will speed up the development and commercialization of small molecules across 15 different chemical classes. We have also developed our technology to be able to produce large molecules, such as proteins.
 
We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2018, our research and development organization included 199 employees, 109 of whom held Ph.D.s. We have invested more than $600 million to date in our research and development capabilities that has resulted in an almost 6x improvement in speed to market and 24x improvement in cost of manufacturing. These achievements are due to the leading strain engineering and upscaling and commercialization capabilities we have developed from our investment.
 
Strain Engineering
 
Companies and researchers around the world are continuously learning how the complex biological processes in organisms work. Because there is so much that is still unknown, the best method for development of commercially viable strains is to test as many hypotheses as accurately and quickly as possible to accelerate the learning curve.
 
We have developed a high-throughput strain engineering system that is currently capable of producing and screening more than 100,000 yeast strains per month, which enables us to achieve an approximately 90% lower cost per strain than we achieved in 2009. We generated more than 360,000 unique strains in 2018, surpassing 6.3 million unique strains created since our inception, with each strain testing for improved production of the target molecules. In addition, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict, with high reliability, the performance of candidate strains at industrial scale.
 
Upscaling and Commercialization
 
The riskiest part of commercializing biotechnology is often the scale up and manufacturing due to the perceived unpredictability of biotechnology at different scales. We have built scale-up and manufacturing capabilities as our advantage by heavily investing in prediction models and analytics to quickly ascertain how a strain’s behavior at one scale will translate in another scale. We’ve successfully scaled up and manufacture eight distinct molecules at commercial volumes to date, leading to more than 15 commercial ingredients used by thousands of leading global brands. The results of our advantage are accelerated speed to market, lower overall development costs, and a significantly lower risk profile for any project we undertake.

A strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production, and tested for performance in larger-volume facilities, before it is implemented at commercial-scale manufacturing facilities. Our unique infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes lab-scale fermenters (0.5 to 2 liter), operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil (300 liters), two 5,000-liter fermenters in our Campinas demonstration facility and five years’ experience owning and operating the 1,200,000-liter production facility in Brotas, Brazil that we sold in late 2017. Each of these stages mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot and ultimately to commercial scale. Our infrastructure is so accurate that we can go straight from lab scale to commercial scale for our fermentations. Typically, the only reason we ever invest in the pilot scale step is to produce enough product to accurately test our downstream processing since our fermentation process is already robust.
 
The complexities that can arise at industrial scale manufacturing are significant and it takes an experienced team to not only address issues as they arise, but to also have the foresight to prevent issues from arising. With five years of experience operating the production facility in Brotas, Brazil that we designed (prior to selling the facility in late 2017), we have been able to develop a world-class manufacturing team. This team has successfully brought on line a production facility and scaled up and manufactured eight molecules at commercial scale that are currently used in thousands of consumer goods products around the world. Our effort also expands into continued strain and process improvements to ensure our manufacturing is robust and the most cost advantaged.
 
Product Markets and Partnerships
 
There are three market areas that are our primary focus and key to our growth: Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty and Flavor & Fragrance. Each of these markets embodies our core competencies of sustainably providing clean ingredients in markets where we can be the most impactful, not only from a growth and revenue standpoint, but also for healthier living.
 
We believe that our leadership in biotechnology is demonstrated by collaboration partners, who come to us to access our platform and industrial fermentation expertise. Together we seek to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve profit margins. Our partners include Flavor & Fragrance companies such as Firmenich S.A. (Firmenich) and Givaudan International, SA (Givaudan), and nutraceutical companies such as DSM. A portion of our work has also been funded by the U.S. government, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and DARPA, to develop technologies and processes capable of improving the ability to utilize biotechnology for the production of a broader range of molecules.
 
Health & Wellness
 
Our Health & Wellness focus includes alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, such as vitamins, and food ingredients. As consumers continue to demand higher nutritional performance, cleaner labels and convenience from their food, the demand for specific ingredients that are often difficult and expensive to procure will continue to grow. Animal farming is also being impacted by the growing demand for protein and the need to change farming practices, such as reducing antibiotic use. Our technology can be employed to provide affordable access to these desired ingredients for both human and animal health. To date, product revenue in this area has been from a derivative made from our Biofene® product by our partner. In late 2018, we began to produce at commercial scale an alternative, non-nutritive sweetener.
 
During 2015, we announced the signings of our first ingredient supply agreement and collaboration agreement for the global nutraceuticals market. Under the supply agreement, we sourced Biofene to our partner, which was then further processed into a nutraceutical product. In 2016, we made the first large-scale shipments of Biofene to our partner, who successfully produced and sold a nutraceutical product to its customers. In 2017 and 2018, we expanded our collaborations in nutraceuticals to four vitamins and a human nutrition ingredient.

Flavor & Fragrance Markets
 
Our technology enables us to cost-effectively produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the Flavor & Fragrance market. Many of the natural ingredients used in the Flavor & Fragrance market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions. We offer Flavor & Fragrance companies a natural route to procure these high-value ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality. To date, we have successfully brought four Flavor & Fragrance ingredients to market with our collaboration partners. We also have several other ingredients under development.
 
In late 2013, we commenced commercial production of our first Flavor & Fragrance ingredient for a range of applications, from perfumes to laundry detergent, which is marketed by a collaboration partner which is a global Flavor & Fragrance leader. In 2014, we completed our first production campaign of this ingredient and shipped it to this collaboration partner. In late 2015, we commenced production and initial sales of our second Flavor & Fragrance ingredient to the same collaboration partner. During 2018, we shipped five compounds destined for the Flavor & Fragrance market (including compounds converted by our partners to Flavor & Fragrance ingredients) to our partners.
 
We are currently working to develop and commercialize a variety of Flavor & Fragrance ingredients that are either direct fermentation products or derivatives of fermentation products.
 
Clean Beauty
 
Our Clean Beauty focus includes skincare and cosmetic ingredients we develop and commercialize with our partners and our branded Biossance and Neossance product lines. We have several cosmetic ingredients currently under development. Our Biossance and Neossance products are discussed further in the Amyris-branded Product Markets section below.
 
Amyris-branded Product Markets
 
Through basic chemical finishing steps, we are able to convert our farnesene into squalane, which is used today as a premium emollient in Clean Skincare products. We believe that our squalane offers performance attributes equal or superior to those of squalane derived from conventional sources. The ingredient traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from deep-sea shark liver oil, which requires that the shark be killed in order to harvest its liver oil. The relatively high price and unstable supply of squalane in the past meant that its use was generally limited to luxury products or small quantities in mass-market product formulations. With our ability to produce a reliable supply of low-cost squalane that eliminates the need to harvest shark liver oil, we offer this ingredient at a price that we believe will drive increasing adoption by formulators. In addition to squalane, we offer a second, lower-cost emollient, hemisqualane, for the cosmetics market. In December 2016, we and Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Nikko) formed a joint venture, in which we hold a 50% interest, for our business-to-business sales of Neossance squalane and hemisqualane. See below under “Joint Venture” for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture. The joint venture currently has supply agreements with several regional distributors, including those with locations in Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and North America, and, in some cases, directly with cosmetics formulators, which we transferred to the joint venture during the formation process.
 
Our consumer skincare products, sold under our Biossance brand, feature our Biofene-derived squalane. Under our Biossance brand, we market and sell our products directly to retailers and consumers. Biossance was initially sold solely through our ecommerce branded website and in 2016, we expanded the product line to include an expansive line of high-performance skincare products and opened up sales through Home Shopping Network (HSN). In October 2016, we announced our Biossance product line would begin to be carried at Sephora in 2017. In February 2017, we launched a full squalane-based consumer cosmetic line at participating Sephora stores and Sephora online. All of the products are based on our commitment to No Compromise®. Since the launch of Biossance, sales have grown, and with Sephora’s partnership, we are looking to expand to more stores.

Manufacturing
 
Until December 2017, we owned and operated a purpose-built, large-scale production facility located in Brotas, Brazil. In December 2017, we sold the facility to a unit of DSM and entered into a supply agreement with DSM for us to purchase output from the facility. See Note 13, “Divestiture” and Note 11, "Related Party Transactions" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our December 2017 transaction with DSM.
 
In September 2019, we obtained the necessary permits and broke ground on our Specialty Ingredients Plant (SIP).  We expect the facility to be fully operational in Q1 of 2021. This facility will allow us to manufacture five products at once and to produce both our specialty ingredients portfolio and our new sweetener product. During construction, we are manufacturing our products at four contract manufacturing sites in Brazil, the U.S. and Spain. In addition, in May 2019 we entered into an agreement with Raizen Energia S.A. (Raizen) for the formation and operation of a joint venture relating to the production, sale and commercialization of alternative sweetener products whereby the parties would construct a manufacturing facility exclusively for sweetener molecules on land owned by Raizen and leased to the joint venture; see Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.
 
For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products, such as renewable squalane. We have agreements with several facilities in the U.S. and Brazil to perform these downstream steps for such products. We may enter into additional agreements with other facilities for finishing services and to access flexible production capacity and an array of other services as we develop additional products. In December 2016, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Leland, North Carolina, which had been previously operated by Glycotech Inc. (Glycotech) to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products. We subsequently contributed that facility to our Aprinnova joint venture. See below under "Joint Venture" for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture.
 
Joint Venture
 
Aprinnova, LLC
 
In December 2016, we entered into joint venture agreements with Nikko related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide commercialization of our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business. In December 2016, we formed the joint venture under the name Neossance, LLC, and later changed the name to Aprinnova, LLC (the Aprinnova JV), which is jointly owned by us and Nikko. Pursuant to the joint venture agreements, we contributed certain assets to the Aprinnova JV, including certain intellectual property and other commercial assets relating to our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business, as well as the production facility in Leland, North Carolina and related assets purchased by us from Glycotech in December 2016. We also agreed to provide the Aprinnova JV with licenses to certain intellectual property necessary to make and sell products associated with the Neossance business. At the closing of the formation of the joint venture, Nikko purchased a 50% interest in the Aprinnova JV in exchange for an initial payment to Amyris of $10.0 million and payment to Amyris of any profits distributed in cash to Nikko from the Aprinnova JV during the three year period following December 12, 2016, up to a maximum of $10.0 million. In addition, as part of the formation of the Aprinnova JV, we and Nikko agreed to make certain working capital loans to the Aprinnova JV and we further agreed to execute a supply agreement to supply farnesene to the Aprinnova JV, to purchase all of our requirements for the Aprinnova JV products from the Aprinnova JV, to transfer all of our customers for the Aprinnova JV products to the Aprinnova JV, to guarantee a maximum production cost for certain Aprinnova JV products, and to bear any cost of production above such guaranteed costs.
Product Distribution and Sales
 
We distribute and sell our products directly to distributors or collaboration partners, or through joint ventures, depending on the market. For most of our products, we sell directly to our collaboration partners, except for our consumer care products, which we sell to distributors and formulators (other than our Biossance brand, which we sell directly to retailers and consumers). Generally, our collaboration agreements include commercial terms, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO), and its foreign counterparts.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 512 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 313 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned or co-owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.
 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patents, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.”
 
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

Health & Wellness
 
Many active ingredients in the nutraceutical market are made via chemical synthesis by suppliers that have a deep chemistry knowhow and production facilities, including ingredient suppliers. We may compete directly with these companies with respect to specific ingredients or attempt to provide customers with more cost effective or higher performing alternatives. For food ingredients, we compete with companies that produce products from plant- and animal-derived sources as well as with companies that are also developing biotechnology production solutions to produce specific molecules.
Flavor & Fragrance
 
The main competition in the Flavor & Fragrance and cosmetic actives markets is from products derived from plant and animal sources as well as chemical synthesis. The products derived from plant and animal sources are typically produced at a higher cost, lower purity and create a greater impact on the environment compared to our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Clean Beauty
 
We develop and sell active cosmetic ingredients and consumer products in the Clean Beauty market, creating a competitive landscape that includes ingredient suppliers as well as consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder. Most skincare ingredients are derived from plant and animal sources or created using chemical synthesis. Plant- and animal-sourced ingredients are typically higher in cost, lower in purity and have a greater impact on the environment versus our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Competitive Factors
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our target markets are:
 
•         product price;
 •         product performance and other measures of quality;
 •         infrastructure compatibility of products;
 •         sustainability; and
 •         dependability of supply.
 
We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost, availability, performance, and consumer preference characteristics.
Regulatory Matters
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.”

GMM Regulations
 
The use of genetically-modified microorganisms (GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained commercial approvals from CTNBio to use our GMMs in a contained environment in our Brazil facilities for research and development purposes, in manufacturing and at contract manufacturing facilities in Brazil.
 
We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains, then our business will be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our use of genetically-modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products.”
 
Chemical Regulations
 
Our renewable products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a “Chemical Abstracts Service” number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, which enables us to manufacture and sell farnesane without restriction in the United States.
Other Regulations
 
Certain of our current or proposed products in the Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance markets, including alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, Flavor & Fragrance ingredients, skincare ingredients, cosmetic actives, and our proposed cannabinoid products, may be subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are manufactured, sold or proposed to be sold. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of food ingredients, vitamins, and cosmetics. Generally, in order to be marketed and sold in the United States, a relevant product must be generally recognized as safe, approved and not adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA and relevant regulations issued thereunder. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to food ingredients, vitamins and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market, and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U. S. courts. Failure to obtain requisite approval from, or comply with the laws and regulations of, the FDA or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from fully commercializing certain of our products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” Our proposed cannabinoid products may also be subject to regulation under various federal, state and foreign-controlled substance laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors - Our cannabinoid initiative is uncertain and may not yield commercial results and is subject to significant regulatory risks.”

In addition, our end-user products such as our Biossance brand skincare products are subject to the regulations of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold regarding the advertising of such products. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions, and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the FTC or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to market our end-user products.
