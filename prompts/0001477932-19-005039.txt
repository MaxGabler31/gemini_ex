ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background and Our Business

Our Vision

EVIO, Inc. aspires to support and optimize our clients’ businesses, and protect the health and safety of consumers by providing analytical testing, compliance consulting, and research & development services to the emerging legal cannabis and hemp industries.

Our founders believe that products derived from the cannabis sativa plant could have the potential to provide an alternative to pharmaceutical and nutritional products aimed at improving wellness and well-being. Our founders also believe that it is imperative that there be third party verification of the safety and quality of these products by qualified scientists in adherence with the highest accreditation standards, including ISO 17025, TNI NELAP, and GMP.

We believe that as we leverage best practices from labs across North America, we are building standardized and optimized methods and procedures that will provide EVIO a considerable advantage in a future global market for cannabis and hemp ingredients and products. 

We endeavor to ensure the EVIO brand will be synonymous with safe, high quality products. 

Our Services

EVIO, Inc’s core business is analytical testing services for cannabis and hemp growers, product formulators, processors, distributors, and retailers. We perform testing as required by state and provincial mandates, as well as for research and development or informational purposes. 

Tests include identification and quantification of compounds including cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, and terpenes. This testing includes mandated hemp field verifications, quantitation for product labeling, and testing to support product formulations. We also perform homogeneity and process control testing, and other tests to determine the quality and conformance of cannabis products.

We also identify contaminants such as solvents, pesticides, e. coli, salmonella, aflatoxins, excess moisture, and heavy metals in cannabis and related products including soils, water, hemp and CBD products.

Our labs rely on instrumentation including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (PLC) for cannabinoid testing; Triple-quadripole mass spectrometry for pesticide testing; gas chromatography for solvent and terpene testing; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICPMS) to identify heavy metal; Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology for identification of DNA or RNA from harmful microbial contaminants; and other support instruments including moisture analyzers and water activity meters, plating, and microscopy.

EVIO Biosciences and our advisory services work include providing technical guidance to our clients and governments in the areas of industry best practices, regulatory compliance, support for product formulation, assisting businesses with setting up their own internal research laboratories, providing expert advice and data to governments and financial auditors, and assisting with state and local cannabis licensing. We also leverage our expertise and access to data to perform R&D and identify new and novel testing methods and gain insights about cannabis and its potential uses.

Our Team 

Our company is led by a team of technology-focused professionals who came from Fortune-500 companies. Each of our labs is led by an experienced laboratory director who hold PhD’s or other advanced degrees in chemistry, biology, chemical engineering or other sciences. Our laboratory teams include analytical chemists and biologists and laboratory technicians who are trained to EVIO’s standardized methods and procedures to be both specialists in one area of testing and attain cross-training in other tests. 

Our teams collaborate across labs to share best practices, and we continuously improve our methods and processes across all labs based on lessons learned in each. The ability to learn from labs across the country provides a significant advantage compared to our competitors that operate one or two labs. 

Background

EVIO, INC. was originally incorporated in the State of New York, December 12, 1977 under the name 3171 Holding Corporation. On February 22, 1979 the name was changed to Electronomic Industries Corp. and on February 23, 1983 the name was changed to Quantech Electronics Corp. The Company was reincorporated in the State of Colorado on December 15, 2003. On August 29, 2014, Signal Bay Research, Inc., a Nevada corporation completed a reverse merger with Quantech Electronics Corp., a public shell company. In September 2014, the Company changed its name to Signal Bay, Inc. (now named EVIO). The Company has selected September 30 as its fiscal year end. The Company is domiciled in the State of Colorado, and its corporate headquarters is located in Henderson, NV.

During 2014 and 2015, Signal Bay’s primary business focus was providing consulting services, market research, and data analysis for businesses, governments, and individuals, involved with the emerging legal cannabis industry. In 2015, the founders identified the testing market as an underserved segment of the emerging cannabis industry that provided a service that was in alignment with our vision to contribute to the development of a safe and compliant industry. 

In September 2015, the Company acquired a majority stake of an analytical testing laboratory in Bend, OR. The Company continued to acquire laboratories with the goal of attaining best practices and capturing market share in advance of the adult-use legalization of cannabis in Oregon. By 2017, the Company had acquired 4 testing labs in Oregon and gained licensing and accreditation for all four labs to perform testing to the newly adopted rigorous testing standards required by the State of Oregon. The labs began operating under one name, EVIO Labs. The company continued its growth in other states, through both acquisitions and licensing agreements. 

In August 2017, Signal Bay, Inc. changed its name to EVIO, Inc. 

In January 2018, the Company acquired C3 Labs, LLC, a cannabis research and development laboratory in Berkeley California. During 2018, we expanded the scope of lab services to include compliance testing, in anticipation of newly adopted rules to serve California’s mandated testing requirements. 

In May 2018, the Company formed EVIO Canada, Inc. and acquired a 50% state in Keystone Labs, Inc. located in Edmonton, Alberta. Keystone provides a full array of analytical and microbiological testing services for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, nutraceutical, and medical cannabis industries.

In September 2018, the company operated or licensed labs in 6 states and Alberta, Canada.

Specialized Skill and Knowledge

Our testing labs require the specialized expertise of qualified chemists and micro-biologists at each lab location. All of the Company’s laboratory technicians have undergraduate degrees in science; laboratory analysts have masters’ degrees or equivalent experience; and laboratory directors have post-graduate degrees or prior laboratory experience plus management expertise. Laboratory staff have both scientific knowledge and specialized expertise in performing analytical testing, and specifically testing cannabis and cannabis products. The labs also require specialized personnel in the areas of compliance and quality assurance.
Competitive Conditions

Due to prohibitions on interstate transport of cannabis in the US, cannabis labs compete on a state by state level. In Oregon, there are approximately 20 accredited cannabis test labs, of which we owned four, and consolidated to two. Competitors in Oregon include GreenLeaf Labs, ChemHistory, Juniper Labs, and Pixis Labs. None of the Company’s competitors in Oregon have labs at multiple locations.

In Massachusetts, there are four labs, of which the Company owns one. Competing labs in Massachusetts include MCR Labs and Pro Verde.

In Canada, the Company competes with 33 “licensed dealers” nationwide.

California currently has 25 licensed cannabis laboratories. Current incumbent competitors include: Steep Hill, SC Labs, PharmLabs and CW Analytical. Steep Hill is currently expanding globally through licensing agreements.

In Colorado, there are approximately 15 labs, four of which are key competitors.

Our licensed labs in Florida are the first in the state and face no substantial competition, at this time.

DigiPath in Nevada is the only other publicly traded lab and operates in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we do not compete. DigiPath has stated plans to expand into Northern California.

Our Growth Strategy

Focus on the newly legalized markets in California and Massachusetts. California is projected to be the largest cannabis market in the world. In 2018, California implemented new testing requirements that require all cannabis sold in the recently regulated adult-use dispensaries be tested. This opens a substantial opportunity for EVIO to capture substantial market share of the California market. Massachusetts is also a recent addition to the roster of adult-use states and has created an immediate opportunity to perform testing, especially because of the small number of labs in the state.

Rapidly expand our brand throughout North America and abroad through license agreements. As we have established the EVIO brand and refined our methods and processes, we have an opportunity to aggressively grow our brand by engaging in technology and brand licensing agreements. Such agreements allow us to launch new labs very quickly with the support of strategic partners around the world who wish to open a cannabis testing lab, but need help getting started. Engaging in license agreements allows us to establish a brand presence with reduced operational risk. 

Engage in the newly regulated Hemp and CBD markets. With the emergence of CBD products, and a market that is expected to eclipse the cannabis market, we anticipated that the states, and the FDA will require that hemp-derived CBD products undergo testing. EVIO will be well positioned to perform this testing, both now, and after the new expected regulations come out. 


Evaluate new domestic and international markets for growth. The cannabis market continues to grow as more US states and many countries implement medical and adult use cannabis programs. EVIO will continue to evaluate new markets.


Establish partnerships with the industry’s leading national brands and organizations. We believe that consolidation within the industry is likely. Therefore, we will focus our efforts on establishing partnerships with the companies and brands that are most likely to emerge as leaders. EVIO’s national footprint should attract the multi-state and multi-national operators that seek consistent testing and a consistent customer experience at any lab they work with.
