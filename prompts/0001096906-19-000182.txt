Item 1. Business.Our Company

Astika Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us” or “registrant”) is refocusing and preparing to relaunch the Company through one or more strategic acquisitions in the textile, service, agricultural and industrial sectors in Asia and New Zealand.  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on January 13, 2011.  On September 26, 2014, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Astika Music Entertainment, Inc.  The dissolution was in response to the change in the nature of business operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $0 revenues and had a net loss of $55,450.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at Level 1, 725 Rosebank Road, Avondale, Auckland, 1348, New Zealand. Our telephone number is (64) 9 929 0502. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
 
Current Operations
 
We ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue on September 26, 2014. Significant costs after we ceased operations consisted primarily of audit and legal costs. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we did not conduct business operations except to evaluate potential lines of business. 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2018 had a shareholders’ deficit of $124,650. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity. The Company cannot be certain that this strategy will be successful.
 
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Research and Development 
We have not incurred any research and development costs in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.

As of May 8, 2019, we employed two persons on a part-time basis. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
