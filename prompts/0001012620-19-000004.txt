ITEM 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
We own or lease 120 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in nine operating regions with approximately 8,000 employees and 3,000 customers. 

• | Our seven North American regions serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces and include 114 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.


• | Our Australian Region serves New South Wales, the Northern Territory and South Australia and operates the 1,400-mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line. The Australia Region is 51.1% owned by G&W and 48.9% owned by a consortium of funds and clients managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).


• | Our U.K./European Region includes the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and the second-largest freight rail provider, as well as regional rail services in Continental Europe.

Our subsidiaries and joint ventures also provide rail service at more than 40 major ports, rail-ferry service between the United States Southeast and Mexico, transload services, contract coal loading, and industrial railcar switching and repair.
GROWTH STRATEGY
Since our initial public offering in 1996, our revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16.8%, from $77.8 million in 1996 to $2.3 billion in 2018. Over the same period, our stock price has increased at a compound growth rate of 14.2%, from $3.75 on June 25, 1996, adjusted for stock splits, to $74.02 on December 31, 2018. We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy; and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
Operating Strategy
Our railroads operate under strong regional management teams, supported by centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight. As of December 31, 2018, our operations were organized in nine geographic regions. In North America, we have seven regions: Central (which includes industrial switching operations), Coastal (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Midwest, Northeast, Southern, Western and Canada. Outside North America, we have two regions: Australia (which is 51.1% owned by us through the Australia partnership with MIRA) and U.K./Europe (which consists of operations in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, as well as the provision of management and technical support through Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner) to Saudi Railway Company).

In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals. Our regional managers focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy. At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following five principal elements:

• | Continuous Safety Improvement. We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business and that the attention to detail necessary to eliminate employee injuries translates into efficient, well-run operations. Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program. To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the United States Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to all of our operations worldwide. In 2018, our operations achieved a consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate of 0.84 per 200,000 man-hours worked. Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 57% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked. For comparative purposes, from January 2018 through November 2018, the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 2.64 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 2.93 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked. Based on these results, in 2018, our operations were more than three times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages. Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA. Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.68 and 0.58 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.


• | Outstanding Customer Service. We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers, and each of our local railroads is focused on exceeding customer expectations. This customer commitment supports not only traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities. To ensure the needs of our customers are addressed promptly, we employ technology-based service exception tools to monitor service information, communicate issues and track corrective actions. We engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a biennial, comprehensive customer satisfaction survey. The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs. Over the past ten years, we have outscored the trucking and railroad industries on each of our biennial customer satisfaction surveys.


• | Focused Regional Marketing. We generally build and operate each of our regions based on the local customer base within our operating geographies and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers. As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012, Freightliner in 2015, Glencore Rail (NSW) Pty Limited (GRail) in 2016 and Pentalver Transport Limited (Pentalver) in 2017, we believe that our expanded footprint across North America, Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe provides us with greater visibility of new commercial and industrial development opportunities in these geographies that should continue to enhance the success of our marketing efforts. Further, we believe that our relationship with MIRA, a recognized Australian infrastructure investor, will enable us to leverage our rail platform for future growth opportunities in Australia. We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, rolling-stock and shipping container repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enables our customers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.


• | Low Cost Structure. We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition. We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead by leveraging our regional structure, consolidating equipment and in-sourcing track maintenance, reducing transportation costs, selling surplus assets and reducing expenses associated with accidents and personal injuries through the implementation of our safety culture. In addition, through our Roots Reset program, which is an internal framework focused on improving the operating efficiency of our railroads, we periodically review and benchmark our railroad operations and service plans. The purpose of the program is to identify revenue opportunities, to reduce costs and to optimize asset utilization.

5


• | Efficient Use of Capital. We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers. At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs. For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density. Further, in 2015, we formed a new entity, Railroad Engineering Services LLC, with experienced management and dedicated track engineering resources to enhance the productivity of our track and bridge capital programs. In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track and other infrastructure. Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.

To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from scale efficiencies and centralized expertise. Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I railroad relationship management. Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture, conducting training programs, leveraging our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise. In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
Acquisition and Investment Strategy
Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers. Since 2000, we have added 105 railroads through the execution of our acquisition and investment strategy. Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:

• | Acquisitions of short line and regional railroads in the United States and Canada, such as the Heart of Georgia Railroad, Inc. (HOG) in 2017 and the Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (Providence and Worcester Railroad) in 2016 and our acquisitions of Pinsly Railroad Company's (Pinsly) Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) in 2015, RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005. Based on Association of American Railroads (AAR) data issued in 2018, there were approximately 500 short line and regional railroads in the United States not owned by us;


• | Acquisitions of international railroads and transportation service providers, such as our acquisitions of Pentalver in the U.K. in 2017, London-based Freightliner in 2015, FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008. We believe that there are additional acquisition and investment prospects in Australia, Europe and other international markets, including significant opportunities to invest in ancillary businesses that expand our service offerings;


• | Investments in track and/or rolling stock to support growth in new or existing areas of operations, such as recent purchases of rolling stock in Australia to support the increase in spot coal traffic and our September 2017 joint venture with SEACOR Holdings, Inc. to own and operate the CG Railway, LLC (CGR). CGR provides a freight rail ferry service that extends our reach from Mobile, Alabama to southeastern Mexico;


• | Acquisitions or long-term leases of branch lines of Class I railroads, such as our acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation (DM&E) from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP) in 2014; and


• | Acquisitions of operations from industrial or mining companies, such as our acquisitions of GRail from Glencore Coal Pty Limited in Australia on December 1, 2016 and the railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.

6

When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives. In some cases, however, the best way to maximize the value of an investment is to increase expenditures at a new acquisition, such as for track upgrades or equipment for new service, which improves customer satisfaction and drives additional revenue growth. 
In North America, we believe that our footprint of railroads provides opportunities to make contiguous short line railroad acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads. On a global basis, we believe that our scale, international experience and financial resources enhance our ability to compete for rail and ancillary business opportunities worldwide. We have made a number of important railroad investments in North America and in various international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
INDUSTRY
North American Operations
United States
According to the AAR's 2018 Railroad Facts Book, there were 613 freight railroads in the United States operating over approximately 137,000 miles of track. As described in the table below, the AAR classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation) and track miles operated.
The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:

Classification of Railroads | Number | AggregateMilesOperated | | Revenues and Miles Operated
Class I(a) | 7 | | 93,058 | | $463.86 million or more 
Regional or Class II | 22 | | 11,035 | | At least $20 million and 350 or more miles operated; or $37.11 million to $463.86 million
Local or Class III | 584 | | 32,758 | | Less than $37.11 million and less than 350 miles operated

Class I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density and intercity traffic lanes. The primary function of the regional and local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I railroad networks. Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers. We refer to local railroads as short line railroads. Typically, local, or short line, railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads. Short line railroads generally have more predictable and straightforward operations as they largely perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the Class I railroads or larger regional railroads.
A significant portion of regional and short line railroad traffic is driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers. For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
7

The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads. Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks. In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold or leased branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines. Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
We operate two regional and 104 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 15,800 miles of track, inclusive of approximately 3,200 miles of track that are owned or leased by others, which we operate through various trackage and operating rights agreements.
Canada
According to Rail Trends 2018, published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are approximately 26,400 miles (42,500 kilometers (km)) of track operated by railroads in Canada. Similar to the United States railroad industry, freight railroads in Canada are also categorized as Class I railroads, regional railroads and short line railroads. In Canada, there are two Class I railroads that are largely transcontinental carriers in Canada, with significant United States operations as well, several regional operators and approximately 50 short line railroads.
We operate eight local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,318 miles of track, inclusive of approximately 100 miles of track that are owned or leased by others, which we operate through various trackage and operating rights agreements.
Australian Operations
Australia has approximately 25,000 miles (40,000 km) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers and also connect key mining regions to ports. The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, narrow and standard gauge. There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia). In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.
The Australian rail freight transport industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime. The access rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government. The Australian rail freight transport industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail). This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track that they own or lease. We are an accredited rolling-stock operator in all mainland Australian states and a Rail infrastructure Manager in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
Since Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks. The open access nature of the Australian rail freight transport industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business. However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.

Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,300 miles (3,700 km) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles (2,200 km) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054, as well as approximately 900 miles (1,500 km) of track in South Australia that we manage pursuant to a lease that expires in 2047. Through the concession and lease agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage. In South Australia and the Northern Territory, our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad despite the open access environment. In addition, through our acquisitions of Freightliner and GRail, we also have above rail operations in New South Wales.
U.K./European Operations
United Kingdom
According to Network Rail, the authority responsible for Great Britain’s railway network, there are approximately 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of track owned and managed by it, and there are seven rail operators licensed for freight transport in Great Britain. Great Britain’s rail network is also open access, which means rail lines can be utilized by any licensed rail operator with an appropriate track access agreement in place. In the U.K.'s open access framework, the infrastructure managers must provide access to the rail infrastructure to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and framework of each applicable access regime. As a result, U.K. rail freight customers have access to multiple rail carriers under the open access regime, and our operations face competition from both other rail freight carriers and other modes of transportation, such as road and water. In Great Britain, in 2017, 9% of all freight goods were moved by rail, while over the same period, 78% and 13% of goods were moved via road and water, respectively.
Through the acquisition of Pentalver, we operate off-dock container terminals (most under long-term lease) strategically placed at each of the three major seaports of Felixstowe, Southampton and London Gateway, as well as an inland terminal located at Cannock, in the U.K. Midlands, near many of the nation’s largest distribution centers. In addition to providing storage for loaded and empty containers on over 100 acres of land, Pentalver also operates a trucking haulage service with more than 150 trucks, primarily providing daily service between the seaports of Felixstowe and Southampton and its inland terminal at Cannock. Pentalver also provides services related to container maintenance, repair and conversions (including refrigerated containers) and is one of the largest sellers of new and used containers in the U.K. 
The maritime container logistics industry in the U.K. is highly competitive, whether by road, rail or short-sea, with a premium placed on timely, efficient and safe service. We provide rail and road transportation solutions, as well as offer storage options at the ports and inland and provide local collection and delivery haulage from Freightliner’s inland terminals. 
Freightliner is the largest rail participant in the U.K. intermodal market (deep sea maritime containers), and when combined with Freightliner's bulk haulage operations, including coal, aggregates, cement and infrastructure services, Freightliner is the second largest rail freight company in the U.K.
Belgium
According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,238 miles (3,602 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Belgian rail network, and currently there are 12 rail operators licensed for freight transport in Belgium. As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country. Our subsidiary, Belgium Rail Feeding, has the ability to operate in Belgium, but is currently not doing business.
Germany
The German rail network is composed of approximately 20,654 miles (33,241 km) of track. There are approximately 385 rail operators certified for freight transport in Germany. In Germany, as well as in other Continental European markets, the leading rail freight operators are often state controlled, such as DB Cargo AG in Germany. As a result of Germany's open access regime, the rail infrastructure may be accessed by any licensed rail operator. 
9

A number of our subsidiaries operate in Germany. Freightliner PL Sp. zo. o. (Freightliner Poland) operates on the open access rail system within Poland with cross-border traffic into Germany. Freightliner DE GmbH (Freightliner Germany) operates on the open access rail system within Germany with cross-border traffic into Poland.
Netherlands
According to ProRail, the entity responsible for the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,363 miles (7,021 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Dutch rail network. As a result of the open access regime in the Netherlands, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator. According to ProRail, there are 21 rail operators that provide rail freight services in the Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, our subsidiary, RRF, operates mainly in the Port of Rotterdam on the main rail freight corridors towards the German and Belgian borders. 
Poland
According to the Office of Rail Transport, the railway regulator in Poland, there are approximately 114 rail operators certified for freight transport in Poland operating over approximately 11,939 miles (19,214 km) of track. As a result of Poland’s open access regime, this rail infrastructure may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator. 
In Poland, our subsidiary, Freightliner Poland, operates on the open access network within Poland.
OPERATIONS
Through our subsidiaries, we own or lease 120 freight railroads worldwide, including 104 short line railroads and two regional freight railroads in the United States, eight short line railroads in Canada, three railroads in Australia, one in the U.K., one in Poland and Germany and one in the Netherlands. Our subsidiaries provide freight rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers. 
Our railroads operate over approximately 16,100 miles of track that are owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line in Australia that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054. Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 6,200 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
While our railroads are predominantly focused on freight service, certain of our railroads interact with passenger rail operations. The majority of our railroads in the U.K. and Continental Europe provide freight service that is commingled with passenger operations on third party track. In North America and Australia, it is not uncommon for passenger or excursion operators to provide service over our track. In addition, in the United States, the Providence and Worcester Railroad provides freight service over track that is owned by a passenger operator, and our Portland & Western Railroad operates passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon.
Freight Revenues
We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail. Freight revenues represented approximately 70%, 70% and 69% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities. For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see the discussion under "Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

We group the commodities we carry as follows:

Commodity Group | Commodity Description 
Agricultural Products | Wheat, barley, corn and other grains, as well as soybean meal 
Autos & Auto Parts | Finished automobiles and stamped auto parts 
Chemicals & Plastics | Sulfuric acid, ethanol, fertilizers and other chemicals and plastics used in manufacturing 
Coal & Coke | Shipments of coal to power plants and industrial customers 
Food & Kindred Products | Fruits, vegetables and food oils 
Intermodal | Various commodities shipped in trailers or containers on flat cars 
Lumber & Forest Products | Finished lumber, wood pellets, export logs and wood chips 
Metallic Ores | Manganese ore, iron ore, copper concentrate and ore and alumina 
Metals | Finished steel products and copper, as well as scrap metal and pig iron 
Minerals & Stone | Construction aggregates, clay and bentonite, gypsum, salt used in highway ice control, limestone and frac sand
Petroleum Products | Liquefied petroleum gases, natural gas liquids, crude oil, asphalt, diesel fuel and gasoline 
Pulp & Paper | Container board, finished papers, scrap paper and wood pulp 
Waste | Municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris 
Other | Freight not included in the commodity groups set forth above 

Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic. Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers. It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic). Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers. Unlike overhead traffic, which has the potential to move from origin to destination without using our rail line, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation. In 2018, revenues generated from originating, terminating and local traffic in North America constituted approximately 93% of our North American freight revenues. In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, railroads generally serve from origin to destination with few, if any, interline movements. 
Freight-Related Revenues
We generate freight-related revenues primarily from port terminal railroad operations and industrial switching services (where we operate trains on a contract basis in facilities we do not own), trucking haulage services and container storage, as well as demurrage, storage, car hire, track access rights, transloading, crewing services, traction service (or hook and pull service that requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customer's train between specified origin and destination points) and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight. Freight-related revenues represented approximately 24%, 24% and 27% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
All Other Revenues
We generate all other revenues primarily from revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, container sales, property rentals and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight. All other revenues represented approximately 6%, 6% and 5% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
11

Seasonality of Operations
Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle. Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations due to weather patterns. See Note 19, Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited), to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report. Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products, such as construction materials. Further, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs. In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season (i.e., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory). In the U.K./European operations, the intermodal business peaks in the late third and early fourth quarter of the year. We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable. 
Segment and Geographic Information
For financial information with respect to each of our segments and geographic areas, see Note 18, Segment and Geographic Area Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report. For information about the risks related to our foreign operations, see "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" and more specifically "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors—Additional Risks Associated With Our Foreign Operations."
Customers
As of December 31, 2018, our operations served approximately 3,000 customers. Revenues from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26%, 24% and 22% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Two of our ten largest customers in 2018 were located in Australia. One operates in the agricultural and coal sectors, and the other operates in the iron ore mining sector. Three of our ten largest customers in 2018 were located in the U.K. Two of these customers are maritime shipping companies and the other is the infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales. The remaining five of our top ten customers are located in North America, and each of such customers represents less than 2% of our total operating revenues. 
In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer. These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to ten years. These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume. Generally, our freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped. 
In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers. These contracts have terms as long as 20 years and generally contain a combination of volume commitments and fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion based upon the invested capital associated with the contract and the variable portion based on the actual volumes shipped. 
In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us and the customer. These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration from one to twelve years in the U.K. and one to two years in Poland. These contracts establish a price or a methodology to calculate the price. In some cases, the contracts provide for a minimum volume commitment by the customer and certain business is also conducted on a spot basis. Our contracts will typically provide for a price adjustment to reflect any changes to particular elements of our cost base, such as fuel and track access charges. In addition, Freightliner, as part of a British consortium, provides management and technical support for infrastructure and freight operations to Saudi Railway Company. The Saudi Railway Company is a government-owned company that is tasked with developing and operating railway services in Saudi Arabia. 
12

Employees
There are various labor laws governing the countries in which we operate. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,000 full-time employees. Of this total, approximately 4,200 employees were union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council. Our operations have 101 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and U.K./Europe. We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to approximately 27 of those agreements and are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with four newly represented bargaining units, which will cover approximately 73 additional employees. We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 19 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization. In the United States, we have 70 labor agreements with unions which cover approximately 36% of our employees within the United States. In Canada, we have 11 labor agreements, which cover approximately 53% of our employees within Canada. In Australia, Genesee & Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) has collective enterprise bargaining agreements covering the majority of its employees. In the U.K., we have collective bargaining agreements with four recognized unions covering the majority of our employees. In Continental Europe, key locations have local work councils. We continue to build and maintain positive working relationships with our employees and their representatives.
The following table sets forth an approximation of union and non-union employees as of December 31, 2018:

 | Union/Represented (a) | Non-Union/Non-Represented
North America | 1,700 | | 2,700
Australia | 500 | | 200 
U.K./Europe | 2,000 | | 900 
Total | 4,200 | | 3,800


(a) | Also includes employees that have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.

SAFETY
Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of train accidents and personal injuries. Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules, and governmental rules and regulations. In order to continuously improve our safety results, we utilize and measure various safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries. To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the FRA to all of our operations worldwide. Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.84 and 0.83 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads was 2.64 in 2018 (through November) and 2.49 in 2017. Based on these results, in 2018, our operations were more than three times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages. 
 Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA. Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.68 and 0.58 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Further, we continue to utilize technology to analyze and maintain our track so as to prevent track-caused derailments. 
In addition, our information technology staff routinely assesses the security of our computer networks from cyber attacks. While we have not experienced any material disruptions of our networks or operations due to cyber attacks, to date, we have been subject to attacks in the past and will continue to face such threats in the future.
13

Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, such as Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings. During 2018, employees of our railroads made 412 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property. We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
INSURANCE
We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services. Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and accidents involving passengers and other third-party claims associated with our operations. Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies. Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence. Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control. Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $2.5 million per occurrence. The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events. The self-insured retentions under our insurance policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our Company and general insurance market conditions.
We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, as well as insurance for employment practices, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation, pollution, cyber risk, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others. 
COMPETITION
Railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes and for certain commodities, ships, barges and pipelines. Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
In North America, there normally is only one rail carrier directly serving a customer facility, while most freight is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination. To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes, so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation. In addition, we also face competition from other companies that provide terminal and rail-related services.
To a lesser degree, there is also competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition. For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations. In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation). We also face import competition, where commodities we transport face competition from less expensive imported products (e.g., steel). In addition, some of the products we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis (e.g., grain).
14

In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators. Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller's assessment of the buyer's railroad operating expertise and financing capability. We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, position us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
REGULATION
North American Operations
United States
In addition to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:

• | United States Surface Transportation Board (STB);


• | FRA;


• | federal agencies, including the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS);


• | state departments of transportation; and


• | some state and local regulatory agencies.

The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees. The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which include the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications. The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and may regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
Over the past five years, there have been various proceedings at the STB seeking to expand rail regulation. The STB continues to evaluate the impact of "access" regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure and has held hearings to assess the impact of changes to the access regime in the United States. The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
In 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which, following the passage by Congress of an extension in October 2015, generally was to be completed as early as December 31, 2018, unless extensions were granted. PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident. The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives. Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads were required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018. Our procurement and implementation of required PTC equipment is underway, and thus far, we have complied and expect to continue to comply with the statutory installation deadlines. However, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. 
15

Canada
Railroads that operate in more than one province are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules and the jurisdiction of the federal government. St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), Ottawa Valley Railway, Southern Ontario Railway, Knob Lake & Timmins Railway and the Goderich-Exeter Railway are federally regulated railroads in Canada that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act. The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines. TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
Railways operating exclusively within one province are regulated by that province and must hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by the appropriate provincial authority. Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton & Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively. In addition, Huron Central Railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario. Generally, construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated by the provincial authorities, as are railway services.
Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian. In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada's Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
Australian Operations
In Australia, we are subject to multiple regulatory regimes governing workplace health and safety, as well as rail safety, in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate. Regulation of rail safety is predominately governed by national legislation and administered by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator.
Regulation of track access to nationally significant rail infrastructure is generally governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states. The state access regimes are required to be certified as effective access regimes by the Australian National Competition Council. The regulatory oversight for the provision of rail infrastructure access in South Australia and the Northern Territory is largely provided by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia. In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board based on Australian national interest considerations and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on competition considerations.
U.K./European Operations
In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail. These directives generally cover the development of railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings. The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety. Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network, and EU member states must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies. These directives have been or will be implemented in legislation passed in each of the European countries in which we operate.
16

Currently, each of the countries in which our U.K./European Operations segment operates is a member of the EU, and each one has adopted a similar regulatory regime consistent with European legislation. EU law requires each member state to establish an overarching regulatory body for rail, independent in its organization, legal structure, funding and decision making that is also independent from any infrastructure manager. The regulatory body ensures fair and non-discriminatory access to the rail infrastructure network and will often be responsible for monitoring competition in the rail services market, the licensing of rail operators and rail safety. In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently, and any other bilateral trade agreements the U.K. can reach with other trade partners, as well as any changes to the regulation of rail.
The rail infrastructure is owned and managed by the infrastructure manager who is responsible for maintaining and renewing the infrastructure as well as enhancements to the rail network. Access to the network is granted by the infrastructure manager through track access arrangements with licensed rail operators, with oversight by the regulatory body in certain EU countries. Currently, all of the infrastructure managers in the European countries in which we operate are owned or controlled by the respective governments in each country. The governments of each member state have ministries or departments dedicated to transport who are responsible for the long-term strategy, planning and funding of the transport infrastructure, including rail. These departments are also responsible for implementing European directives into domestic legislation. 

Country | Regulatory Body | Infrastructure Manager | Government Ministry | Competition Regulator(s) 
Germany | Bundesnetzagentur | DB Netz AG | Federal Ministry of Transport Building and Urban Development | The enforcement of German competition law primarily lies with the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) and in certain circumstances with the respective state competition authorities (Landeskartellbehörden)
The Netherlands | The Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate | ProRail | The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management | The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets 
Poland | Office of Rail and Transport | PKP PLK S.A. | Ministry of Infrastructure | Office of Rail TransportThe President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection 
United Kingdom | Office of Rail and Road | Network Rail | Department for Transport Transport Scotland | Office of Rail and Road 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations, which frequently involve transporting hazardous materials. We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers. We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements in all material respects. While we presently estimate that any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
17

North American Operations
In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are administered and implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances. The primary laws affecting our operations are: the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
As a result of our operations, we receive notices from time to time from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States. In November 2014, we received a notice from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama. Although the cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete, civil payment penalty associated with the contamination is subject to further discussion and potential litigation.
In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level. 
Australia Operations
In Australia, environmental laws and regulations are administered primarily by the Department of Environment at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state and territories level.
Our railroads in Australia are subject to environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements, of which we have two in Australia, one with the South Australian Environmental Protection Agency under EPA License 2933 and the other with the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency under EPL 222. Genesee & Wyoming Australia is not currently required to be licensed in New South Wales but may be required to be licensed in the future. Our South Australia and Northern Territory environmental protection licenses require us to provide annual returns demonstrating compliance with their operational and administrative conditions. They also have embedded in them conditions that require us to make certain notifications in the event of an occurrence that is likely to breach a condition of the licenses or the legislation. These conditions have been managed effectively to date. Genesee & Wyoming Australia is also obligated to report annually under the Commonwealth Government National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act. Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the implementation of remedial actions, the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our lease. 
U.K./European Operations
In the U.K., European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Environment Agency, along with local authorities and other related bodies. Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and the Department for Transport (DfT).
There is no principal environmental regulator in Germany. State authorities (usually district or county authorities), guided by their respective State Environmental Ministry, carry out day-to-day operational activities. Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the Federal Railway Office.
In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. 
The principal body responsible for environmental policy and law in Poland is the Ministry of the Environmental Protection, while the principal enforcement authority is the regional inspector for environmental protection. Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the President of the Rail Transport Office.
