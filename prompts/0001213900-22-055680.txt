ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



Smart Powerr Corp. is a holding company incorporated in the state of Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our subsidiaries established in the PRC.



We are a pioneer in waste energy recycling and a developer of energy efficiency solutions for various energy intensive industries in China. We use Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) model to provide energy saving and recovery facilities for multiple energy intensive industries in China. Our waste energy recycling projects allow customers which use substantial amounts of electricity to recapture previously wasted pressure, heat, and gas from their manufacturing processes to generate electricity. We currently offer waste energy recycling systems to companies for use in nonferrous metal plants. We construct our projects at our customer’s facility and the electricity produced is used on-site by the customer.



We develop fully customized projects across several verticals to better meet customer’s energy recovery needs. We provide a clean-technology and energy-efficient solution aimed at reducing the air pollution and energy shortage problems in China. Our projects capture industrial waste energy to produce low-cost electricity, enabling industrial manufacturers to reduce their energy costs by 5% to 20%, lower their operating costs, and in optimal circumstances, extend the life of primary manufacturing equipment, while still complying with government regulations on emissions. Specifically, our power generation systems use the waste heat and pressure of flue gas generated during customers’ daily course of energy usage, such as manufacturing, and carry out necessary dust removal and desulfurization process afterwards, before putting the renewed energy back into use. The purified flue gas can reduce the wear and corrosion of pipes, valves and fans on the original production line, so as to improve the service life of these equipment. In addition, our waste energy recycling projects allow our industrial customers to reduce their reliance on China’s centralized national power grid, which is prone to black-outs or brown-outs or is completely inaccessible from certain remote areas. Our projects generally produce lower carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants, and are designed to be more environmentally friendly than other forms of power generation.



Since 2007, we have primarily used the BOT model to serve our customers. For each project, we design, finance, construct and install the waste energy recycling projects for our customers, operate the projects for five to 20 years, and then transfer the projects to the owners. The BOT model creates a win-win solution for both our customers and us. We provide the capital expenditure financing in exchange for attractive returns on each project; our customers can focus their capital resources on their core businesses, do not need to invest additional capitals to comply with government environmental regulations, reduce noise and emissions and reduce their energy costs. We in turn recapture our costs through the stream of lease payments.



We are headquartered in China. Our principal executive offices are located at 4/F, Tower C, Rong Cheng Yun Gu Building, Keji 3rd Road, Yanta District, Xi’an City, Shaanxi Province, China, and our telephone number at this location is +86-29-8765-1098.

Company Overview and History



The Company was incorporated on May 8, 1980 as Boulder Brewing Company under the laws of the State of Colorado. On September 6, 2001, the Company changed its state of incorporation to the State of Nevada. In 2004, the Company changed its name from Boulder Brewing Company to China Digital Wireless, Inc. and on March 8, 2007, again changed its name from China Digital Wireless, Inc. to China Recycling Energy Corporation, and most recently to Smart Powerr Corp. in March of 2022. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides energy saving solutions and services, including selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers, project investment, investment management, economic information consulting, technical services, financial leasing, purchase of financial leasing assets, disposal and repair of financial leasing assets, consulting and ensuring of financial leasing transactions in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”).



Our business is primarily conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Yinghua and Sifeng, Sifeng’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Huahong and Shanghai TCH, Shanghai TCH’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Xi’an TCH, Xi’an TCH’s wholly-owned subsidiary Erdos TCH and Xi’an TCH’s 90% owned and Shanghai TCH’s 10% owned subsidiary Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and Zhongxun. Shanghai TCH was established as a foreign investment enterprise in Shanghai under the laws of the PRC on May 25, 2004, and currently has registered capital of $29.80 million. Xi’an TCH was incorporated in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province under the laws of the PRC in November 2007. Erdos TCH was incorporated in April 2009. Huahong was incorporated in February 2009. Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. was incorporated in July 2013. Xi’an TCH owns 90% and Shanghai TCH owns 10% of Zhonghong. Zhonghong provides energy saving solutions and services, including constructing, selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers. Zhongxun was incorporated in March 2014 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xi’an TCH.



The Company is still in the process of transforming and expanding into an energy storage integrated solution provider. We plan to pursue disciplined and targeted expansion strategies for market areas we currently do not serve. We actively seek and explore opportunities to apply energy storage technologies to new industries or segments with high growth potential, including industrial and commercial complexes, large scale photovoltaic (PV) and wind power stations, remote islands without electricity, and smart energy cities with multi-energy supplies.



Legal and Operational Risks of Operating in the PRC



Smart Powerr Corp., or the Company or CREG, is a holding company incorporated in the state of Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations, CREG conducts a substantial majority of its operations through its subsidiaries established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC or China. However, neither the holding company nor any of the Company’s Chinese subsidiaries conduct any operations through contractual arrangements with a variable interest entity based in China. Investors in our common stock should be aware that they may never directly hold equity interests in the PRC operating entities, but rather purchasing equity solely in CREG, our Nevada holding company. Furthermore, shareholders may face difficulties enforcing their legal rights under United States securities laws against our directors and officers who are located outside of the United States. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China – Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us” on page 38 of this annual report.



Our equity structure is a direct holding structure. Within our direct holding structure, the cross-border transfer of funds within our corporate entities is legal and compliant with the laws and regulations of the PRC. After the foreign investors’ funds enter CREG, the funds can be directly transferred to the PRC operating companies through its subsidiaries. Specifically, CREG is permitted under the Nevada laws to provide funding to our subsidiary in Cayman Islands through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. Our subsidiary in Cayman Islands is also permitted under the laws of Cayman Islands to provide funding to CREG through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. As of the date hereof, there have not been any transfers, dividends or distributions made between the holding company, its subsidiaries, and to investors. Furthermore, as of the date hereof, no cash generated from one subsidiary is used to fund another subsidiary’s operations and we do not anticipate any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries. We have also not installed any cash management policies that dictate the amount of such funds and how such funds are transferred. For the foreseeable future, we intend to use the earnings for our business operations and as a result, we do not intend to distribute earnings or pay any cash dividends. See “Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries” on page 4 and 54 of this annual report.

Because our operations are primarily located in the PRC through our subsidiaries, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations in China, including changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government, the relations between China and the United States, or Chinese or United States regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock, or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.  We do not believe that our subsidiaries are directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements, as we have not implemented any monopolistic behavior and our business does not involve the collection of user data or implicate cybersecurity. As of the date hereof, no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly require us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, or any other PRC governmental authorities for future offerings, nor has our Nevada holding company or any of our subsidiaries received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding previous offerings from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is not highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or the SCNPC, or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing rules that requires our company or any of our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before future offerings in the U.S. In other words, although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly; our ability to offer, or continue to offer, securities to investors would be potentially hindered and the value of our securities might significantly decline or be worthless, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental authorities, if we or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption by PRC governmental with little advance notice.

These developments could add uncertainties to the trading of our common stock (see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China – The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors which are not inspected by the PCAOB.

Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries



Smart Powerr Corp. is a holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiaries in China. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our subsidiaries in China to fund our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. If our subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.



Our equity structure is a direct holding company structure. Within our direct holding company structure, the cross-border transfer of funds between our corporate entities is legal and compliant with the laws and regulations of the PRC. After the foreign investors’ funds enter CREG, the funds can be directly transferred to the PRC operating companies through its subsidiaries. Specifically, Smart Powerr Corp. is permitted under the Nevada laws to provide funding to our subsidiary, Sifang Holdings, in Cayman Islands through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. Sifang Holdings is also permitted under the laws of Cayman Islands to provide funding to Smart Powerr Corp. through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. As of the date hereof, there have not been any transfers, dividends or distributions made between the holding company, its subsidiaries, and to investors.

We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments.



Subject to the Nevada Business Corporation Act and our bylaws, our Board of Directors may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time and of such an amount as it thinks fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts as they become due.



To address persistent capital outflows and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries’ dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.



Cash dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at up to 10%.



To pay dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on payments made from our PRC subsidiaries, i.e., Shanghai Yinghua Financial Leasing Co., Ltd, Shanghai TCH Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Xi’an TCH Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd., Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and Zhongxun Energy Investment (Beijing) Co., Ltd., to Smart Powerr Corp. As of the date hereof, our PRC subsidiaries have not made any transfers or distributions. As of the date hereof, no cash or asset transfers have occurred between the Company and its subsidiaries. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as of the date hereof, no cash generated from one subsidiary is used to fund another subsidiary’s operations and we do not anticipate any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries. We have also not installed any cash management policies that dictate the amount of such funds and how such funds are transferred.



Implications of Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act



On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. In June 2021, the Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would reduce the time period for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two consecutive years instead of three years. If our auditor cannot be inspected by the PCAOB, PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of our securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions.

Each of Prager Metis CPAs, LLC (“Prager Metis”), the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included elsewhere in this annual report, and Paris Kreit & Chiu CPA (“Paris Kreit,” formerly Benjamin & Ko, LLC), the independent registered public account firm that issued the audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the U.S. and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess such auditor’s compliance with the applicable professional standards. Prager Metis is headquartered in New York, New York, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. Paris Kreit is headquartered in New York, New York, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. Therefore, we believe Prager Metis and Paris Kreit are not subject to the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, as more stringent criteria have been imposed by the SEC and the PCAOB, recently, which would add uncertainties to future offerings, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements. On August 26, 2022, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the “MOF”), and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the “Protocol”), governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. See “The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the HFCAA all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors which are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to the trading of our common stock” on page 35 of this annual report.



PRC Regulatory Permissions 



We and our operating subsidiaries currently have received all material permissions and approvals required for our operations in compliance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations in the PRC, including the business licenses of our operating subsidiaries.



The business license is a permit issued by Administration for Market Regulation that allows the company to conduct specific business within the government’s geographical jurisdiction. Each of our PRC subsidiaries has received its business license. As of the date hereof, except for the business licenses mentioned here, Smart Powerr Corp. and our PRC subsidiaries are not required to obtain any other permissions or approvals from any Chinese authorities to operate the business. However, applicable laws and regulations may be tightened, and new laws or regulations may be introduced to impose additional government approval, license, and permit requirements. If we or our subsidiaries fail to obtain and maintain such approvals, licenses, or permits required for our business, inadvertently conclude that such approval is not required, or respond to changes in the regulatory environment, we or our subsidiaries could be subject to liabilities, penalties, and operational disruption, which may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the value of our common stock, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.


On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which came into effect on September 8, 2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules requires that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for overseas listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC Citizens shall obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission prior to overseas listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. Based on our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations in effect at the time of this annual report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of future offerings and the trading of common stock on the Nasdaq under the M&A Rules. However, there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented, and the requirement standard may change when new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules are installed. We cannot assure you that relevant Chinese government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion.

Recently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Pursuant to the Opinions, Chinese regulators are required to accelerate rulemaking related to the overseas issuance and listing of securities, and update the existing laws and regulations related to data security, cross-border data flow, and management of confidential information. Numerous regulations, guidelines and other measures are expected to be adopted under the umbrella of or in addition to the Cybersecurity Law and Data Security Law. As of the date hereof, no official guidance or related implementation rules have been issued. As a result, the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities remain unclear on how they will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities.


On December 24, 2021, the CSRC, together with other relevant government authorities in China issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), and the Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (“Draft Overseas Listing Regulations”). The Draft Overseas Listing Regulations requires that a PRC domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas (“Overseas Issuance and Listing”) shall complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The Overseas Issuance and Listing includes direct and indirect issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities are conducted in PRC seeks to issue and list its shares in the name of an overseas enterprise (“Overseas Issuer”) on the basis of the equity, assets, income or other similar rights and interests of the relevant PRC domestic enterprise, such activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas issuance and listing (“Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing”) under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. Therefore, future offerings could be deemed an Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. As such, the Company would be required to complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC after the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations become effective.



On December 28, 2021, the CAC and other relevant PRC governmental authorities jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures (the “new Cybersecurity Review Measures”) which took effect on February 15, 2022 and replaced the original Cybersecurity Review Measures. Pursuant to the new Cybersecurity Review Measures, if critical information infrastructure operators purchase network products and services, or network platform operators conduct data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, they will be subject to cybersecurity review. A network platform operator holding more than one million users/users’ individual information also shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. The cybersecurity review will evaluate, among others, the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important data, or a large amount of personal information being influenced, controlled or maliciously used by foreign governments and risk of network data security after going public overseas.


We believe that neither we nor our subsidiaries are currently required to obtain permission from any of the PRC authorities to operate and issue our common stock to foreign investors, or required to obtain permission or approval from the CSRC, Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) or any other governmental agency. Recently, however, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the “Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law,” or the “Opinions,” which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, cybersecurity, data privacy protection requirements, and similar matters. The Opinions and any related implementing rules to be enacted may subject us to compliance requirements in the future. Given the current regulatory environment in the PRC, we are still subject to the uncertainty of different interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations in the PRC adverse to us, which may take place quickly with little advance notice. See “The Opinions recently issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future” on page 35 of this annual report.

We believe we will not be subject to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective on February 15, 2022 under the CAC, because we currently do not have over one million users’ personal information and do not anticipate that we will be collecting over one million users’ personal information in the foreseeable future, which we understand might check subject us to the Cybersecurity Review Measures. We are also not subject to network data security review by the CAC if the Draft Regulations on the Network Data Security Administration are enacted as proposed, since we currently do not have over one million users’ personal information and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security and we do not anticipate that we will be collecting over one million users’ personal information or data that affects or may affect national security in the foreseeable future, which we understand might otherwise subject us to the Security Administration Draft.



Moreover, we believe that no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly require us to seek approval from the CSRC for our overseas listing plan. As of the date of this annual report, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions regarding our planned overseas listing from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or the SCNPC, or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing rules that requires our company or any of our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before future offerings in the U.S. In other words, although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly; our ability to offer, or continue to offer, securities to investors would be potentially hindered and the value of our securities might significantly decline or be worthless, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental authorities, if we or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption by PRC governmental with little advance notice. For more details, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China – The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if our subsidiaries or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors” on page 25 of this annual report.



As of the date hereof, we and our PRC subsidiaries have received from PRC authorities all requisite licenses, permissions or approvals needed to engage in the businesses currently conducted in China, and no permission or approval has been denied. The following table provides details on the licenses and permissions held by our PRC subsidiaries.

Our Projects



We design, finance, construct, operate and eventually transfer waste energy recycling projects to meet the energy saving and recovery needs of our customers. Our waste energy recycling projects use the pressure, heat or gas, which is generated as a byproduct of a variety of industrial processes, to create electricity. The residual energy from industrial processes, which was traditionally wasted, may be captured in a recovery process and utilized by our waste energy recycling projects to generate electricity burning additional fuel and additional emissions. Among a wide variety of waste-to-energy technologies and solutions, we primarily focus on waste pressure to energy systems, waste heat to energy systems and waste gas power generation systems. We do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of our waste energy recycling projects. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated onsite project for our customers.
Waste Heat to Energy Systems



Waste heat to energy systems utilize waste heat generated in industrial production to generate electricity. The waste heat is trapped to heat a boiler to create steam and power a steam turbine. Our waste heat to energy systems have used waste heat from cement production and from metal production.



Shanghai TCH and its Subsidiaries



Shanghai TCH was established as a foreign investment enterprise in Shanghai under the laws of the PRC on May 25, 2004 and has a registered capital of $29.80 million.

Erdos TCH – Joint Venture



On April 14, 2009, the Company formed Erdos TCH as a joint venture (the “JV” or “Erdos TCH”) with Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd. (“Erdos”) to recycle waste heat from Erdos’ metal refining plants to generate power and steam to be sold back to Erdos. The JV has a term of 20 years with a total investment for the project estimated at $79 million (RMB 500 million) and an initial investment of $17.55 million (RMB 120 million). Erdos contributed 7% of the total investment for the project, and Xi’an TCH contributed 93%. According to Xi’an TCH and Erdos’ agreement on profit distribution, Xi’an TCH and Erdos will receive 80% and 20%, respectively, of the profit from the JV until Xi’an TCH receives the complete return of its investment. Xi’an TCH and Erdos will then receive 60% and 40%, respectively, of the profit from the JV. On June 15, 2013, Xi’an TCH and Erdos entered into a share transfer agreement, pursuant to which Erdos transferred and sold its 7% ownership interest in the JV to Xi’an TCH for $1.29 million (RMB 8 million), plus certain accumulated profits as described below. Xi’an TCH paid the $1.29 million in July 2013 and, as a result, became the sole stockholder of Erdos TCH. In addition, Xi’an TCH is required to pay Erdos accumulated profits from inception up to June 30, 2013 in accordance with the supplementary agreement entered on August 6, 2013. In August 2013, Xi’an TCH paid 20% of the accumulated profit (calculated under PRC GAAP) of $226,000 to Erdos. Erdos TCH currently has two power generation systems in Phase I with a total of 18 MW power capacity, and three power generation systems in Phase II with a total of 27 MW power capacity. The power generation systems were built in 2009, and it is now 13 years old. The equipment is obsolete and the efficiency of the power generation systems is declining year by year. The current power generation efficiency can only reach 30%, and the equipment needs to be upgraded. The Erdos government has requested the Erdos to carry out a comprehensive technical upgrade of its ferrosilicon production line to meet the city’s energy-saving targets.   Erdos is researching the technical rectification scheme. After the scheme is determined, the Company will carry out supporting technical transformation for our waste heat power station project.  Before it goes into production, the Company is still entitled to a compensation of RMB 1 million per month.



After considering the challenging economic conditions facing Erdos, and to maintain the long-term cooperative relationship between the parties, which we believe will continue to produce long-term benefits, on April 28, 2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered into a supplemental agreement, effective May 1, 2016. Under the supplemental agreement, Erdos TCH cancelled monthly minimum lease payments from Erdos, and agreed to charge Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / KWH, which such price will be adjusted annually based on prevailing market conditions.



The Company evaluated the modified terms for payments based on actual electricity sold as minimum lease payments as defined in ASC 840-10-25-4, since lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to the future use of the leased property are contingent rentals and, accordingly, are excluded from minimum lease payments in their entirety. The Company wrote off the net investment receivables of these leases at the lease modification date.



Pucheng Biomass Power Generation Projects



On June 29, 2010, Xi’an TCH entered into a Biomass Power Generation (“BMPG”) Project Lease Agreement with PuchengXinHeng Yuan Biomass Power Generation Co., Ltd.

On September 11, 2013, Xi’an TCH entered into a BMPG Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Pucheng Transfer Agreement”) with Pucheng Xin Heng Yuan Biomass Power Generation Corporation (“Pucheng”), a limited liability company incorporated in China. The Pucheng Transfer Agreement provided for the sale by Pucheng to Xi’an TCH of a set of 12 MW BMPG systems with the completion of system transformation for a purchase price of RMB 100 million ($16.48 million) in the form of 8,766,547 shares of common stock of the Company at $1.87 per share (the share and per share numbers were not adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split). Also on September 11, 2013, Xi’an TCH also entered into a BMPG Project Lease Agreement with Pucheng (the “Pucheng Lease”). Under the Pucheng Lease, Xi’an TCH leases this same set of 12 MW BMPG system to Pucheng, and combines this lease with the lease for the 12 MW BMPG station of Pucheng Phase I project, under a single lease to Pucheng for RMB 3.8 million ($0.63 million) per month (the “Pucheng Phase II Project”). The term for the consolidated lease is from September 2013 to June 2025. The lease agreement for the 12 MW station from Pucheng Phase I project terminated upon the effective date of the Pucheng Lease. The ownership of two 12 MW BMPG systems will transfer to Pucheng at no additional charge when the Pucheng Lease expires.

Industry and Market Overview



Overview of Waste-to-Energy Industry



The waste energy recycling industry concentrates mostly on power-intensive manufacturing and production processes, such as iron, steel and nonferrous metal production, cement production, and coal and petrochemical plants. Our waste energy recycling projects allow customers to recapture previously wasted pressure, heat, and gas from their manufacturing and production processes and use this waste to generate electricity. Waste energy recycling projects are installed at a customer’s facility and the electricity produced can be used on-site to lower energy costs and create a more efficient production process. The industry verticals at the vanguard of this trend are metallurgical production (including iron & steel), cement, coal mining, coke production and petrochemicals.



The industry also includes the conversion of biomass to electricity. For thousands of years, biomass, biological material derived from living organisms like plants and their byproducts, was burned to produce heat so as to convert it to energy. A number of non- combustion methods are now available to convert raw biomass into a variety of gaseous, liquid, or solid fuels that can be used directly in a power plant to generate electricity.



Waste-to-Energy Industry Growth



China has experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization in recent years, increasing the demand for electricity. In the PRC, growth in energy consumption has exceeded growth in gross domestic product, causing a shortage of electricity with blackouts and brownouts over much of the country. Much of the energy demand has been due to the expansion of energy intensive industrial sectors such as steel, cement, and chemicals. China’s increasing modernization and industrialization has made it the world’s largest consumer of energy.



One result of this massive increase in electric generation capacity has been the rise of harmful emissions. China has surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the country faces enormous challenges from the pollution brought about by its consumption of conventional energy. On September 12, 2013, the State Council released the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control. The action plan proposed that in five years, China will witness the overall improvement of air quality and dramatic drop of seriously polluted days. China will strive to gradually eliminate the seriously polluted weather and notably better the national air quality in another five years or longer.



Description of WGPG (Waste Gas Power Generation)



During the process of industrial production, some by-products, such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, oil gas, and others are created with certain high intensive thermal energy. The waste gas can be collected and used as a fuel by gas turbine system to generate power energy.



Gas turbines are a set of hi-tech equipment and devices that is crucial to the energy development strategy of China. Gas turbine, which uses flammable gas as fuel and combines with recycling power generating technology, has many merits. These include high efficiency power generation, low investment, short construction periods, small land usage, water savings, environment protection and more. We believe the market prospect of the gas turbine industry is promising.



Through years of research, development and experimental applications, this gas-to-energy system has started to be applied into some high energy intensive industrial plants, such as in the course of iron-smelting in metallurgy plants. Metallurgical enterprises, as the biggest industrial energy user in China, consume 13%-15% of the nation’s electricity. Electricity consumed by the iron-smelting industry accounts for 40% of that consumed by metallurgical enterprises. If all top furnaces in the iron-smelting industry are equipped with gas recovery systems, electricity consumption may decrease by 30-45%. Furthermore, environmental pollution will be reduced while energy efficiency is improved in those heavy industries.





16







Stringent Environmental Standards and Increasing Government Supports



Since energy is a major strategic issue affecting the development of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government has promoted the development of recycling and encouraged enterprises to use waste energy recycling projects of the type we sell and service. Similar to previous five year periods, the China National Environment Protection Plan, for the 14th Five-Year period (2021-2025), under the goal of “carbon neutrality and carbon peak,” proposes to accelerate green and low-carbon development, continuously improve environmental quality, enhance the quality and stability of ecosystems, and comprehensively improve the efficiency of resource utilization. Given the worsening environment and insufficient energy supply in China, the Chinese government has implemented policies to curb pollution and reduce wasteful energy usage. From 2020 to 2025, China will reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 13.5% and carbon dioxide emission per unit of GDP by 18%. The Renewable Energy Law, strict administrative measures to restrict investment and force consolidation in energy wasting industries, and the requirement to install energy-saving and environment protecting equipment whenever possible are just some ways the government is emphasizing the need to reduce emissions and to maximize energy creation. Local government officials, who sometimes flout central government policies for the sake of local GDP growth, are now required to tie emission, energy usage and pollution to GDP growth. If local emissions of pollutants grow faster than the local GDP, these local officials face the risk of losing their jobs. Such determination and strict enforcement by the central and local governments provide a good backdrop and growth opportunity for CREG’s business activities.



In recent years, China attaches great importance to the problem of environmental pollution, and has invested a lot of manpower and capital cost in air pollution control. It is estimated that the output value of China’s energy conservation and environmental protection industry will exceed RMB 10 trillion by 2022 and reach RMB 12.3 trillion by 2023. 






According to the “14th Five-Year Plan for Modern Energy System”, by 2025, China’s comprehensive annual energy production capacity will reach over 4.6 billion tons of standard coal, the annual output of crude oil will rise and stabilize at 200 million tons, the annual output of natural gas will reach over 230 billion cubic meters, and the total installed power generation capacity will reach about 3 billion kilowatts. By 2025, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of industrial added value will be cut by 18%. China aims to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.



The scale of China’s energy conservation and environmental protection industry will continue to expand under the impetus of a series of goals and plans of “carbon neutrality and carbon peak” and the “14th Five-Year Plan.”  According to forward-looking analysis, the output value of China’s energy conservation and environmental protection industry is expected to exceed RMB19 trillion by 2027.

Waste-to-Energy is a Cost-Effective Means to Meet Rising Energy Needs



According to the International Energy Agency, China will need to increase its electricity generating capacity to meet its future needs. This demand may mean price increases for electricity in China. With the need for more energy, in particular energy that does not cause additional emissions, and the relative low price of the waste-to-energy production we provide, we believe that our markets will continue to expand.



Since China has been experiencing a dramatic surge in its energy consumption as well as widespread energy shortages, recycling energy is not only an attractive alternative to other sources of energy as part of a national diversification strategy to avoid dependence on any one energy source or politically sensitive energy supplies, but also a proven solution to make the use of energy more efficient. Under current economic conditions and current tax and regulatory regimes, waste energy recycling projects generally can create price- competitive electricity compared to electricity generated from fossil fuels or other renewable sources. Our customers can reduce energy costs significantly by installing our waste energy recycling projects. Compared to electricity from the national grid, the generating cost from recycling energy is lower, which means our customers can leverage the waste-to-energy projects to generate low-cost electricity, reducing energy costs for the manufacturing process. The current national grid electricity rate ranges from RMB 0.45-0.50/kWh and our operated recycling rate ranges from 0.35-0.45/kWh subject to project type, generating scale and local situation.



Customers of our energy recycling projects may also qualify for credits from the Clean Development Mechanism (“CDM”). The CDM is an international arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing industrialized countries with a greenhouse gas reduction commitment to invest in ventures that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries. In 2005, China’s government promulgated “Measures for Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects in China” (“China CDM Measures”) to facilitate the application and operation of CDM project activities in China. Our energy recycling solutions are of a kind which falls into the beneficial categories accredited by the China CDM Measures. If our customers can get approval from the Chinese government and successfully register their projects in the United Nations’ CDM Executive Board, they can receive additional revenue income through exchanging their Certified Emission Reductions (“CER”) credits with investors in industrialized countries.



Trends in Industries We Principally Service



Iron, Steel and Nonferrous Metal Industry



As the biggest iron and steel producer in the world and one of the highest CO2 emission sectors, China’s iron and steel industry is undergoing a low-carbon transition accompanied by remarkable technological progress and investment adjustment, in response to the macroeconomic climate and policy intervention.



Environmental pollution, shortage of resources and energy shortage have been identified in China as three major challenges for China’s nonferrous metal industry. China aims to save 1.7 million tons of coal and 6 billion kWh of electricity per year, as well as reduce sulfur dioxide by 850,000 tons annually as part of the industrial upgrading for the nonferrous metallurgy sector and, at the same time, to improve the utilization efficiency for resources. In China, the utilization rate for the nonferrous metal mineral resources is 60%, which is 10 to 15% lower than developed countries. The utilization rate for associated nonferrous metals is only 40%, which is 20% lower than developed nations. In addition, parts of nonferrous mines located in different cities are disorganized with random mining, causing severe wastes of resources.



Coal and Petrochemicals



Flammable waste gases emitted from industrial production processes, such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, oil or gas can be used to power gas-fired generators to create energy. Two large producers of these waste gases are coal mining and petrochemical refining. The PRC is the largest coal producer and consumer in the world. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and a major cause of methane gas emissions, a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane gas is found naturally in coal beds. In the 1950s, China began recovering methane to make mines safer. Now, as then, most of the captured methane is released into the air but it could be used as a clean energy source using waste energy recycling technologies.





18







Biomass Waste-to-Energy Industry



In China, agricultural waste and biogas are two main sources for biomass waste. China has more than 600 million tons of wasted straw produced every year. It also has 19 billion tons of forest biomass, of which 300 million tons can be utilized as an energy source. The straw burning power industry will grow faster in China with supportive policies, development of new technologies and the formation of raw material collection and storage systems, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Electricity generated from straw has a preferential price of RMB 0.25 per kWh higher than coal-fueled power when sold to the state grid. In addition, straw power plants enjoy a series of preferential policies including tax exemption.



Biogas technology captures methane gases emitted from compostable materials and burns it to power a turbine to produce electricity. The waste that is usually disposed of in landfills is converted into liquid or gaseous fuels. By utilizing the resource from waste cellulosic or organic materials, biomass energy can be generated through the fermentation process.



Our Strategies



Maintain Core Verticals to Increase Market Share in China



We focus on waste-to-energy projects for specific verticals, such as steel, cement, nonferrous metal and coal mining. We plan to continue our focus on such core verticals and leverage our expertise to expand our market share. We intend to expand our waste-to-energy power generating capacity rapidly in order to meet the anticipated growth of demand in China’s energy efficiency industrial applications and to gain market share. We continually identify potential customers in our core verticals.
Expand to New Business of Energy Storage with Future High Growth Potentials



We are in the process of transforming into an energy storage integrated solution provider. We plan to pursue disciplined and targeted expansion strategies for market areas that we currently do not serve. We are actively seeking and exploring opportunities to apply energy storage technologies to new industries or segments with high growth potential, including industrial and commercial complexes, large scale photovoltaic (PV) and wind power stations, remote islands without electricity, and smart energy cities with multi-energy supplies. By supporting and motivating all kinds of the electric power market to participant in resource development and utilization of demand response, we plan to provide services including peak shaving with compensation and frequency modulation.



In recent years, electrochemical energy storage technology has maintained a rapid growth trend, the cumulative installed capacity continues to expand. In 2020, the accumulative installed capacity of electrochemical energy storage in China was 3269.2MW. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, it is an important period for energy storage to explore and realize the “rigid demand” application of the market, to productize the system and to obtain stable commercial interests. It is expected that the electrochemical energy storage market will continue to develop rapidly in 2021, with the accumulative installed capacity reaching 5790.8MW.



In April 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Development of New Type Energy Storage. This is the second national comprehensive policy document on the energy storage industry since the National Energy Administration, together with five ministries and commissions, issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of China’s Energy Storage Technology and Industry in 2017 (the “New Energy Storage Guidance”). The New Energy Storage Guidance establishes a “double carbon” goal, providing a development goal and direction for the industry.



The New Energy Storage Guidance, for the first time, explicitly quantified the development “double carbon” goals of the energy storage industry at the national level, and it is estimated that more than 30 million kilowatts (30GW+) of new energy storage projects will be installed by 2025. From 3.28GW at the end of 2020 to 30GW in 2025, the scale of the new energy storage market is expected to expand 10 times the current level in the next five years, with an annual compound annual growth rate of more than 55%, as a consequence of the New Energy Storage Guidance.





19







Continually Enhance Research and Development Efforts



We plan to devote resources to research and development in order to enhance our waste-to-energy design and engineering capabilities. We anticipate that our in-house design and engineering team will provide additional competitive advantages, including flexibility to quickly design and evaluate new technologies or applications in response to changing market trends.
Our Business Models



We have sold our products to our customers under two models: the BOT model and the operating lease model, although we emphasize the BOT model which we believe is more economically beneficial to us and to our customers.



BOT Model



We primarily engage in the BOT model to provide waste-to-energy solutions to our customers:



“Build”



We work directly with customers for each of our waste-to-energy projects. Our working process starts with a team of engineers that assesses and analyzes the specific needs of the customer to establish the design layout, equipment procurement list and capital expenditure budget for the project. Our sales team works closely with our engineering staff to present and negotiate the model with the customer.


After signing a contract, we finance the entire capital expenditure budget ourselves and commence the construction and installation of the project. We do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of the waste-to-energy power generation facility. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated on-site waste energy recycling project for our customer. The construction and installation period ranges from three to 12 months subject to the project type, size and complexity.



We usually engage an EPC general contractor, which experienced in power plant and waste energy recycling project construction, to take charge of equipment procurement, project construction and installation. Our team of five engineers participates in and monitors the equipment purchase process; this team also oversees the construction and installation activities to ensure that they are completed on time and meet our rigorous standards and specifications.



“Operate”



After the project has been installed at the customer site and passed a series of stringent tests, we, currently, outsource the operation to a third-party vendor. The operation period ranges from five to 20 years subject to the terms of each contract.



During the operation period, the customer can purchase all the electricity at a below-market price. We collect energy-saving- based lease payments from the customer; the lease term is equivalent to the operation period, ranging from five to 20 years, and the payments are based on the sale by us as lessor to our customers as lessee of energy generated by the waste energy recycling project at below-market rates. The customer’s payments are based on a minimum operation schedule agreed upon by us with our customer, and are collateralized by assets of the customer and/or third party guarantees. To reduce risk, we offer leasing services across a wide variety of industries and only target larger manufacturers or state-owned enterprises. Operation in excess of the minimum schedule enables us to receive additional revenues from the excess energy generated and sold to the customer.





20







“Transfer”



Based on the specific terms for each project, we eventually transfer the waste energy recycling project to the customer at no cost or a nominal cost upon the completion of the operation/lease period. For example, Tongchuan Shengwei Cement Power Generation project signed a 9-year lease starting from the first quarter of 2009 to the end of 2013. After the lease term was up, we transferred the station to the owner at no cost pursuant to the contract terms, which vary based on industries and the type of power generation stations.



Why BOT



Waste-to-energy projects are capital intensive, which requires the manufacturers to invest a considerable amount of cash to purchase equipment during the construction period. As a BOT service provider, we fund all contracted projects on our own or jointly with our customers; such financing arrangements can help our customers by removing or reducing the heavy capital expenditure burden required by specific projects, thereby allowing them to concentrate on their core business. While technologically mature in advanced countries, waste-to-energy projects are still new to most of China’s industrial companies and require intensive technology or know-how with respect to energy recycling and power generation. It is time-consuming or not feasible for industrial manufacturers to equip themselves with adequate expertise and technicians. Our specific sector knowledge and rich project experience allow us to construct, operate and maintain the power plants efficiently and to respond to operational issues in a timely and cost-efficient manner.



In exchange for upfront capital investment, we require secured power generating capacity during the operation period and guaranteed attractive internal rates of return from each project. Our operation period ranges from five to 20 years, during which we are entitled to sell the recycled electricity to those customers at a predetermined rate. Such electricity sales are secured by long-term electricity production agreements with guarantees, which result in minimum annual payments. We employ a process of stringent and systematic internal scrutiny on new customer development so as to minimize operational and default risk; for some smaller or non-SOE businesses, we require property collateral, management or third party guarantees, and/or prepayment of three months. As such, our cash inflow schedule from each in-operation project is fixed and predictable providing clear financial visibility. Our payback period is generally two to three years, depending on the project size.



In our experience, this BOT model is well received by our existing and potential customers in China. The insufficient supply of BOT vendors to the market is wholly due to the funding limitations of most of the recycling energy solution providers. Not all of our competitors have the ability to access sufficient capital on a timely basis.



Operating Lease Model



In the past, we also recorded rental income from two separate one-year operating leases. Under the operating leases, we leased waste-energy systems and subleased the systems to a customer for a greater amount. We choose not to renew our lease agreements, and we do not generally expect any revenue in the future through such model.
Contractor and Equipment Suppliers



We generally conduct our project construction through an EPC general contractor. We select the EPC general contractor for each project through a bidding process; then we sign a contract with the selected contractor for that project. The general contractor may outsource parts of our project construction to subcontractors according to the complexity and economics of the project. The general contractor is responsible for purchasing equipment to satisfy the requirements of the project we design for our customer. We generally do not purchase equipment directly from the equipment suppliers, but our general contractors obtain our consent before selecting the equipment suppliers. Our engineering department is involved in the equipment supplier selection process together with our general contractors and makes sure our stringent standards and requirements have been appropriately applied in selection of the equipment. We currently have engaged Shaanxi Huaxin Energy Engineering Co., Ltd. for our projects under construction, and we also maintain relationships with many other quality general contractors in China, including Wuxi Guolian, CITIC Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., A-Power Energy Generation Systems, Ltd.





21







As mentioned above, we do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of our waste energy recycling projects. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated onsite system. The key equipment used in our projects are the boilers and turbine generators, which represent the majority of equipment cost for each project. Though we do not place the direct procurement orders, we believe we maintain good relationships with those power generation equipment suppliers, and these relationships help provide cost-effective equipment purchasing by the general contractor for our intended projects and ensure the timely completion of these projects. We have well-established business relationships with most of the suppliers from whom our general contractors procure equipment, including Hangzhou Boiler Plant, Beijing Zhongdian Electric Machinery, Chengdu Engine Group, Shanghai Electric Group, China Aviation Gas Turbine Co. Ltd and Xuji Electric. Therefore, we believe that we have a strong position and support in equipment supply and installation, which benefits us, the general contractors and our customers.



Main Customers



Our customers are mainly mid- to large-size enterprises in China involving high energy-consuming businesses. Following our selection process described in the next paragraph, we conduct stringent evaluation procedures to identify and qualify potential customers and projects. To lower our investment and operational risk, we target companies with geographic or industry competitive advantages, with strong reputations and in good financial condition. Generally, our targets include steel and nonferrous metal mills with over 3 million tons of production capacity per year, cement plants with over 2 million tons of production capacity per year that utilize new- suspension-line process, and coking plants with over 600 tons production capacity per year. Our existing customers operate in Shanxi, Shaan’xi, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region in China.
Marketing and Sales



We market and sell our projects nationwide through our direct sales force of two employees based in Xi’an, China. Our marketing programs include industrial conferences, trade fairs, sales training, and trade publication advertising. Our sales and marketing group works closely with our research and development and engineering departments to coordinate our project development activities, project launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. We market our projects directly to the industrial manufacturers who can utilize our energy recovery projects in their manufacturing processes, including steel, cement, nonferrous metal, coal and petrochemical industries.



Our management team has long-standing relationships with our existing customers and those companies that we consider to be potential customers. We also maintain relationships with municipal governments, which often sponsor or subsidize potential customers that can utilize our projects.



Geographic Distribution of Sales



Sales outside the U.S. accounted for 100% of revenue in 2021 and 2020.



Seasonality



For the most part, the Company’s business and sales are not subject to any seasonality factors.



Intellectual Property Rights



The Company does not currently possess any intellectual property rights.

 

Research and Development



We believe that our research and development (“R&D”) efforts are among the best in the waste heat, gas and pressure to energy industry, particularly with regards to practical usage and application.



To develop new and practical solutions for our customers, our R&D team also has the support of our on-site and project engineers who provide feedback and numerous ideas to the R&D team from their daily experiences with installation and operation of various waste gas, heat or pressure to energy projects. Our cooperative relationship with the Shanghai Electric Distributed Energy Sources Technology Co., Ltd. gives us access to the latest developments in energy and waste-to-energy technologies as well as technical support of the R&D teams of the R & D team of Distributed Energy Sources of Central Research Institute of Shanghai Electric Group.





22







Government and Environmental Management System



Since we do not hold the licenses that the various levels of Chinese government require for our operations, we mainly rely on third-party servicers and contractors, which possess all levels of licenses, to carry out our operations.
Competition


In the past, waste energy recycling projects have been installed mainly by industrial plants themselves. These plants hire general contractors to purchase waste energy recycling equipment manufactured by third parties and with design support from government design institutes, which usually charge a one-time design fee, construct the projects on-site. Pressure has increased on Chinese producers to become more energy-efficient, but many mid-sized companies do not have the special technical expertise or the capital to install and operate such waste energy recycling projects. Many companies have begun to outsource these functions to third- party providers, creating an opportunity in a growing market.



We use a BOT model to provide energy saving and recovery systems for various energy intensive industries, such as cement, steel and metallurgy industries. We face competition from an array of market participants.



Our main competitors as third-party providers are state owned research institutes or their wholly owned construction companies; however, smaller private companies occasionally employ a BOT model to provide waste-to-energy systems. The state-owned enterprises include Equipment and System Engineer Co., Ltd. of Hangzhou Steam Turbine & Power Group (Hangzhou Turbine) and Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd of China National Material Group, Sinoma Development Co., Ltd. The private companies include China Senyuan Electronic Co., Ltd., Dalian East New Energy Development Co. Ltd., Top Resource Conservation Engineering Co., Ltd. and Nanjing Kaisheng Kaineng Environmental Energy.


We believe there is a larger market in the waste-to-energy industry in China for systems constructed on the “Engineering Procurement Construction” or “EPC” model in which customers purchase the services of a contractor to construct a system for the customer at the customer’s expense. Service providers include Dalian East New Energy Development, Nanjing Kaisheng Cement Technology and Engineering Co., Ltd., Jiangxi Sifang Energy Co., Ltd., Beijing Century Benefits Co., Ltd., Beijing Shineng Zhongjin Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Kunming Sunwise Co., Ltd. and China Everbright International Ltd. We compete with EPC providers for waste-to-energy projects when potential customers are able to obtain external financing or have the necessary capital.



We believe we offer advantages over our competitors in several ways:




● | Our management team has over 20 years of industry experience and expertise; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have the capabilities to provide TRT, CHPG and WGPG systems, while our competitors usually concentrate on one type or another; 
● | We have the capabilities and experience in undertaking large scale projects; and 
● | We provide BOT or capital lease services to the customers, while our competitors usually use an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) or turnkey contract model.

There were many new laws, regulations, rules and notices regarding the environment and energy production adopted, promulgated and put into force during past years. The Chinese government is putting more stringent requirements and urgency on reducing pollution and emissions and improving energy efficiency nationwide. Our products are designed and constructed to comply with the environmental laws and regulations of China. As our systems allow our customers to use waste heat and gases to create energy, we help reduce the overall environmental impact of our customers. Since our business focuses on recycling energy, the effect of the strengthening of environmental laws in China may be to increase demand for the products and services we offer and others like them.
