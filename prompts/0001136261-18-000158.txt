ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview A provider of enterprise cloud communications solutions, 8x8 helps businesses get their employees, customers and applications talking, and to make people more connected and productive worldwide. From a unified, proprietary platform, we offer unified communications, team collaboration, conferencing, contact center, analytics and other services to our business customers on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.  2   Small businesses were the first to transition their communications to the cloud starting several years ago, often based on its cost effectiveness, ease of deployment and inherent flexibility. Now, larger businesses that have adopted cloud-based solutions for other applications and processes are increasingly looking to modernize their communications in a similar fashion. We believe this adoption is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications systems; the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premises systems, which has worsened as workforces have become more distributed and international; and the proliferation of personal mobile devices in the workplace. Our solutions offer businesses a secure, reliable and simplified approach for businesses to transition their legacy, on-premises communications systems to the cloud. Our comprehensive solution, built from core cloud technologies that we own and manage internally, enables 8x8 customers to rely on a single provider for their global communications, contact center and customer support requirements. Combining these services allows our customers to eliminate information silos and expose vital, real-time communications data spanning multiple services, applications and devices which, in turn, can improve productivity, business performance and customer experience. Our customers are spread across more than 150 countries and range from small businesses to large enterprises with more than 10,000 employees. In recent years, we have increased our focus on the mid-market and enterprise customer segments, and in fiscal 2018, we generated a majority of our new services revenue from customers in these business segments.  The Challenge Businesses today face increasing cost and complexity with deployments of communications and collaboration solutions. Companies of all sizes are managing a global, distributed workforce that seeks to leverage multiple forms of communication in their day-to-day interactions. The rapid rise of mobile devices in the enterprise has created demand for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) integration as part of a typical business' communications needs. CIOs and IT leaders are also increasingly focused on delivering superior customer experience as a strategic priority, and seeking ways to leverage their communications infrastructure to enable more personalized and productive customer interactions. Companies are looking to increase their competitive edge by also integrating their communications with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Human Capital Management (HCM) applications, and other back-office IT (information technology) systems within their communications infrastructure. Further complicating matters, business users are circumventing their IT departments by using a variety of self-selected third-party tools for team communications and collaboration, driving a shift in the buying center for communications and collaboration from IT to individuals, a phenomenon known in the industry as "shadow IT." We believe traditional on-premises communications systems are unable to accommodate all of these needs in a cost-efficient manner. In addition to being difficult to deploy and expensive to maintain in multiple locations for a globally distributed workforce, these solutions often fail to provide the mobility, business continuity and integration capabilities required by modern business customers. BYOD demands from employees further complicate the delivery of a company-wide communication system using on-premises equipment. The result is a patchwork of communications systems with security risks that stretch across the organization and lost productivity. The 8x8 Solution We offer a scalable cloud communications platform comprising voice, chat, team collaboration, contact center, and analytics for businesses of all sizes across the globe. The key attributes of the 8x8 solution include: 
Intelligent Communication and Collaboration within a Single Integrated Software Platform. We believe that integrated communications and collaboration drives more
efficient employee and customer engagement and greater business productivity. We are unique among our competitors in that we own the core technology and manage the platform behind all
of our services (voice, call center and collaboration). We believe having control over our entire platform enables us to deliver a more unified and seamless experience for our customers across
all aspects of the service — from the user interface, to the technical support experience. In addition, our 8x8 Sameroom technology helps our customers tear down information silos by providing
interoperability among multiple third-party collaboration tools. 
 
Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. We have developed a suite of web-based analytics tools to help customers make informed decisions
based on underlying communications data associated with 8x8 services and supported devices. We continue to make strategic investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) to develop new capabilities and features for our customers such as context-rich customer engagements, intelligent call routing and faster first-call resolution.  3   
Global Reach®. 8x8's Global Reach® initiative refers to our global strategy to provide enterprise-grade quality of service, reliability, security and support for
our multinational customers. Our platform utilizes intelligent geo-routing technology, and leverages 15 data centers across seven dispersed regions - United States, Canada, United Kingdom,
Continental Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia - to provide consistently high call quality to customers worldwide. 
Integration with Third-Party Business Applications. Our software uses a combination of open application program interfaces (APIs) and pre-built integrations to
retrieve contextually relevant data from, and to enhance the functionality of, customers' third-party applications, including Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Google, NetSuite, Zendesk, Oracle
Sales Cloud, Bullhorn, and Hubspot. 
Intuitive User Experience.  Our web, desktop and mobile interfaces act as the communications portal for all 8x8 services and provide customers with a familiar
and consistent user experience across all endpoints. 
Rapid Deployment. Business agility in the global, modern economy is a competitive necessity, and we embrace the notion that communication services should be
deployable as quickly as possible. Our services can generally be provisioned in minutes from web-based administrative tools. We have automated our provisioning, billing and other systems to
provide greater speed and flexibility in deployment for our customers. To ensure consistency and quality across our products and customer base, we have developed a standard, yet flexible,
deployment methodology that we refer to as Elite Touch®. We apply this systematic approach to all of our deployments, regardless of size or complexity. 
Committed Service Quality over the Public Internet. We currently offer our qualifying enterprise customers an "end-to-end" service level agreement (SLA), with
meaningful uptime and voice quality commitments, backed by service credits and a no-penalty early termination right for the customer under specified conditions. 
Emphasis on Security and Compliance.  We have invested heavily in achieving compliance with various industry standards, and we believe we have created a
top-down culture of security and compliance, including a commitment to secure architecture and development. Our Strategy We are committed to developing and delivering the most innovative, reliable, scalable and secure cloud software for global business communications. Our strategy is informed by evolving market dynamics, including the growing adoption of cloud communications, collaboration and contact center software by larger commercial and enterprise customers, along with the unique attributes of our technology. Key elements of our strategy include: 
Positioning, Selling and Supporting our X Series Product Line. We expect to launch 8x8's latest product innovation, X Series, in or around June 2018. Exemplifying our
vision of a truly unified customer engagement solution, we expect X-Series to be an array of packaged offerings that have increasingly powerful engagement capabilities, including the
packages that combine traditionally segregated unified communications and contact center services into a single comprehensive offering. We intend to continue investing in positioning, selling
and supporting X-Series.
Providing Superior, Enterprise Grade Functionality. We have invested in our software and software delivery infrastructure to provide a high-level of availability,
reliability, security and compliance, and will continue to invest in this area. We intend to continue to expand our customer deployment and support capabilities, including our program
management, professional services, and partner delivery capabilities, to meet the needs of larger, multinational customers.
Delivering One System of Engagement, providing for One System of Intelligence. We believe business communications solutions are increasingly
requiring a breadth of software capabilities, from simple voice and team collaboration to complex multi-channel contact center capabilities, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe our
ability to deliver a full spectrum of capabilities within a single cloud platform from a single vendor is a competitive advantage, especially for larger customers. We refer to this comprehensive set
of services and capabilities that manages all communications into and out of an enterprise on a single cloud platform as a "system of engagement." By providing a common set of
interaction capabilities and information about how an enterprise communicates with customers, partners, and employees, the "system of engagement" becomes the key business
system to improve customer, partner, and employee experience with that enterprise. Additionally, we plan to continue expanding these services within our platform, including extending our
contact center capabilities, adding deeper collaboration services, and bringing to market an increasing number of analytics-driven applications — in the process further enhancing the system of
engagement to what we refer to as a "system of intelligence." 
Expanding our Global Footprint. As more and more businesses establish international operations, we believe companies will view traditional communication solutions
bridging multiple geographies and carrier networks as cumbersome and expensive. We will continue to focus on expanding our ability to effectively and efficiently deliver our services into the
countries and regions we currently serve. In addition, we plan to continue expanding the distribution of our services into new countries through a combination of organic growth, regional
acquisitions, and channel partners.

Acquiring Strategic Assets. We continue to identify, acquire and integrate strategic technologies, assets and businesses to expand the breadth and adoption of our
cloud software offerings and drive growth, both domestically and internationally. Our Products Powered by company-owned and managed technologies, 8x8's solutions serve businesses of all sizes, scaling readily to serve large, globally distributed enterprise customers. All of our core software components work together and can be combined into different bundles depending on the business needs of our customers. Over the course of fiscal 2018, we offered a variety of classic  products: 
8x8 Virtual Office is a self-contained, feature rich, end-to-end solution that delivers high quality voice and unified communications-as-a-service globally. 
8x8 Virtual Contact Center is a multi-channel cloud-based contact center solution that enables even the smallest contact center to enjoy customer experience and agent
productivity benefits that were previously available only to large contact centers at a much higher cost. 
8x8 Virtual Office Meetings is a cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration solution that enables secure, continuous collaboration with borderless high definition
(HD) video and audio communications from mobile and desktop devices anywhere in the world. 
8x8 Sameroom provides an interoperability platform that enables cross-team messaging and collaboration within a large organization and between organizations. With the
Sameroom technology, our customers can collaborate across more than twenty disparate team messaging solutions. 
Script8 (Scripting Engine) is a dynamic communications flow and routing engine that offers a scripting environment for intelligently routing communications data for specific
workflows. Script8 allows end-users to create simple, personalized and customizable communications experiences, including communications control, external data source integration and
intelligent routing.
 While these components have worked well together, the capabilities of these products are being further integrated into a unified suite that we refer to as 8x8 X Series. We began releasing integrated product suites during our fiscal 2018 with offerings such as Virtual Office X8 Editions. During fiscal 2019, we will be accelerating the transition by driving X Series adoption. We intend to offer the following product plans and capabilities in the 8x8 X Series: 
X1 through X4 are integrated suites that will provide efficient, intelligent, cloud-based, enterprise engagement solutions. The packages will deliver high quality voice and
unified communications-as-a-service globally, enabling end users to use a single business phone number to place and receive calls at any supported device (including desktop phones,
computers with the 8x8 desktop software installed and mobile devices with the 8x8 mobile app installed) over a broadband internet connection. Additionally, in ascending order, each package
will incrementally offer more features expected by demanding communications and collaboration customers today, such as auto attendants; worldwide extension dialing; corporate directory
with click-to-call functionality; presence, messaging and chat; call recording; call monitoring; internet fax; and the ability to interact contextually with inbound communication (email, call or chat).
Customers can mix and match packages within their business to most effectively meet the needs of individual users.
X Series Meetings is a cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration solution that enables secure, continuous collaboration with borderless high definition (HD) video
and audio communications from mobile and desktop devices anywhere in the world. Meetings is integrated within the X Series desktop and mobile experience, allowing users to schedule

Open Team Messaging Platform provides an integrated open team messaging platform to facilitate modern modes of communication with support for direct messages,
public and private team messaging rooms, short messaging service (SMS), presence, emojis, and @mentions. 8x8 Sameroom technology provides interoperability between 8x8 Team
Messaging and 3rd party messaging platforms for cross-team messaging and collaboration interactions between internal and external departments and organizations.
X5 through X8 will deliver employee experience and deep customer engagement through integrated cloud communication, contact center software and collaboration
solutions. These packages build off the preceding X Series bundles, adding intelligent, easy-to-use, rapid to deploy cloud contact center solutions or more robust omni-channel cloud contact
center solutions. Additionally, each package will incrementally offer different features, such as self-services configuration, programmable IVR tool, automatic queuing and routing, skills-based
routing, browser-based agent console, multimedia management, real-time monitoring and reporting, internal chat, voice recording and logging, historical reporting, customer call back, contact
and case management tools, and speech analytics. Our Technology We introduced our first communications SaaS offering in 2002, and have since expanded our solutions, features and capabilities. Our services are powered by internally-owned and operated technologies and are delivered to our customers from our cloud communications platform. From inception through March 31, 2018 we have been awarded more than 150 United States patents covering a variety of voice and video communications, signaling, processing, analytics, and storage technologies. Many of our current patents apply to the communications software used in our various SaaS solutions. We developed our Global Reach patented technology with the goal of ensuring that 8x8 voice communications, placed or received anywhere on the globe on any compatible device, can have the same consistent quality as a local call within a single area code. Many hosted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions route call data through the same, predetermined data center, regardless of the physical or geographic location of callers. By contrast, when an end-user makes a call using our solution, our patented technology seeks out the closest data center to the caller's location, subject to service quality, security and data sovereignty considerations. We call this "geo-routing." Our proprietary technologies take into account current Internet and carrier network conditions and determine the best route virtually instantaneously, ensuring that latency is minimized within the available routing options. Our software solutions provide mission critical services to our business customers. Therefore, we have developed technologies and architectures that embed high reliability and uptime into our software.  We believe one of the key areas that differentiates 8x8 from our competitors is the quality of our real-time service delivery over the public Internet. Real-time voice is perhaps the most difficult application to be delivered over the public Internet as there is no time for retransmission and there is little buffering that can be done without impacting the quality of a real-time conversation. As such, quality of the connection well beyond just the available bandwidth is the most important element of service delivery for VoIP. By having diverse routes and connectivity as well as full and granular Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) control over these connections, 8x8 is constantly inspecting the state of the Internet to optimize our service delivery to customers. In addition, we have instrumented hundreds of thousands of 8x8 endpoints to provide details of quality of connection information at the end of each call to 8x8's internal network operations environment. This is possible due to our full control over the core networking stack and the transit connections in our data centers.  Our technologies include a number of deployment methodologies that promote consistency and efficiency in the implementation of our services , while driving customer adoption of our more advanced software features. We also manage and port existing business numbers globally, and we provide local number porting services in more than 40 countries. Our software provides connectivity to emergency services and other services required by telecommunications regulations in different regions of the world. We have developed our own proprietary billing software which is closely integrated with our products. Finally, a key aspect of our technology, especially critical for larger enterprise customers and certain industry verticals, such as healthcare, is our emphasis on security and compliance, which we have addressed through specific measures such as our end-to-end encryption technologies and certifications with various regulations and industry standards as described above.  6  
Sales, Marketing and Promotional Activities We market our services directly to end users through a variety of means, including search engine marketing and optimization, third-party lead generation sources, industry conferences, trade shows, webinars, and digital advertising channels. We employ a direct sales organization, consisting of inside and field-based sales agents, and we partner with an indirect channel partner network consisting of value-added resellers (VARs), master agents, independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators and service providers. We typically contract directly with the end customer and use these channel partners to identify, qualify and manage prospects throughout the sales cycle, although we also have arrangements with a number of partners who resell our services to their own customers, with whom we do not contract directly. For mid-market and enterprise customers, our sales professionals work closely with inside technical support, sales engineers and deployment specialists to develop customized solution proposals based on individual customer requirements. In fiscal 2018, we invested in new and unique demand generation programs for our channel partners, including new partner enablement tracks with dedicated resources, online customer return on investment (ROI) tools, co-branded marketing materials and our "PartnerConnect" portal which, among other capabilities, allows partners to launch and manage multi-touch digital co- marketing campaigns.  We also continued to invest in developing partner deployment and support certification programs. We believe the 8x8 partner channel strategy has been a critical component of our strategy for winning large and mid-market enterprise business, and in this most recent fiscal year, we significantly expanded and enhanced our global partner program. Competition Given the size and stage of the current market opportunity and the breadth of our communications and collaboration service platform, we face competition from many companies, including other cloud services providers, communications and collaboration software vendors and incumbent telephone companies and other resellers of legacy communications equipment. For more information regarding the risks associated with such competition, please refer to our "Risk Factors" below. Cloud Communications and Contact Center Services Providers For customers looking to implement cloud-based communications, we compete with other cloud communication software providers such as RingCentral, Fuze, Vonage, Five9 and InContact/Nice. We believe that the integration of our services over a common platform, including contact center, differentiates our services from those offered by these competitors.  Large Internet and Cloud Services Vendors We also face competition from communications and collaboration software vendors such as Cisco, Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, some of which are well established in the communications industry while others have only recently begun to market cloud communications solutions. Some of these competitors have developed strong software solutions for its respective communications and/or collaboration silo. Many of these competitors are substantially larger, better capitalized, and more well-known than we are. However, we believe that a collective deployment of these software solutions is likely to be more expensive and cumbersome for customers, when compared to similar deployments of our services. Incumbent Telephony Companies and Legacy Equipment Providers Our cloud-based software replaces wire line business voice services sold by incumbent telephone and cable companies such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Comcast, and Verizon Communications, often in conjunction with on-premises hardware solutions from companies like Avaya, Cisco and Mitel. We believe that the solutions offered by these competitors are typically more expensive to adopt, require cumbersome on-premises implementations, and need regular hardware and IT infrastructure upgrades. Furthermore, the offerings often do not provide all the functionality needed for larger customers to integrate their communication systems with their IT infrastructure, therefore requiring additional system integration investments.  7   
Operations Our operations infrastructure consists of data management, monitoring, control, and billing systems that support all of our products and services. We have invested substantial resources to develop and implement our real-time call management information system. Key elements of our operations infrastructure include a prospective customer quotation portal, customer provisioning, customer access, fraud control, network security, call routing, call monitoring, media processing and normalization, call reliability, detailed call record storage and billing and integration with third-party applications. We maintain a call-switching platform in software that manages call admission, call control and call rating and routes calls to an appropriate destination or customer premises equipment. Network Operations Center We maintain global network operations centers at our headquarters in San Jose, California and in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and employ experienced staff in voice and data operations in US, UK, and Romania to provide 24-hour operations support, seven days per week. We use various tools to monitor and manage elements of our network and our partners' networks in real time. We also monitor the network elements of some of our larger business customers. Additionally, our network operations centers provide technical support to troubleshoot equipment and network problems. We also rely upon the network operations centers and resources of our telecommunications carrier partners and data center providers to augment our monitoring and response efforts. In the event of a major disruption at a data center, such as a natural disaster, failover between data centers for 8x8 Virtual Office is designed to occur almost instantly and with minimal disruption. In addition, most of the maintenance services performed by 8x8 do not interrupt the service we provide to customers. For example, we can move the core call flow processing from one data center to another without dropping a call. We offer local redundancy (i.e., failover to a data center within the same region) as a standard feature of 8x8 Virtual Contact Center, and geographical redundancy (i.e., failover to a data center in a different region) can be enabled as an option to provision geo-redundant tenants on multiple sites. Customer and Technical Support 8x8 maintains a global customer support organization with operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, Singapore, and Romania. Customers can access 8x8 customer support services directly from the company website, or receive multi-channel technical support via phone, chat, web and email. Emergency support is available on a 24x7 basis. We take a lifecycle approach to customer support, supporting customers from onboarding to deployment and training, and through the renewal process, to drive greater user adoption of 8x8 services. For our larger enterprise customers, our Elite Touch implementation methodology utilizes a Deployment Management team and provides active support through the "go-live" date at each customer site. We also have an Elite Customer Success Program, and, for a certain profile of customer, a dedicated Customer Success Manager, as a single point of contact for every aspect of the post-sale relationship. Finally, we offer a variety of training classes through our 8x8 Academy, either through instructor-led classes or self-paced eLearning. Interconnection Agreements We are a party to telecommunications interconnect and service agreements with VoIP providers and public switched telephone network (PSTN) telecommunications carriers in the United States and other global regions. Pursuant to these agreements, VoIP calls originating on our network can be terminated on other VoIP networks or the PSTN, and likewise, calls originating on other VoIP networks and the PSTN can be terminated on our network. Research and Development The cloud communications market is characterized by rapid technological changes and advancements, typical of most SaaS markets. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and services, as well as the development of enhancements and features to our existing products and services, and make these enhancements available to our customers frequently. Research and development expenses in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $34.8 million, $27.5 million, and $24.0 million, respectively.  8   We plan to invest in expanding the set of services within our platform, including extending our contact center capabilities, adding deeper collaboration services, and bringing an increasing number of analytics-driven applications to market. Our development programs continue to focus on the integration and functionality of our products and services with other SaaS products, such as Google's GSuite, Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Zendesk and others. We also plan to continue investing in our AI and ML research, to develop more intelligent features for our services. We currently employ individuals in research, development and engineering activities in our facilities in San Jose, California, London, England and Cluj, Romania as well as outsourced software development consultants. Regulatory Matters In the United States, VoIP and other software communications and collaboration services, like ours, have been subject to less regulation at the state and federal levels than traditional telecommunications services. The FCC has subjected VoIP service providers to a smaller subset of regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service providers and has not yet classified VoIP services as either telecommunications or information. The FCC is currently examining the status of VoIP service providers and the services they provide in multiple open proceedings. Many state regulatory agencies impose taxes and other surcharges on VoIP services, and certain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers are intrastate telecommunications services and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that federal regulations largely pre-empt state regulations that treat VoIP offerings in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. However, there are many areas of regulation where pre-emption has not been resolved as a matter of law. It is possible that the FCC could determine that VoIP services are not information services, or that there could be a judicial or legislative determination that the states are not pre-empted from regulating VoIP services as traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how or when these issues will be resolved or the potential future impact on our business at this time. In addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally. Internationally, we are subject to a complex patchwork of regulations that vary from country to country. Some countries have adopted laws that make the provision of VoIP services illegal within the country. Other countries have adopted laws that impose stringent licensing obligations on providers of VoIP services like ours. In many countries, it is not clear how laws that have historically been applied to traditional telecommunications providers will be applied to providers of VoIP services like us. On May 4, 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, and will replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR imposes new obligations on all companies, including us, and substantially increases potential liability for all companies, including us, for failure to comply with data protection rules.  The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders, or any changes in existing laws or their enforcement, on our operations cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers. An increase in these costs could make our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services, if we increase our prices, or decrease our profit margins, if we attempt to absorb such costs. Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," for a discussion of regulatory risks, proceedings and issues that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the future.  9  
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology in the United States and internationally. We currently rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. From inception through March 31, 2018 we have been awarded more than 150 United States patents, which we expect to expire between 2018 and 2035. We have additional patent applications pending. We cannot predict whether our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require our employees to sign agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and also the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competition will not independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around any of our patents. In addition, the laws of foreign countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information could cause our business and operating results to suffer. We are also subject to the risks of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Such claims and litigation could require us to expend substantial resources and distract key employees from their normal duties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The communications and software industries are subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the VoIP service provider community has historically been a target of patent holders. There is a risk that we will be a target of assertions of patent rights and that we may be required to expend significant resources to investigate and defend against such assertions of patent rights. For information about specific claims, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - "Our infringement of a third party's proprietary technology could disrupt our business" and Part I, Item 3. "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS." We utilize certain technology, including hardware and software, that we license from third parties. Most of these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses. To date, the cost and terms of these licenses individually has not been material to our business. There can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, however. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could harm our business. Geographic Areas We have two reportable segments. Financial information relating to revenues generated in different geographic areas are set forth in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Employees As of March 31, 2018, our workforce consisted of 1,225 full time employees spread across the globe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. Available Information We were incorporated in California in February 1987 and reincorporated in Delaware in December 1996. We maintain a corporate Internet website at the address http://www.8x8.com.
