ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Historical Development
 
America Great Health, formerly Crown Marketing, is a Wyoming corporation (the “Company”). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated December 2, 2013, the Company acquired all of the common stock of Okra Energy, Inc., a California corporation that was subscribed for on December 2, 2013 and then incorporated on December 18, 2013, in exchange for 16,155,746,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) at the closing of the Agreement on December 3, 2013. Immediately prior to the closing, there were approximately 3,825,275,800 shares of Common Stock outstanding. After the closing, the beneficial owner of Okra Energy, Inc. shareholder, Jay Hooper, owned approximately 98.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.  The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger (recapitalization) with Okra Energy, Inc. deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed to be the legal acquirer.     
 
Concurrently with the merger, Jay Hooper was appointed as the sole director and President of the Company.  
 
A change of control of the Company was completed on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper, the former officer and director of the Company and its former majority shareholder. Control was obtained by the sale of 16,155,746,000 shares of Company common stock from Mr. Hooper to an investor group led by Mike Q. Wang.  In connection with the change of control, the Company sold to its former majority shareholder one of its subsidiary for $100 and another subsidiary in exchange for the cancellation of all payables and accrued expenses.
 
On March 1, 2017, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming an Articles of Amendment to change the corporate name from Crown Marketing to America Great Health. Following the name change, the Company applied for a change of its stock ticker symbol from CWNM to AAGH. The application was approved by FINRA. Our stocks are now trading under the new ticker symbol AAGH.
 
On March 9, 2017, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, America Great Health, under the laws of the State of California.
 
Through December 31, 2016, the Company’s primary business activity was the sale of various consumer products and accessories. After December 31, 2016, the Company’s operations are determined and structured by the new investor group. As such, at June 30, 2017, the Company accounted for all of its assets, liabilities and results of operations up to January 1, 2017 as discontinued operations.
 
Our Business
 
Prior to the change of controlling ownership of the common stocks, the Company was in the business of selling consumer products. It acquired electronic products from manufactures and then sold them directly to consumers so as to be more competitive in price. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased operations in this line of business. The Company’s former Board Chairman and CEO, Mr. Jay Hooper, has adopted a strategy of growth through acquisition. The new management led by Mike Wang has continued the strategy of not only growing internally, but also by acquisition of growth companies which we believe will generate above-average returns on capital.
 
The Company will focus its business in the health related industry. The Company’s Chairman and president, Mike Wang, is the owner of several health related businesses below with which The Company is evaluating the possibilities of forming several joint ventures. The Company might effectuate the joint ventures using stocks.
 
 
1. | Health & Beauty Group Inc. It is a California company in the business of R &D and sale of vitamins and nutritional supplements. It owns more than 20 formulas and engages contract manufacturers to make these products. The company has built up solid sales records both in the US as well as in China.

The Company is also planning to conduct acquisition. Mike Wang has approached several health related companies in China and met the management of potential acquisition targets. Rapid economic advances in China in the last thirty years have greatly improved the living standards in China. This in turn brings demand in healthcare products and services. Company feels strongly that despite the challenges of cross border business, we might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to our stockholders.
 
As inherent with any new business development, there are risks involved in such endeavor. For all the healthcare related businesses afore-mentioned, the Company is evaluating what kind of risks we are facing. The Company notices that vitamin and nutrition supplement business is a highly competitive market and faces multiple regulatory monitoring. The compliance challenge is constant. Regarding proton treatment sales, the device is very expensive and for such large ticket item, the procurement process can be long and arduous. The sale of cardio vascular device also has its challenges. The device is not well known and the acceptance of the use requires major efforts in educating not only the medical professionals but also consumers. This would demand financial as well as other resources. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition efforts, any potential results, if any, are still not certain.
 
Employees and Outside Services
 
The Company’s only employee at the present time is its sole executive officer and director, who devotes full time to the affairs of the Company.  Remaining administrative (non-policy making) officers and consultants and technical personnel such as marketing specialists are being compensated as independent contractors.  We pay these persons on a contract basis as required.
