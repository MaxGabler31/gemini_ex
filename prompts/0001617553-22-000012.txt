Item 1. Business
Overview
The job market remains painfully inefficient. Job seekers are required to navigate on their own in order to find the right jobs to apply to, usually across multiple sites and without effective tools for monitoring new opportunities. Employers in turn are overwhelmed by the complexity of modern recruiting given the abundance of job boards, search engines, and social networks to source talent from. Neither side is an expert at their role. Neither side enjoys the process. 
ZipRecruiter is a two-sided marketplace for work that simplifies the job market for both job seekers and employers. Unlike traditional online job sites, ZipRecruiter works like a matchmaker curating job opportunities for job seekers, and candidates for employers.
Our Mission. To actively connect people to their next great opportunity. 
Creating Value for Job Seekers. For job seekers across all industries and levels of seniority, we operate like a dedicated recruiter. That means presenting strong fit job opportunities, proactively pitching potential candidates to employers and providing job seekers with updates on the status of their applications. This makes job seekers feel supported while searching for work. 
Creating Value for Employers. For employers, we focus on building technology to rapidly deliver quality candidates to companies of all sizes and across all industries. Our algorithms alert strong-fit job seekers in our marketplace when a job is posted. We also present high quality candidates to employers whom we believe will be a Great Match for their jobs, and allow these employers to invite those candidates to apply.
Unique Data and Artificial Intelligence Provide Better Outcomes for Employers and Job Seekers. With a relevant data pipeline created from billions of interactions between job seekers and employers, we are uniquely positioned to harness that data to fuel the advanced artificial intelligence behind our matching, recommendation and marketplace optimization capabilities. Through our deep learning-based natural language processing, we understand job seekers’ and employers’ nuanced needs. We model and analyze clicks, applications, hiring signals and numerous other interactions to improve outcomes for all participants in our marketplace. Our advanced technology stack processes the data generated by our highly engaged user base to continuously improve our matching.
Accelerating Network Effects. Increasing the number of jobs in our marketplace attracts more job seekers. A greater number of job seekers attracts more employers who in turn post more job opportunities in our marketplace. These natural, self-perpetuating network effects increase our data and thereby accelerate the rate at which our matching technology gets smarter over time.
Compelling Financial Results. The combination of the scale on both sides of our marketplace, our efficient go-to-market strategy and intelligent use of technology has resulted in compelling financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue was $418.1 million and we generated net income of $86.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenue was $741.1 million and we generated net income of $3.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $108.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of our management’s use of this measure, and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

What We Do
We enable work by connecting job seekers and employers in our marketplace. 
How We Work for Employers
Our technology delivers high-quality matches to our employers immediately after a job goes live and provides tools to streamline the candidate selection process. 
Quality Candidates Fast
•Job distribution. Jobs posted on ZipRecruiter are distributed to well over 1,000 sites managed by our Job Distribution Partners. Job Distribution Partners are third-party sites who have a relationship with us and advertise jobs from our marketplace, and include job boards, newspaper classifieds, search engines, social networks, talent communities and resume services. The diversity and depth of our partner network enables employers to reach an especially broad job seeker audience.
•Instant alerts to qualified potential candidates. When employers post a job, ZipRecruiter’s matching technology immediately identifies and sends an alert to strong-fit job seekers in our marketplace. 
•Direct recruitment messages from the employer. Immediately after a job is posted, ZipRecruiter’s matching technology presents the employer with a list of the best potential candidates in the market. The employer can then, with a single click, personally invite the most qualified potential candidates to apply. These recruitment messages directly from the employer drive the highest rated candidates ever delivered through ZipRecruiter. 
•Matching that learns. When an employer gives an applicant a “thumbs up” rating, our technology searches for other job seekers with similar profiles to that candidate and proactively encourages them to apply. Our matching will continue to improve over time as we collect more data and our technology applies the learnings embedded in the data.
•Access to an expansive database of job seekers. We provide employers the ability to search through our database of job seekers who have broad skill sets and a range of experiences.
Efficient Candidate Vetting
•All the applicants in one place. For employers who do not already have an established process to manage hiring, job applicants from all these different sites are captured inside the ZipRecruiter Applicant Tracking System, or ATS. Our ATS centralizes and simplifies the decision-making process. Inside this system, hiring teams can review, rate and ultimately decide which candidate to hire. For employers already using certain third-party ATSs, we seamlessly populate candidates into their existing workflow.
•Great Matches. Our technology labels candidates identified as a Great Match to help hiring managers avoid missing high quality candidates. 
•In-demand candidate alerts. We apply an “Act Fast!” label to notify employers when their candidates have received interest from other employers, encouraging them to reach out quickly. In a tight, competitive market for top-quality talent, these notifications prompt hiring managers to move quickly to avoid losing out on a potentially great hire.
Flexible Pricing
•Flexible pricing based on customer needs. We provide a variety of pricing plans to best suit an employer’s specific needs, including flat rate pricing on terms typically ranging from a day to a

year, as well as performance-based pricing for employers that run sophisticated recruitment marketing campaigns.
How We Work for Job Seekers
For job seekers, we make finding work easier. 
Process Efficiency
•Search millions of jobs in one place. ZipRecruiter provides job seekers with access to millions of jobs from all over the internet. Job seekers can filter this vast array of opportunities by using numerous criteria to find the handful of best potential matches on our website or in our mobile app.
•Simple, one-click applications. On ZipRecruiter, job seekers create a profile and can then apply for certain opportunities with a single click. Our one-click application works across both our marketplace and certain Job Distribution Partners to remove barriers between a job seeker and their next opportunity. This is particularly useful for job seekers on mobile devices where a resume can’t be easily created or uploaded.
•Job application tracking. Job seekers typically apply to numerous opportunities throughout the course of their search. Our simple, user-friendly dashboard aggregates their application history so job seekers can track opportunities they have reviewed or applied to.
Personalized Recruiter Assistance
•“Phil,” your personal (automated) recruiter. Our automated recruiter “Phil” welcomes job seekers to our marketplace and engages with them throughout their onboarding and job seeking journeys. Through Phil, job seekers are presented with curated opportunities for which they might be a Great Match. Phil provides positive, personalized messages to candidates, inviting them to apply for new open positions. Through repeated interaction throughout the ZipRecruiter job seeker experience, Phil learns about each job seeker and is able to deliver better matches and recommendations.
•Pitched to employers as a potential candidate. After a new job is posted, ZipRecruiter’s matching technology immediately presents strong-fit in-market job seekers to the employer for consideration. Employers can then directly invite the job seekers they like best to apply. Candidates receive inbound requests from interested employers before applying or even actively searching. While job seekers typically do not like the process of applying to jobs, the feeling of affirmation from being recruited to a particular job drives greater engagement. 
•Job alerts. ZipRecruiter delivers a digest of relevant new opportunities from across the web on a daily basis, enabling job seekers to monitor the full breadth of our marketplace offerings. 
•Application updates. Our technology notifies job seekers when an employer either views their application or gives them a “thumbs up” rating. This addresses the #1 complaint we hear from job seekers: applying to a job and then hearing nothing back.

Our Strengths
Our core competitive advantages that have been critical to our success include:
•Large and unique set of jobs. Our technology brings jobs listed directly in our marketplace as well as those from our Job Acquisition Partners together. Job Acquisition Partners are third-party sites and ATSs who have a relationship with us and from whom we receive jobs for our marketplace. ZipRecruiter was the original source for millions of these jobs in 2021, which means a job seeker’s search is incomplete unless they access our marketplace.
•Engaged job seeker community. Over 35 million Active Job Seekers1 engaged in the ZipRecruiter marketplace in 2021. Those job seekers come to us directly and through our network of well over 1,000 sites managed by our Job Distribution Partners.
•Powerful artificial intelligence powered technology. Our technology captures insights from billions of user interactions facilitated by our marketplace, driving meaningful increases in the quality of matches we can enable over time. We do this by leveraging our software to ingest and analyze candidate behavior, including resume data, searches, and certifications, to find the most relevant jobs for each candidate on the ZipRecruiter network. 
•Designed for simplicity and speed. We thrive on taking unnecessarily complex processes and simplifying them. This product design philosophy permeates our entire company. We focus on continually making ZipRecruiter faster and simpler for employers and job seekers to use.
•Metrics-driven culture. We are a metrics and data-driven company. We are disciplined about setting quantitative operating goals and then finding innovative ways to achieve those goals.
•Powerful network effects. The scale of matching activity in our marketplace provides us with a unique and growing data set consisting of billions of signals which help drive superior matching. More jobs, more job seekers and better matching technology over time create more high-velocity hiring activity in our marketplace, fueling a self-perpetuating cycle of network effects.
•Our brand. Since our founding, we have invested to build the ZipRecruiter brand to over 80% aided brand awareness among U.S. employers.
Our Competition
Hiring is a vast, competitive, and highly fragmented market. We compete in varying degrees with other online job sites including CareerBuilder, Craigslist, Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster and hundreds of others.
Competition for Employers
Employers have a range of options when posting job opportunities. We compete to attract and retain employers to advertise their jobs in our marketplace. We compete for employers based on several factors including the pricing and features of our offerings, the speed of receiving great candidates, the size of our job seeker community, the simplicity of our user experience, and our trusted brand. We believe that our employers are able to cost-effectively attract the right job seekers in our marketplace compared to other online recruiting sites due to the combination of the strength of our job seeker community and our proven matching technology that continues to get smarter over time.
1 “Active Job Seeker” means a job seeker who, within a specified period, takes one or more of the following actions: (1) makes at least one visit to a ZipRecruiter-hosted site, (2) launches a ZipRecruiter job seeker iOS mobile application, or (3) opens a ZipRecruiter-hosted engagement email. For purposes of counting Active Job Seekers, we count only unique users who are registered with ZipRecruiter as jobseekers and who have previously visited a ZipRecruiter-hosted site at least once. Activity by users not registered with ZipRecruiter, registered users who are logged out of their job seeker account, or users who have opened an email alert generated by sign-ups with a ZipRecruiter partner will not contribute toward the Active Job Seeker metric.

Competition for Job Seekers 
Job seekers have a variety of choices when searching for their next great job opportunity. We compete for job seekers on many fronts, including our ability to surface unique and attractive jobs, our ability to simplify the search process, the transparent feedback job seekers receive on the status of their applications, and our trusted brand. Our marketplace is free to job seekers. We believe our offering to job seekers compares favorably to alternatives due to the combination of our large and unique pool of job opportunities, and the personalized job seeker experience facilitated by our AI-powered personal recruiter named Phil.
Our Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,150 individuals across the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel. We also engage independent contractors and consultants. We have efficiently operated and adapted as a remote workforce since the beginning of 2020; however, we maintain office spaces for in-person work in Santa Monica, California, Phoenix, Arizona and Tel Aviv, Israel. Collectively, we view the team at ZipRecruiter as our greatest asset, and we take great pride in having been recognized by companies such as Comparably and Built In for various awards including “Best Company Culture” and “Best Place to Work,” to name a few.
Several aspects of how we operate our business have been critical to building our team: 
•We use ZipRecruiter. We utilize the power of the marketplace we have built to connect to our next great employees.
•We foster an entrepreneurial culture of safety and innovation. We believe a safe, professional environment empowers people to take risks and be their best selves. Our employees are encouraged to champion great ideas, embrace innovative approaches and use data to advocate for their point of view.
•We embrace diversity & inclusion, or D&I: We believe our company is strengthened by a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. Our employee-led and executive-sponsored Diversity & Inclusion Council drives initiatives around training, recruiting, people analytics and our highly-active Employee Resource Groups. Our commitment to D&I is aligned with our mission to actively connect people from all backgrounds to their next opportunity.
•We reward high performance. We focus on attracting and retaining results-oriented employees who are passionate about our mission. We use a variety of compensation tools to recruit, retain and reward employees whose achievements exceed our high expectations.
•We are committed to our employees’ career development. We invest in our people so that ZipRecruiter is not just a great place to work, but also a great place to advance and grow a rewarding career. In 2021, we increased our investment in leadership development programs and other learning initiatives.
Our Technology
Our research and development efforts are focused on delivering great products through data driven systems, machine learning technology, and robust infrastructure to ensure that our marketplace is sophisticated, low latency, resilient, and available to our users at all times.
Our research and development organization is built around small, cross functional development teams, arranged in larger divisions. These development teams foster greater agility, which enables us to develop new, innovative product features as well as iterate quickly on new capabilities and optimizations. Our development teams design, build and continue to expand our ATS, mobile apps, data processing and analysis pipelines, marketplace functionality, search and matching, email and messaging, and third-party product integrations as well as the software infrastructure that supports best practices such as high

frequency deployment, orchestrating containers, and leveraging open-source technologies. Our systems are currently operated entirely on cloud services. 
We have engineers, product managers and data scientists, primarily located in Santa Monica, California and Tel Aviv, Israel. We intend to continue to invest in our technology capabilities as we further build out a category-defining marketplace for job seekers and employers.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm or require us to change our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of consumer, customer and employee personal information. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of data (such as personal data, “special categories of personal data” or health data), and/or impose specific requirements relating to the collection or processing of such data. 
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Department of Commerce, and various states continue to call for greater regulation of the collection of personal data, as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices. Section 5(a) of the FTC Act empowers the agency to enforce against “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,” and the FTC has used this authority extensively to hold businesses to fair and transparent privacy and security standards. Numerous states have also enacted or are proposing legislation to enact state-level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents’ personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, came into force in California in 2020. The CCPA established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, created new privacy rights for consumers residing in the state, and required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or CPRA, which further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements and rights of California consumers effective January 1, 2023, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. Virginia and Colorado each have enacted a new privacy law that creates new privacy rights for consumers residing in those states and new obligations for businesses operating in those states, including obligations relating to data minimization, processing of sensitive information, and targeted advertising practices. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act take effect January 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023, respectively.
In Canada, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, sets forth ten principles that are designed to protect the personal information of individuals in Canada, and places obligations on companies that process personal information. PIPEDA applies to organizations that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities, where such activities take place within a Canadian province that does not otherwise have “substantially similar” legislation. Alberta, British Columbia and Québec are the only provinces that have enacted comprehensive private sector privacy statutes that have each been deemed “substantially similar” to PIPEDA. As such, PIPEDA will not apply to commercial organizations operating within Alberta, British

Columbia and Québec, although the data protection obligations throughout Canada are substantially the same. 
In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to create a single legal framework in relation to the collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual that applies across all EU member states. However, the GDPR allows for derogations where EU member states can deviate from the requirements in their own legislation, including for example, introducing measures that apply in specific situations and implementing rules regarding legal basis of processing. It is therefore likely that we will need to comply with these local regulations in addition to the GDPR, where we operate or provide services in those EU member state jurisdictions. Local supervisory authorities are able to impose fines for non-compliance and have the power to carry out audits, require companies to cease or change processing, request information, and obtain access to premises. The GDPR created more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, granting new rights for data subjects as well as enhancing existing rights, requiring enhanced disclosures to data subjects about how personal data is processed (including information about the profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making), records of processing activities, limiting retention periods of personal data, requiring mandatory data breach notification to data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, to the affected individuals), and requiring additional policies and procedures to comply with the accountability principle under the GDPR. 
In the United Kingdom, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, is the UK’s implementation of the GDPR, which also became effective on May 25, 2018. However, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered a transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020. As a result of Brexit, we now have compliance obligations under the EU’s GDPR and the UK’s GDPR. The European Commission adopted a decision on the UK’s adequacy under the GDPR in June 2021, meaning that that most data can continue to flow from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the UK without the need for additional safeguards. 
In any event, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in the EEA and the UK have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal information from the EEA and the UK to “third countries,” especially the United States. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (a mechanism for the transfer of personal information from the EEA to the United States). The CJEU also made clear that reliance on standard contractual clauses (another mechanism for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA) alone may not be sufficient in all circumstances. We currently rely on standard contractual clauses and these changes, coupled with additional enforcement on data transfers by EU data protection authorities, are therefore continuing to require us to review and update our current compliance approach (including review of new and existing data processors and subprocessors), and may result in additional compliance costs or the inability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA and/or the United Kingdom.
We are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. In the EU and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the digital advertising ecosystem. In addition, the current national laws that implement the e-Privacy Directive are highly likely to be replaced by an EU regulation known as the e-Privacy Regulation, which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance. The text of the e-Privacy Regulation is still under development, and recent EU regulatory guidance and court decisions have created uncertainty about the level to which such laws and regulations will be enforced, which may require us to review our compliance approach and increase compliance costs. Informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. 
Table of Contents

Similarly, other jurisdictions are instituting privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, or may do so in the future, which could increase our risk and compliance costs.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned three U.S. and 20 international trademark registrations for the mark ZIPRECRUITER. We also own one pending trademark application, and numerous domain names, including www.ziprecruiter.com.
We rely primarily on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, third parties, and others who may have access to our proprietary information. We also require employees to sign invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment, and strictly control access to our proprietary technology.
