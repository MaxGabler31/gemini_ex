General description of our activity
 
Currently, the main activity of Crona Corp. is providing music-recognition services.
 
Crona Corp. is developing a personal assistant program that would easily identify favorite music tracks. Due to unique algorithms of music recognition, users can expand their media library much faster. Such an effective functionality would be achieved by a simple principle of the program. A user needs to push the search button. Then, the program analyzes a music fragment. After successful recognition, data about the music track is displayed on the screen.
 
A convenient interface gives an opportunity to play favorite tracks quickly and efficiently. Integration with the music streaming services would allow to create playlists and add them to the media library just in a few clicks. All recent tracks are saved so the users can always find them later again. As a result, there would be an option to read lyrics and share a track with others.
 
For better program exploitation, AI would be used. It will recommend tracks based on usersâ€™ preferences and search results. This function will become a unique feature of our mobile application.
 
We expect AppStore and Google Play to be the major platforms for our program to be submitted. Also, this information would be posted to our website corpcrona.com and would be an effective advertisement instrument for program promotion.
