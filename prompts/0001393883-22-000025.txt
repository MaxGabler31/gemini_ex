2021 Highlights | 2021 marked the formal inflection point in the multi-year effort to return DHI to meaningful growth with revenue increasing for the first time since 2012. Having laid the foundation for the Company’s turnaround through a renewed commitment to innovation and to building a high performing sales and marketing team, DHI's primary goals for 2021 were to further establish its brands as leaders in the marketplace and to deliver innovative services to help employers attract technology professionals in a challenging recruiting market and to help technologists advance their careers. DHI's investments in sales and marketing, supported by a dramatically improved Dice product, drove growth in bookings and revenue while ClearanceJobs continued delivery of features that enhanced its status as the leading career marketplace for cleared professionals. The company increased its investments in both product development and sales and marketing, while maintaining its historically strong EBITDA margins. Additionally, as the pandemic continued, there was no breakdown in workforce productivity and employees became further engaged in the organization. Key results include: 
Establish Dice and ClearanceJobs as the preferred career specialists | Dice Marketplace launched during the first quarter as a comprehensive and flexible platform through which recruiters and candidates can rapidly and confidently search, match and communicate in real-time. The three major components of the marketplace are recruiter profiles, an enhanced candidate profile that focuses deeply on exposing tech skills, and in-platform instant messaging. Dice also furthered its value to clients and commitment to an inclusive recruiting experience by launching Unbiased Sourcing mode for TalentSearch, mitigating unconscious bias and anonymizing candidate information associated with bias. A testament to Dice’s differentiation from competitors, the TalentSearch skills matching algorithms are patent pending. ClearanceJobs further cemented its position as a leader in the security cleared recruitment market, solving challenges for recruiter workflow by launching CJ Team Recruiting, enabling recruitment teams to combine candidate pipelines and tag candidates to signal action from other recruiters on the team; and CJ Meetings, which allows recruiters and candidates to synchronize their Google or Outlook calendars to efficiently schedule telephone calls, video calls, or in-platform chats. Additionally, ClearanceJobs launched CJ Video, giving recruiters and candidates the ability to deliver video messages, integrate videos into profiles and perform group broadcasts, all of which are streamed and hosted in-platform.
Best-in-class sales & marketing engine | The success of our new business sales teams manifested in growing our client base. Client counts for Dice and ClearanceJobs exceed prior years, growing 17% and 9% year-over-year respectively.Dice exceeded its targets for delivering marketing qualified leads to its three new business teams, a significant contributor to increased booking results.Dice marketing launched a brand awareness campaign for the first time in years, delivering over 190 million impressions and driving increased traffic to Dice.com. In the fourth quarter, DHI’s overall revenue growth was 25% year-over-year.ClearanceJobs maintained over $1 million in annual recurring revenue from government contracts, a large whitespace opportunity for the brand. 
Return to Growth | Clients continue to find value in DHI services, with revenue renewal rates at 87% for Dice and 96% for ClearanceJobs in 2021.Bookings strengthened throughout the year across all sales units, growing to $133.4 million to end 2021, a 35% increase, indicating momentum for revenue growth heading into 2022.The Company maintained a strong EBITDA margin of 22% while continuing to make strategic investments to maximize growth opportunities.

Company Profile
DHI was incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2005 and is a leading provider of artificial intelligence-powered software products, online tools and services to deliver career marketplaces to candidates and employers globally. DHI's brands — Dice and ClearanceJobs (the Company transferred majority ownership of the eFinancialCareers ("eFC") brand and business to eFC management on June 30, 2021) — enable recruiters and hiring managers to efficiently search, match and connect with highly skilled technologists in specialized fields, particularly technology and those with active government security clearances. Our mission is to empower technology professionals and organizations that hire them to compete and win through expert insights and relevant employment connections by delivering three key value propositions:
•Providing the best search and match solution for recruiters and employers through software services; 
•Delivering the most relevant and personalized technology career related content; and
•Aggregating and analyzing workforce intelligence data to deliver specialized insights.
The majority of our revenues today are generated through the sale of recruitment packages, which allow customers to promote jobs on our websites and source candidates through our resume databases. Recruitment packages are typically provided through contractual arrangements with annual, quarterly or monthly payment terms.
Our Products and Services
We help organizations find the best talent, and we help technology and security cleared professionals find the best jobs to advance their careers. Through our software solutions, our vision is to create indispensable career marketplaces that match the highest quality candidates with the right career opportunities. Our solutions are available individually or bundled in packages, including:
•Talent profiles. Each of our brands provides access to relevant candidate profiles, resumes, and social and web profiles creating a broader pool of talent for our clients. We help clients quickly find and connect with top talent to make their recruiting efforts more efficient.
•Job postings. Our job platforms are focused on specific verticals tailored to technology and security-cleared individuals, making it easier for professionals to search for relevant jobs. In turn, the applications received by clients are more likely to be relevant and qualified compared to applications received on generalist sites. Providing professionals with the most relevant job postings benefits both the talent and the recruiting organization.
•Employer Branding. Each of our brands has a suite of offerings that help clients amplify their brand to reach more professionals. Solutions include display advertising, email, enhanced job postings or company profiles, and social targeting.
•Managed Services. This premium service delivers sourced and screened candidates to recruiters and employers.
•Content and data. Each of our brands provides tailored content to help professionals manage their careers and provide employers insight into recruiting strategies and trends.

Dice had approximately 79,000 job postings as of December 31, 2021 and during 2021, Dice had, on average, approximately 1.3 million monthly users.
Table of Contents

Customers can purchase recruitment packages, job postings or advertisements. Recruitment packages offer our customers the ability to access candidate profiles and post up to a specified number of jobs. Candidate Match and Search on Dice is powered by IntelliSearch, a proprietary machine-learning technology that is foundational to many Dice products and services. Approximately 90% of Dice revenue was derived from recruitment packages in 2021.
Professionals can post their resumes, search jobs and access our career-related content, news and tools. Skill Center, a tool implemented by Dice, uses data aggregated from across the web to show skills trends, giving professionals insights into potential skills gaps and development areas. Salary Predictor and Salary Calculator offer real-time salary tools leveraging predictive analysis to help tech professionals and employers discover tailored salary estimates based on skills, job titles, years of experience and location. Job Search and Job Alerts deliver tailored and personalized career opportunities to candidates. 
ClearanceJobs is a leading online career marketplace dedicated to matching security-cleared professionals with the best hiring companies searching for employees. Authorized U.S. government contractors, federal agencies, national laboratories and universities utilize The Cleared Network to quickly and easily find candidates with specific, active security clearance requirements to fill open jobs in a range of disciplines. ClearanceJobs NextGen platform provides opportunities for employers and candidates to engage in real-time through messaging and employers to promote brand differentiators through BrandAmp and Pulse. The majority of candidates with resumes on our site have high-level security clearance. ClearanceJobs had approximately 60,000 job postings as of December 31, 2021 and during 2021, ClearanceJobs had, on average, 616,000 monthly users.

The eFC business is one of the world’s leading financial services careers websites, operating websites in multiple markets in four languages mainly across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and North America. Professionals from across many sectors of the financial services industry, including asset management, risk management, investment banking, and information technology, use eFinancialCareers to advance their careers. Employers can engage with financial services professionals through real-time messaging and promote their employment brand through Recruiter Profiles. 
Our Industry 
We primarily operate in the talent discovery and acquisition segment of the broader market for human capital management services through career sites for technology professionals. There is a shortage of skilled professionals worldwide and we believe that the overall demand for talent acquisition and career development products and services has significant long-term growth potential. 
We also believe that certain industries that employ highly-skilled and highly-paid professionals will experience particularly strong demand for effective recruiting solutions due to the scarcity of such professionals. For example, as of December 2021, the seasonally unadjusted U.S. unemployment rate was 2.0% for computer-related occupations as compared to the overall national average of 3.9%, seasonally adjusted. We believe that there are four major trends that will continue to shape demand for talent acquisition services:
•Greater competition for professional talent. The candidate-employer relationship has changed, with the balance of power shifting towards the candidates. As more companies leverage technology to advance their business, employers will increasingly need to hire tech talent to compete. According to analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and CBRE Research, high tech jobs and creative industries are significant drivers to economic expansion.
•Continued professional interest in career brands specific to industry and skills. Our services focus on domains or industries that require specialized skills and knowledge and, thus, customized content, profiles and search parameters. In addition, the technology professionals often share a sense of personal identity and community that goes beyond the confines of their careers. We believe that both specialized skills and the sense of personal identity and community lead professionals in our verticals to prefer specialized career brands over generalist ones. 
•Talent attraction and retention becoming more of a strategic priority for companies. The PWC 24th Annual Global CEO Survey found that 28% of CEOs in North America are 'extremely concerned' about the availability of key skills as a threat to their organizations’ growth prospects and 49% of CEOs plan increases of 10% or more in their long term investment in digital transformation. Hiring skilled technologists is a key driver to moving digital innovation forward. 
•Increased use of data and analytics in human capital management and increased need for insights. As many companies prove the power of analytics in marketing and other business domains, organizations are seeking to gain a competitive advantage by applying data-driven insights to improve their hiring, retention and leadership capabilities. 
Table of Contents

In this environment, we believe there is an opportunity for career management and talent acquisition tools that leverage the common interests, goals and skills of select professional communities. We believe that a focus on professional communities allows organizations to more efficiently identify talent, with more complete data and insights about that talent.
Our Value Proposition
We are a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through specialized online professional communities organized around common professional interests and skill sets powered by technology. This specialized approach provides technology professionals with more relevant career related information and opportunities, enhancing their ability to maximize their careers. Through engaging with professionals, we are able to build rich and unique data sets around valuable talent pools. The combination of our focused online professional websites and rich data sets allows organizations to find and hire professional talent more efficiently and effectively, and therefore incentivizes them to source talent through our online professional communities. The benefits our services provided to both professionals and recruiting customers create a robust marketplace.
Benefits we provide to Professionals
Relevant employment connections. When professionals post their resumes or apply for jobs on our websites, they can make valuable connections with organizations who prize their skills and expertise. Professionals can avoid having to “sort through the clutter” on generalist career sites and get the most out of their time by using our more focused services. 
Skills/industry-specific career management tools, information and insights. We provide professionals with targeted and relevant career development tools, content and news. For example, Dice and ClearanceJobs provide professionals with market and salary information and local market trends. In addition, the Salary Predictor allows professionals to evaluate their market value and map out which skills will increase their value. We believe our career development services and tools provide professionals with the insights they need to propel their careers forward, and thus increase the engagement of professionals with our sites.
Benefits we provide to our Customers
Large pools of qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. We seek to improve the efficiency of the recruiting process for our customers by providing efficient access to large pools of highly qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. Because the communities of professionals who visit our websites are highly-skilled and specialized within specific industries, we believe our customers who post jobs receive applications from candidates who are better qualified for the positions, and that they receive fewer irrelevant applications than when using generalist sites. In addition, since our resume data and resume search functions are highly tailored by specialty, we believe that our customers can more efficiently identify talent using our resume databases than by using broader services.
Relevant information on prospective candidates. We believe that the specialized nature of our job posting and resume search products makes them inherently more relevant and efficient for recruiting. Using all of these products together gives our customers the most complete view of a prospective candidate, and allows them to not only identify the best talent but also tailor their recruiting approach to each individual.
Hyper-targeted candidate outreach and employer branding. We offer recruiting customers the ability to target hard-to-find professionals with messages in the online forums they frequent. Our social targeting service leverages our social aggregation capabilities to assemble candidate target lists based on specific factors like skill sets, work experience, location, or interests; then executes hyper-targeted employer branding or job search campaigns in online forums where specific potential candidates spend time.

Our Strategic Goals
Since arriving in April of 2018, CEO Art Zeile has led an aggressive effort to focus and build on our legacy of market leadership in technology talent acquisition and reinvigorate the business in multiple respects, including delivering best-in-class candidate quality and match capabilities; transforming Dice from its job board legacy into an indispensable career marketplace modeled on our market-leading and high growth brand, ClearanceJobs; investing in functional excellence to drive growth and product innovation; and transforming/expanding our sales team to drive renewed growth.
Table of Contents

Delivering best-in-class candidate quality and match capabilities for technology roles. We believe candidate quality is the essential foundation of success in our industry and we intend to differentiate our business by leading in this respect. In 2021, we dramatically improved the quality of our Dice candidates to a level we believe is best-in-class and plan continued vigilance and innovation to drive continued improvements. We are also building on our unique legacy and intellectual property in the technology jobs space to create match capabilities for both candidates and clients that are reducing the time and effort required in job searching and talent acquisition. Our proprietary and patent-pending machine-learning technology including IntelliSearch, powers many Dice and ClearanceJobs products and is foundational to providing relevant job opportunities for candidates and efficient search and match solutions for clients. 
Building indispensable tech-focused career marketplaces. ClearanceJobs has established a unique franchise in the market for cleared professionals, many with tech experience. Built on a unique cohort of candidates and specialized employer and recruiter tools together, ClearanceJobs is a highly interactive two-sided marketplace environment. These attributes provide clear and measurable ROI for clients and has contributed to ClearanceJobs more than doubling its revenue over the past five years. With nearly 20 years in the market, we believe ClearanceJobs is a highly defensible and valuable business. We are in the process of transforming our Dice brand into a similar career marketplace customized for the needs of its unique candidate and client communities. We officially launched all elements of the career marketplace features for Dice in 2021, focusing on landing launches and driving adoption with customers. We expect these changes to transform the way our stakeholders use Dice and to drive results as adoption increases.
Investing in functional excellence and product innovation. Since joining DHI, CEO Art Zeile has built a leadership team capable of driving growth and supporting a culture of high performance. The leadership team continually advances their functional areas to drive results in the business, working towards the common goal of launching and landing innovative products in the market. Specifically, in 2021 the Company released a number of products to help employers find tech candidates and technologists further their careers. These include, at Dice: the Marketplace, Unbiased Sourcing Mode, TalentSearch Personalization, Brand.io and TalentSearch Social Data Refresh; at ClearanceJobs: Shared Talent Pipelines, Team Recruiting, Meetings and Video.
We are investing to further increase the pace of innovation by adding engineers to our technology team, centered around a development model to increase the quality and speed of product delivery. Our marketing team is focused on delivering results at lower cost in terms of driving traffic to Dice, increasing marketing qualified leads, growing visible profiles and applications with less spend and with more to come as we leverage new capabilities in customer relationship management (CRM), product marketing, and digital analytics, among others.
Transforming our sales and customer success efforts to drive growth.  As early leaders in online talent acquisition, DHI’s brands have a legacy of strong recurring clients and revenue and, as a result, renewals have historically provided the majority of the Company’s revenues. We believe there is significant opportunity to grow our customer base and expand to new revenue opportunities, particularly with commercial accounts, or clients who recruit for their own needs, with an expanded and better enabled sales force and at ClearanceJobs by growing relationships directly with government agencies. Our customer success team executed new strategies to drive proactive external engagement and report real-time feedback to better include the customer voice to influence our product roadmap. We will continue to grow our sales team as opportunities arise.
Marketing and Sales
We focus our long-term consumer marketing efforts on growing the number of professionals who visit and engage with our websites, which we believe increases the attractiveness of our websites to our customers. We use a combination of direct marketing, branding and communications initiatives, including content, to increase our brand awareness, traffic, new and updated profiles and applications to job postings. We primarily engage in digital media including search engine marketing, online advertising, social media, email and content marketing. Many of our brands use strategic alliances with relevant publishers, trade associations and industry groups to increase reach and traffic. Some of our brands have also invested in broader awareness campaigns through digital media and partnerships. 
Our customer marketing efforts are primarily focused on lead generation activities, such as digital media, email campaigns and participation in industry events. We use marketing communications, such as media relations, social media, and thought leadership content, to enhance brand awareness and client relationships. Many of our ongoing customer marketing efforts focus on driving increased customer understanding of our product innovation and tools to drive increased product usage. 
Table of Contents

We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by brand, market segment, and geography. Our field sales groups target Fortune 1000 companies, large staffing and recruiting firms and other large and mid-size businesses. Our strategy in 2021 focused on refining recently implemented sales processes, methodologies, and forecasting to drive improvements to better address market opportunities and our clients' needs. We increased our focus on customer success to drive renewal rates with existing customers and implemented an auto-renewal policy which resulted in uninterrupted access to our services for clients. Our in-house sales teams focus on generating new business from recruiters as well as small and mid-size companies, renewing customer contracts, increasing the service levels customers’ purchase and servicing the needs of our largest clients. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 119 sales personnel in the United States. In addition to our internal sales organization, we also use ad networks to help generate ad sales. 
We also invest in fraud detection initiatives and maintain teams of account managers and customer support specialists who work to ensure customers get the most from our products and services by providing training and assistance. In addition to technologies we leverage for fraud detection, our customer support departments perform some compliance functions, such as reviewing the websites for false or inaccurate job postings.
Customers
We currently serve a diversified customer base consisting of approximately 9,400 customers in total. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2021. Our customers include small, mid-sized and large direct employers, staffing companies, recruiting agencies, consulting firms and marketing departments of companies. As of December 31, 2021 notable customers of the Dice and ClearanceJobs businesses included AT&T, Adecco, Amazon, Cisco, Oracle, Kforce, ManTech, Microsoft, NCI, 7-Eleven , Samsung, Bank of America and DISH Network.
Technology
We use a variety of open source and proprietary technologies to support our website services. Our websites provide a multitenancy technology platform with multiple application services developed to perform at scale. We primarily utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud infrastructure platform, which enables us to scale our compute, network, and storage capacity on an as-needed basis. Our application services and data connections are continually monitored 24/7 for performance and stability. Our application and infrastructure architecture enable us to ensure global reach, as well as advantages in resiliency and cloud delivery. Job seekers and customers can access our websites with any standard web browser, mobile web browsers, and iOS and Android applications. Our websites also utilize AWS disaster recovery, redundancy, and resiliency services, including multi-availability zone, multi-region, redundant storage and networking solutions, and self-healing capabilities.
Competition
The market for talent acquisition services is highly competitive with multiple online and offline competitors. With the evolution of the online recruiting model, there has been an increasing need to provide ease-of-use and relevance to professionals, as well as an efficient and cost-effective recruitment method for direct employers, recruiters and staffing companies. Additionally, further technological advancements and evolution of social networks increasing the interaction between candidates and potential employers have made it easier for new competitors to emerge, and advertisers have many alternatives available to reach their target audiences. Our ability to maintain our existing customer base and generate new customers depends to a significant degree on the quality of our candidate databases and audiences, the quality of our services, our ability to enhance our websites and the underlying technology of our websites to meet the needs of a rapidly-evolving marketplace, our pricing strategy and ability to introduce value-added products and services, contracting alternatives such as subscription or consumption based models, and our reputation among our candidates and our customers and potential customers, who are increasingly sophisticated and demanding. Our competitors include: 

•social and professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Google;
•niche or specialist professional networking sites such as GitHub and Stack Overflow;
•generalist job boards, some of which have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do, such as CareerBuilder, Monster, StepStone, and Seek which, unlike specialized job boards, permit customers to enter into a single contract to find professionals across multiple occupational categories and attempt to fill all of their hiring needs through a single website;
Table of Contents

•aggregators and distributors of job postings and profiles, including Indeed (owned by Recruit), TalentBin (owned by Monster Worldwide), Entelo, ZipRecruiter, Google and Craigslist;
•career-focused community sites such as Glassdoor;
•newspaper and magazine publishers, national and regional advertising agencies, executive search firms and search and selection firms that carry classified advertising, many of whom have developed, begun developing or acquired new media capabilities, such as recruitment websites, or have partnered with generalist job boards;
•specialized services focused specifically on the industries we service, such as FT.com, Doximity, Upwork and JobServe;
•new and emerging competitors with new business models and products;
•our customers, who seek to recruit candidates directly by using their own resources, including corporate websites; and
•general business sites and print publications, as well as technology news and information community sites, such as Google News, Digg.com and Reddit.com. 
Intellectual Property 
We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of service marks, trademarks, copyrights and other methods of restricting disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information. As we continue to develop and improve our technology, patents may become a more significant part of our intellectual property in the foreseeable future. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and vendors. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
We generally pursue the registration of the material service marks we own in the United States and internationally, as applicable. We own a number of registered, applied for and/or unregistered trademarks and service marks that we use in connection with our businesses. Our trademarks and registered trademarks in the United States and other countries include DICE, and CLEARANCEJOBS.COM. Registrations for trademarks may be maintained indefinitely, as long as the trademark owner continues to use and police the trademarks and timely renews registrations with the applicable governmental office. Although we generally pursue the registration of our material service marks and other material intellectual property we own, where applicable, we have trademarks and/or service marks that have not been registered in the United States and/or other jurisdictions. We have not registered the copyrights in the content of our websites and do not intend to register such copyrights.
The steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and affect our competitive position. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Misappropriation or misuse of our intellectual property could harm our reputation, affect our competitive position and cost us money.”
Investments 
DHI has made no significant investments through acquisitions during the past five years. See also note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Regulation and Legislation
User Privacy
We collect, store and use a variety of information about both professionals and customers on our website properties. Within the websites, the information that is collected, stored, and used has been provided by the professionals or customers with the intent of making it publicly available. We do not ask professionals or customers to supply social security numbers. Our business data is separated from website operations by a variety of security layers including network segmentation, physical and logical access controls, firewalls, and many industry-accepted, best-practice information security controls.
We post our privacy policies on our websites so that our users can access and understand the terms and conditions applicable to the collection, storage, and use of information collected from users. Our privacy policies also disclose the types of information we gather, how we use it and how a user can correct or change their information. Our privacy policies also explain the circumstances under which we share this information and with whom. Professionals who register for our websites have the option of indicating specific areas of interest in which they are willing to receive offers via email or postal mail. These offers contain content created either by us or our third-party partners.
Table of Contents

To protect confidential information and to comply with our obligations to our users, we impose constraints on our customers to whom we provide user data, which are consistent with our commitments to our users. Additionally, when we provide lists to third parties, including to our advertiser customers, it is under contractual terms that are consistent with our obligations to our users and with applicable laws and regulations.
U.S. Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of government regulations that regulate our products and online service offerings, including content, copyright infringement, user privacy, advertising and promotional activities, taxation, access charges, liability for third-party activities, and jurisdiction. In addition, federal, state, and local governmental organizations have enacted and also are considering, and may consider in the future, other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet. Areas of potential regulation include, but are not limited to, libel, electronic contracting, pricing, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership.
There are a number of U.S. laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online. Certain laws regulate commercial electronic messages. Such laws frequently provide a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establish penalties for the sending of email messages that are not compliant with such laws, including messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content or that do not provide an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipient’s decision not to receive further commercial emails.
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies and terms of use agreements describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or terms of use agreements, or privacy-related laws and regulations, could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. The interpretation of these privacy and data protection laws and various regulators’ approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, continue to evolve over time. We face the risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways in different jurisdictions or in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new and unclear laws will be enacted. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory bodies. There are laws as well as a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that impose obligations in areas affecting our business, or may do so in the future. For example, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been characterized as the first privacy statute of its kind to be enacted in the United States as it includes significant penalties for non-compliance, as well as creating the right for consumers to bring a private action in certain circumstances. More recently, on November 3, 2020, California enacted the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). The CPRA, which goes into effect on January 1, 2023, expands upon the protections provided by the CCPA, including new limitations on the sale or sharing of consumers’ personal information, and the creation of a new state agency to enforce the CPRA’s protections.
Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our products and services and, ultimately, in a loss of customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, and could subject the Company to penalties or liability.
Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including, for example, in the United States where the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise negatively affect our business.

We offer flexible work schedules, abbreviated hours on Fridays, flexible paid time off and remote working opportunities for all team members to promote work/life balance. In 2021, we introduced a free mental health app for all employees and closed offices for two working days to allow employees to focus on their mental health.

Additionally the Company has a tuition reimbursement program designed to provide employees with financial assistance in continuing their education. 
Diversity
Inclusion and diversity remain key priorities for the Company. The diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences of executive officers, board members, and employees are important to both our values and performance. We believe that a diverse board, management team and workforce that is reflective of our diverse customer base will position us to better understand customers’ wants and needs, which we believe drives our ability to deliver superior customer value and successfully innovate. Diverse perspectives amongst our management team and board allows them to evaluate issues through different experiences and perspectives and help guide the Company in a thoughtful way. The Company’s internal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program is based on promoting a culture of inclusivity, and includes Allyship training and Unconscious Bias training, which teaches team members how to better support marginalized groups. Additionally, managers participate in Inclusive Leadership trainings. The Company has employee resource groups led by employees of underrepresented populations to share experiences and have a shared space. The internal policies of the Company encourage hiring diverse candidates and our culture is inclusive, ensuring that all team members are treated fairly and equally, amongst other things.
