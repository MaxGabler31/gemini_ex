ITEM 1. BUSINESSCORPORATE BACKGROUND
Rare Element was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada on June 3, 1999 as Spartacus Capital Inc. We are currently governed under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”). Our executive office address is P.O. Box 271049, Littleton, Colorado 80127. The telephone number for our executive office is (720) 278-2460. We maintain a corporate website at www.rareelementresources.com.
Originally organized as a “capital pool” company whose activities were focused on the identification and completion of a qualifying transaction as required by the rules of the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”), we transitioned to a “venture company” on July 25, 2003, coincident with (1) the completion of a reverse takeover acquisition of Rare Element Holdings Ltd. (the qualifying transaction), (2) a name change of “Spartacus Capital Inc.” to “Rare Element Resources Ltd.,” and (3) the completion of a private placement. The Company’s main assets include its proprietary rare earth processing and/or beneficiation and separation technology and its 100% interest in a group of unpatented mining claims and repurchase rights to adjacent private property, together known as the Bear Lodge Property, owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., a Wyoming corporation.
SUBSIDIARIES
We have one direct wholly owned subsidiary, incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada in 1996 under the name “Rare Element Holdings Ltd.” That subsidiary has one direct wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., incorporated in 1997 in the state of Wyoming, USA, formerly known as Paso Rico (USA), Inc. (“Paso Rico”).
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We are focused on demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of our proprietary recovery and separation technology and advancing the Bear Lodge REE Project located near the town of Sundance in northeast Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project consists of several large, disseminated REE deposits and a planned hydrometallurgical plant to be located near Upton, Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project is one of the highest-grade REE deposits identified in North America and one of the highest-grade Eu deposits in the world. In addition, the Bear Lodge REE Project has a favorable distribution of the remaining CREE.
In its development efforts for the Bear Lodge REE Project, the Company has done extensive laboratory bench-scale and pilot plant testing on metallurgical processes to recover saleable rare earth products and has filed six patents on its metallurgical processing innovations. Among them, the Company has pilot tested and filed for patent protection on a rare earth separation technique that modifies conventional solvent extraction methods used for rare earth separation to be more cost efficient and environmentally sound, involving minimal waste effluents discharged from the process.
During the first quarter of 2016, we placed the Bear Lodge REE Project under care-and-maintenance, and all permitting and licensing activities were suspended. Based on current permitting and licensing timetables and other factors, we anticipate that we could receive all permits and licenses for the Bear Lodge REE Project approximately 18 to 30 months after resuming permitting and licensing efforts, which efforts may be dependent upon the success of our demonstration plant.
Our near-term focus is on the progression of the demonstration plant as further described below. Assuming the demonstration plant operation is successful, the Company plans to evaluate the feasibility of processing and separating REE from the Bear Lodge REE Project as well as other sources.
Once the decision to resume the Bear Lodge REE Project development activities is made, our plan is to advance engineering in preparation for the FS, including an evaluation of a potential modular approach to development beginning with a smaller initial production facility which would then be scaled up. Our ability to begin construction activities on the Bear Lodge REE Project will be subject to various factors including: (i) the availability of adequate capital, (ii) results of 

8



the demonstration plant, (iii) a positive FS, (iv) securing off-take customers at adequate prices, (v) obtaining necessary permits and licenses, and (vi) approval from the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”).
The Bear Lodge REE Project deposit is located near excellent mining infrastructure, including good road access and power lines within two kilometers of the property. The Bear Lodge REE Project site is 100 kilometers east of Gillette, Wyoming, a major infrastructure, support and logistics center for coal mines in the Powder River Basin that should provide for ready access to the required production supplies and materials as well as skilled labor. Additionally, the deposit is situated only 64 kilometers from the nearest railhead at Upton, Wyoming, where the demonstration plant and the proposed hydrometallurgical plant are planned to be sited, allowing access to major distribution channels via the adjacent railhead as well as convenient access to utilities and other infrastructure.
Additional information regarding the Bear Lodge REE Project and the Bear Lodge Property is included under the section heading “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report.
RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
Confirmation and Enhancement of Proprietary Technology
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the pilot plant phase for the confirmation and enhancement of our proprietary technology for recovery and separation of rare earth elements. The work was conducted by Umwelt-und Ingenieurtechnik GmbH Dresden (“UIT”), an affiliate of Synchron, our largest shareholder, and of General Atomics Corporation, a California corporation (“General Atomics”),under an agreement with the Company. The results are to be incorporated into the demonstration plant, as described below.
Department of Energy Financial Award and Rare Earth Demonstration Plant Project
​
In January 2021, a consortium of companies, of which the Company is a part, received notice from the Department of Energy (“DoE”) that the consortium had been selected for negotiation of a potential financial award for the engineering, construction and operation of a rare earth separation and processing demonstration plant. The consortium of companies is led by General Atomics, an affiliate of Synchron, and includes certain of General Atomics’ affiliates, and LNV, an Ardurra Group, Inc. company, as engineering and construction subcontractor. A formal proposal was submitted by the consortium in response to a published Funding Opportunity Announcement in mid-2020 for the construction and operation of a rare earth separation and processing plant utilizing proprietary technology to produce commercial grade products. The DoE finalized the award, and an agreement was executed by the DoE’s grants/agreement officer on September 27, 2021, with an effective date of October 1, 2021. The Company, as a subrecipient of the award, along with the other consortium members, commenced work on the planning and design of the demonstration project in November 2021, with the Company’s contractual arrangement with General Atomics finalized in December 2021. The DoE funding is in the amount of $21,900 and represents approximately one-half of the total estimated costs for the project. The demonstration plant will process already stockpiled high-grade material from the Bear Lodge REE Project.
​
To address the Company’s funding needs, during December 2021, the Company completed a rights offering for gross proceeds of approximately $25,400 in which each holder of the Company’s common shares as of the close of business on the record date of October 19, 2021 was eligible to participate. Terms of the rights offering included the issuance of one subscription right for each common share owned by each holder on the record date, with each subscription right entitling the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at a subscription price of $0.24 per share (the “basic subscription privilege”). If any holder exercised its basic subscription privilege in full, the holder could also exercise an oversubscription privilege to purchase additional common shares for which were unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering, subject to availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising the oversubscription privilege. The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the rights offering for the permitting, licensing, engineering, construction and operation of the demonstration plant near the Company’s Bear Lodge Project and other general corporate purposes, with a portion utilized for the prepayment of outstanding indebtedness, in the principal amount of $1,000, which repayment was completed in December 2021. The previously discussed $21,900 financial award from the DoE for the demonstration plant will fund approximately one-half of the expected total cost of the demonstration plant, with the balance of the required funding being provided by the Company utilizing the proceeds of the rights offering.

​
Even with the completion of the rights offering, the Company does not have sufficient funds to progress with longer-term activities beyond the demonstration plant, including feasibility studies, permitting, licensing, development and construction related to the Bear Lodge REE Project. Therefore, the achievement of these longer-term activities will be dependent upon receipt of additional funds through financings, off-take agreements, joint ventures, strategic transactions, or sales of various assets. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in completing other financings or transactions. Ultimately, in the event that the Company cannot secure additional financial resources, or complete a strategic transaction in the longer term, it may need to suspend its operational plans or even have to liquidate its business interests, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
Further, throughout 2021, we continued to monitor the general U.S. political climate and actions taken by the U.S. government to secure a domestic, rare earth supply chain. The U.S. federal government issued two Presidential Executive Orders in 2017 to encourage and support the establishment of a domestic rare earth supply chain and to strengthen the defense industrial base with respect to critical minerals including rare earths. In June 2019, the Department of Commerce released its report entitled “Federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals.” This was followed by five U.S. Presidential Determinations on July 22, 2019, directed to the Secretary of Defense. One Presidential Determination declared that “the domestic production capability for Rare Earth Metals and Alloys is essential to the national defense.” These initiatives have increased the federal government’s level of interest in the rare earth industry and our potential rare earth products as a critical upstream segment of the supply chain, particularly considering Chinese dominance in the global rare earth market. In addition, COVID-19 has further focused the U.S. government on the importance of implementing secure domestic supply chains, including for rare earths, leading to a further Presidential Executive Order issued in February 2021 calling for an expedited 100-day review to address the strengthening of America’s supply chains, specifically requiring the Department of Defense to (i) submit a report identifying “risks in the supply chain of critical minerals and other strategic materials including rare earth elements” and (ii) make policy recommendations to address the risks. The 100-day review led to another Executive Order on June 8, 2021, calling for an investment in sustainable domestic and international production and processing of critical minerals, including a recommendation that Congress take actions to recapitalize and restore the National Defense Stockpile of critical minerals and materials. The Company monitors and participates in these initiatives as they are critical to the production of rare earth magnets used in the United States to support the manufacturing of, among other things, defense technologies, electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and oil refining equipment. 
COVID-19 Impact on Business
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented travel restrictions, both domestically and internationally, and our employee and consultants abided by government guidance and orders. As a result, we saw delays in the metallurgical studies conducted by UIT that slowed the progression of the prior test work. Although the slower progression is not material to the Company’s plans at this time, any continued pandemic impact may be material to the completion of the design inputs needed for the demonstration plant. Any further economic downturn triggered by COVID-19 and any resulting direct and indirect negative impact on us could have a material adverse impact on our future activities, cash flows and liquidity. We may experience higher prices for the equipment and raw materials for the demonstration plant due to shortages, commodity inflation and supply chain issues, including transportation delays as a result of COVID-19 and other economic factors. Further, it is unknown what, if any, impact COVID-19 and any resulting economic factors will have on rare earth prices and market supply and demand fundamentals. For further discussion of this matter, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II of this report.
TRENDS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE REE MARKET
Uses for REE Products
Due to variations in physical, chemical, molecular and application characteristics, different rare earth metals possess their own market uses, drivers and challenges. REEs are used in computers, cellular telephones, television screens, wind turbines, fuel cells, automobiles, magnetic refrigeration technologies, energy-efficient lighting, petroleum-refining catalysts and numerous other modern specialty technologies including military applications. Lately, the major driver for the rare earth metals market has been the increasing consumption in permanent NdFeB rare earth magnets, in which rare earth metals such as Nd, Pr, Tb, and Dy are used. Specifically, these REEs are used in hybrid-electric vehicles and all-

10



electric vehicles as well as in wind turbines. Ce, La, and other REE are widely used in applications such as metallurgy, catalysts, glass, ceramics, optical instruments, and polishing.
Trends Affecting REE Supply, Demand and Prices 
In 2021, rare earth mine production was estimated to total 250,000 tonnes REO with refined production estimated to be 170,000 tonnes REO, a 13% increase from 2020 due to increased production from China to over 140,000 tonnes REO. China dominates the global supply of rare earths at both the mined and refined stages, accounting for 62% of global mine production and 83% of refined production in 2021. An additional 15% of refined production came from Asia Pacific. China’s decreased share of global mine production is partly due to increased U.S. production of concentrate products which are sent to China for downstream refining. 
In the rest of the world, specifically in the U.S. and Australia, certain competitors constitute the second tier of rare earth concentrate producing companies, with the largest production of 42,000 tonnes REO from the U.S. A facility in Malaysia produces separated rare earths from about 52,000 tonnes REO mine production in Australia.

The rapid growth in demand for certain REE, specifically Nd and Pr used in permanent magnets, is expected to continue as magnets containing REE give improved performance compared with other magnets. Increased focus on clean energy is pushing the demand for wind turbines and electric vehicles, which in turn will drive the demand for rare earth magnets in electric motor and generator applications. Magnet demand now accounts for approximately 39% of total rare earth demand and greater than 80% of REE market value.
The research and advisory firm, Wood Mackenzie Limited, has estimated that the annual global demand for rare earth oxides for use in permanent magnets reached 56,500 tonnes REO in 2020, representing 39% of total REE demand. For 2022 the forecast demand for the automotive sector is equivalent to 19,100 tonnes REO. The firm anticipates overall growth in demand from automotive and renewable energy generation to grow at very rapid rates through 2030 of 17.5% and 14.9% respectively. Cumulative wind energy generation capacity is forecast to increase from 754 gigawatts (“GW”) in 2020 to 2,312 GW in 2035, before reaching 3,977.6 GW by 2050. Rare earth demand is forecast to increase from 3.3 thousand tonnes (“kt”) REO in 2020 to 11.2 kt in 2035, a CAGR of 8.4%. Demand is forecast to peak at 14.5 kt REO in 2043. 
Supply and demand factors for REE products that could positively impact future REE prices include the following, among other factors:




● | the use of Nd, Pr, Tb and Dy in high-strength magnets that are critical to multiple defense applications, hybrid and electric vehicles and the increased construction of wind power generation facilities, particularly large off-shore installations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the use of high-strength NdFeB magnets in the miniaturization of electronic products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the use of La in FCCs by refineries processing lower quality crude oil that consumes greater quantities of the catalysts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the increased use of REEs in the drive to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHGs by the U.S., China and the European Union;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China consolidating its REE industry and closing small, inefficient and polluting REE producers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the capping of production, tightening of export volumes and imports by China;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in trade policies, including changes in taxes or import/export duties for REE materials by the U.S. government and China;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | the use of Ce in glass, ceramics, glass polishing, and advanced water filtration applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the continued research and commercialization of new applications for REE products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the rising costs in China due to stricter environmental controls and rising wages.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply and demand factors for REE products that could negatively impact future REE prices include the following, among other factors:







● | the potential for oversupply of certain REEs due to new production outside of China and/or increased exports from China;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strong demand for selected REEs like magnet materials, driving overproduction of other co-product REEs and creating oversupply conditions for the less desired REEs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential substitution of other materials for higher-priced REEs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | economization by intermediate and end-users to reduce their usage of REEs in end-products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential for increased recycling of higher-priced REEs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | fluctuating oil, gas and coal prices that could reduce the demand for technologies using REEs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | static or lower global economic growth, reducing overall demand growth for REEs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential by-product production of REEs that may increase supply irrespective of the economics of REE production from primary mines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The feasibility of the Bear Lodge REE Project and our ability to raise additional funds to develop the Bear Lodge REE Project may be impacted by global supply and demand and future prices of REEs.
SEASONALITY
At this stage, seasonality in the state of Wyoming is not a material factor to any future exploration, development and operating activities on the Bear Lodge Property. Snowfall in the winter may temporarily limit our access to the Bear Lodge Property and our ability to explore or operate from approximately November through June, but it is not a material issue at this time.
COMPETITION 
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other mining and exploration companies, both within the U.S. and internationally, for the exploration and development of mineral properties and production of REEs as well as funding for projects. There is competition for the limited number of opportunities, some involving companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do, and some with rare earth operational experience. We also compete with other mining and exploration companies in our efforts to hire and retain experienced professionals. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or securing outside technical resources.
In 2021, China accounted for an estimated 62% of global REE mine production and 83% of refined production. Wood MacKenzie has forecasted that throughout the next three decades, China will continue to account for 49-56% of worldwide refined product demand reaching 180,900 tonnes by 2050 (51.5% of 2020 global demand). It is likely that the Chinese will be able to dominate the market for REEs for the foreseeable future. This gives the Chinese producers a competitive advantage in controlling the supply and processing of REEs and an opportunity to influence prices to discourage 

12



competition. Any increase in the amount of REEs exported from other nations increases supply and may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. As a result of these factors, the Company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES 
We plan to rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure agreements, trademarks and patents to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had filed six U.S. provisional patent applications relating to processing methods, including (1) selective recovery of REEs from mixed chloride leach solutions using oxalic acid, (2) thorium extraction process technology, and (3) separation of cerium and/or thorium from bulk REEs in a solvent extraction (“SX”) process. These provisional applications provided the basis for the current patent portfolio, which includes one issued U.S. patent and one pending U.S. patent application, one pending foreign application, and fourteen issued foreign patents across thirteen separate foreign jurisdictions. The issued patents have a term of 20 years measured from the filing date of the utility patent applications. We licensed our intellectual property relating to our patents-pending and related technical information to Synchron in October 2017, which license became exclusive to Synchron and its affiliates in October 2019, subject to the Company’s ownership and use rights in the intellectual property and any improvements made thereon. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. Several of these technologies have potential value for application in other industries, and the Company is evaluating this potential.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Our exploration and planned development, mining and processing activities are subject to extensive and demanding environmental laws and regulations under various federal, state, county and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, which generally includes air and water quality, hazardous waste management, radionuclide handling and reclamation. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal liability for non-compliance, fines and penalties, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Also, unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect. Environmental laws historically have evolved in a manner that requires stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Current and future laws, regulations and permits will impose significant costs, liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue operations or undertake new operations. The change in the U.S. presidential administration and the change in composition of Congress in 2021 and thereafter, could result in more stringent environmental regulation of our operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we hold interests that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by previous owners of the properties.
Our Bear Lodge Property in Wyoming is subject to federal and state environmental laws, regulations, and permits. The federal agency with primary regulatory jurisdiction is the U.S. Forest Service (the “USFS”), Bearlodge Ranger District, Sundance, Wyoming. The state agency with regulatory jurisdiction is the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. We operate under approvals and permits granted by these two agencies and have established a surety bond to ensure environmental reclamation of areas disturbed. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds surety bond with the state of Wyoming of $132. Prior to operating, we will require several other permits and licenses including those issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others.
MINERALS EXPLORATION REGULATION
Mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, county and local laws and regulations in the U.S. that govern prospecting, exploration, development, mining, production, processing, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, 

13



health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no current orders or notices of violations relating to the Company under applicable laws and regulations.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and could subject it to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH REGULATIONS
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd–Frank Act”), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the U.S. are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Bear Lodge Property was not subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2021, we had one full-time employee and no part-time employees. Our employee is not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. When required, our employee calls on the services of third parties under consulting or service agreements.
