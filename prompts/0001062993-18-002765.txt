 Corporate Overview 
 Our company offers retail consumers bottled alkaline water in 500-milliliter, 700-milliliter, 1-liter, 1.5 -liter, 3-liter and 1-gallon sizes under the trade name Alkaline88®. Our product is produced through an electrolysis process that uses specialized electronic cells coated with a variety of rare earth minerals to produce our 8.8 pH drinking water without the use of any chemicals. Our product also incorporates 84 trace minerals from Himalayan salt. Our product was designed to have a clean smooth taste using only purified water and the Himalayan salt. Consumers drink our water because of the taste profile and the perceived health benefits. We are now one of the largest (by sales volume) alkaline water companies in the United States.

Our company, The Alkaline Water Company Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2011.
 On February 20, 2013, The Alkaline Water Company Inc. entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Alkaline 88, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alkaline Water Corp at the time., for the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of the capital of Alkaline 88, LLC. Further to this letter of intent, on May 31, 2013, The Alkaline Water Company Inc. entered into a share exchange agreement with Alkaline Water Corp. and all of its stockholders, and as a result of the closing of this agreement on the same date, Alkaline Water Corp. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Alkaline Water Company Inc. Consequently, after the closing of this agreement, we adopted the business of Alkaline Water Corp.s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Alkaline 88, LLC. 
 On March 3, 2018, Alkaline Water Corp. was merged into Alkaline 88, LLC with Alkaline88, LLC being the surviving entity. Accordingly, Alkaline88, LLC is currently the sole wholly-owned subsidiary of The Alkaline Water Company Inc. 
 On May 3, 2017, we designated 3,000,000 shares of the authorized and unissued preferred stock of our company as Series D Preferred Stock by filing a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On November 2, 2017, we increased the number of authorized shares of Series D Preferred Stock in our company to 5,000,000 shares by filing an Amendment to the foregoing Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. Each share of the Series D Preferred Stock will be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder and at the option of the holder, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of our common stock at any time after (i) we achieve the consolidated revenue of our company and all of its subsidiaries equal to or greater than $40,000,000 in any 12 month period, ending on the last day of any quarterly period of our fiscal year; or (ii) a Negotiated Trigger Event, defined as an event upon which the Series D Preferred Stock will be convertible as may be agreed by our company and the holder in writing from time to time.
 The principal offices of our company are located at 14646 N. Kierland Blvd, Suite 255, Scottsdale, AZ 85254. Our telephone number is (480) 656-2423. 
 Operations 
 Alkaline 88, LLC, our operating subsidiary, operates primarily as a marketing, distribution, and manufacturing company. Alkaline 88, LLC has entered into co-packing agreements with six different bottling companies in Virginia, Georgia, California, Texas and Arizona to act as co-packers for our product. Our current capacity at all plants exceeds $7,000,000 per month wholesale. Our branding is being coordinated through 602 Design, LLC and our component materials are readily available through multiple vendors. Our principal suppliers are Vav Plastics Inc., Amcor Inc. and Packaging Corporation of America. 
 Our product is currently at the expansion phase of its lifecycle. In March 2012, Alkaline 88, LLC did market research on the demand for a bulk alkaline product at the Natural Product Expo West in Anaheim, California. In January 2013, we began the formal launching of our product in Southern California and Arizona. Since then, we have begun to deliver product through approximately 40,000 retail outlets throughout the United States. We are presently in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, although over 50% of our current sales are concentrated in the Southwest and Texas. We have distribution agreements with large national distributors (e.g., UNFI, KeHe, and C&S), representing over 150,000 retail establishments. Our current stores include convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Currently, we sell all of our products to our retailers through brokers and distributors. Our larger retail clients bring the water in through their own warehouse distribution network. Our current retail clients are made up of a variety of the following; convenience stores, including 7-11s; large national retailers, including Walmart, Albertsons/Safeway, Kroger companies, and regional grocery chains such as Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas, Bristol Farms, Stater Brothers, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Brookshires, HEB and other companies throughout the United States. In total we are now in more than half of the top 75 (by sales) grocery retailers in the United States.

In April 2014, we entered into an exclusive territorial distribution agreement with Kalil Bottling Co. on a new single serve 700ml bottle with a sport cap. This exclusivity is in Arizona and other areas in the Southwestern United States. Kalil Bottling Co. is a direct to store distributor (DSD). 
 In order to continue our expansion, we anticipate that we will be required, in most cases, to continue to give promotional deals throughout 2018 and in subsequent years on a quarterly basis ranging from a 5%-20% discount similar to all other beverage company promotional programs. It has been our experience that most of the retailers have requested some type of promotional introductory program which has included either a $0.25 -$0.50 per unit discount on an initial order; a buy one get one free program; or a free-fill program which includes 1- 2 cases of free product per store location. Slotting has only been presented and negotiated in the larger national grocery chains and, in most cases, is offset by product sales. 
 Plan of Operations 
 In order for us to implement our business plan over the next twelve-month period, we have identified the following milestones that we expect to achieve: 
 

Expansion of Broker Network  We expect to continue to develop our
 working relationship with our national broker network. We continually meet,
 train, and go on sales call with our national broker network in order to take
 advantage of the momentum currently being created by their efforts. We
 anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing expenses at an
 estimated cost during that time of $300,000. 

Increase Manufacturing Capacity  We expect to add one or two new
 co-packer facilities, strategically located to reduce freight costs and meet
 current volumes and future growth objectives. 

Expand Retail Distribution  We believe that by the end of fiscal
 year 2019, we will be in over 50,000 stores. The cost of this retail expansion
 is expected to be up to $2,000,000 during that time. 

Addition of Support Staff  In order to support expansion efforts
 and to continue the training and support of our broker network, we will need
 to hire approximately two more people on the corporate level, which will be
 hired for the specific purpose of supporting the broker, distributor and
 retailers and their logistical and accounting requirements. We continue to
 seek and interview candidates to fill our growing need for additional
 staffing. The additional cost of these new hires is expected to be
 approximately $200,000 in salary and benefits over the next twelve months.


Capital Considerations  Our business plan can be adjusted based on
 the available capital to the business. We anticipate that approximately
 $2,000,000 is necessary in the near term in order to build-out a national
 presence for our product and to allow for the purchase of the necessary
 equipment and facilities over the next twelve months. To fund our expansion in
 the longer term, we anticipate that we need at least $3,000,000 during the
 next 12 months. 

International Expansion  We expect to begin selling internationally
 over the next 12 months and have budgeted $160,000 towards our initial
 efforts. 
 We believe that cash flow from operations will not meet our present and near-term cash needs and thus we will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We estimate that our capital needs over the next 12 months will be up to $3,000,000. We will require additional cash resources to achieve the milestones indicated above. If our own financial resources and future cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

Distribution Method for Our Product 
 Our distribution network is a broker-distributor-retailer network, whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers. Our target retail markets are: (a) chain and independent health food stores; (b) grocery stores; (c) convenience stores; (d) drug stores; and (e) the mass retail market. We have recently gained broker representation through Advantage Solutions for the continued expansion into our target retail markets. 
 We have distribution agreements with large national distributors (UNFI, KeHe, CoreMark, and C&S), representing over 150,000 retail establishments. Our current retailers include convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Currently, we sell all of our products to our retailers through brokers and distributors. Our larger retail clients bring the water in through their own warehouse distribution network. Our current retail clients are made up of a variety of the following; convenience stores, including 7-11s; large national retailers, including Walmart, Albertsons/Safeway, Kroger companies, and regional grocery chains such as Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas, Bristol Farms, Stater Brothers, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Brookshires, HEB and other companies throughout the United States. In total we are now in more than half of the top 75 (by sale) grocery retailers in the United States. 
 Dependence on Few Customers 
 We have 3 major customers that together account for 51% (25%, 16% and 10%, respectively) of accounts receivable at March 31, 2018, and 3 customers that together account for 47% (25%, 12%, and 10%, respectively) of the total revenues earned for the year ended March 31, 2018. 
 There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Marketing 
 We intend to continue to market our product through our broker network and to avail ourselves to the promotional activities of other companies and competitors regarding the benefits of alkaline water. We anticipate that our initial marketing thrust will be to support the retailers and distribution network with point of sales displays and other marketing materials, strategically adding an extensive public relations program and other marketing as the markets dictate. 
Competition 
 The beverage industry is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our product will be competing directly with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other marketing campaigns. In addition, companies manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we have. 
 Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include the continued public perception of the benefits of alkaline water, taste and flavor of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique and cutting edge products, attractive and unique packaging, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network. 
 We will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. The extremely competitive pressures within the beverage categories could result in our product never even being introduced beyond what they can market locally themselves. 
 Page 7 

Our product will compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as Core Hydration, SoBe, Snapple, Arizona Ice Tea, Vitamin Water, Gatorade, and Powerade. We will compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including Eternal, Essentia, Icelandic, Real Water, Aqua Hydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. 
 Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $0.99 for a half-liter bottle to $4.99 for a one-gallon bottle, and volumes ranging from half-liter bottles to one-and-a half liter bottles. We currently offer our product in a three-liter bottle for a suggested retail price (SRP) of $3.99, one-gallon bottle for an SRP of $4.99, 1.5 -liter at an SRP of $2.49, 1 liter at an SRP of $1.99, 700 milliliter single serving at an SRP of $1.19, and a 500 milliliter at an SRP of $0.99. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Where available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. The trademark for Alkaline88® has been registered in the USA, Canada, Hong Kong, and has been applied for in China. 
 While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our sales and operating strategy. 
 Seasonality of Business 
 The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our product and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. 
Government Regulation 
 The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our product will be subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. 
 Legal requirements apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary and are constantly evolving. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States.

Any third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. 
Employees 
 In addition to Richard A. Wright, who is our president, chief executive officer and director, and David A. Guarino, who is our chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and director, we currently employ 11 full time employees and 1 part-time employee. We also work with retail brokers in the United States who are paid on a contract basis. Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our managements relationships with manufacturers, distillers, development/research companies, bottling concerns, and certain retail customers will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks. We also plan to form an independent network of contract sales and regional managers, a promotional support team, and several market segment specialists who will be paid on a variable basis.
