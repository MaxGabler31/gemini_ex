--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since we began operations in March 2003, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in-licensing, clinical development and commercialization of our products. Our ability to generate meaningful product sales and achieve profitability largely depends on our level of success in commercializing HETLIOZ® in the U.S. and Europe and Fanapt® in the U.S. alone or with others, to complete the development of our products, and to obtain the regulatory approvals for and to manufacture, market and sell our products. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and depend on a number of factors, including risks related to our business, risks related to our industry, and other risks which are detailed in Item 1A of Part I entitled Risk Factors and Item 7 of Part II entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital in 2018 and beyond. We are currently concentrating our efforts on selling HETLIOZ® and Fanapt® in the U.S. and our continued commercialization of HETLIOZ® in Europe. Additionally, we continue to pursue market approval of HETLIOZ® and Fanapt® in other regions. We will continue to work with our distribution partners on the commercialization of Fanapt® outside the U.S. We see opportunities to grow our commercial products through life cycle management strategies that include the addition of new indications and formulations. We have built a research and development organization that includes extensive expertise in the scientific disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. Our pipeline includes novel programs that could address largely unmet medical needs. 
 Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, M.D., started Vandas operations in early 2003 after establishing and leading the Pharmacogenetics Department at Novartis. In acquiring and developing our products, we have relied upon our deep expertise in the scientific disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. These scientific disciplines examine both genetic variations among people that influence response to a particular drug, and the multiple pathways through which drugs affect people. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to create a leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies addressing high unmet medical needs through the application of our drug development expertise and our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish this goal are to: 

 | Maximize the commercial success of HETLIOZ® and Fanapt®;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | Enter into strategic partnerships to supplement our capabilities and to extend our commercial reach;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HETLIOZ®
Commercial opportunity: Non-24
In January 2014, HETLIOZ® was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Non-24. Non-24 is a serious, rare and chronic circadian rhythm disorder characterized by the inability to entrain (synchronize) the master body clock with the 24-hour day-night cycle. HETLIOZ® is the first FDA approved treatment for Non-24. HETLIOZ® is a melatonin agonist of the human MT1 and MT2 receptors, with greater specificity for MT2. These receptors are thought to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms. HETLIOZ® is believed to reset the master body clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, located in the hypothalamus, resulting in the entrainment and alignment of the bodys melatonin and cortisol rhythms to the 24-hour day-night cycle. HETLIOZ® was launched commercially in the U.S. in April 2014. In addition, in July 2015, the EC granted centralized marketing authorization with unified labeling for HETLIOZ® for the treatment of Non-24 in totally blind adults and included post-marketing commitments related to a pediatric investigation plan. This authorization is valid in the 28 countries that are members of the European Union (E.U.), as well as European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. HETLIOZ® was launched commercially in Germany in August 2016. 
 In January 2010, the FDA granted orphan drug designation status for HETLIOZ® in Non-24 in blind individuals. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting 200,000 or fewer U.S. patients per year. Orphan drug designation provides potential financial and regulatory incentives, including study design assistance, tax credits, waiver of FDA user fees, and up to seven years of market exclusivity upon marketing approval. In February 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) designated HETLIOZ® as an orphan medicinal product for the same indication. 
 Non-24 affects a majority of totally blind individuals, or approximately 80,000 people in the U.S. Blind individuals who develop Non-24 lack the light sensitivity necessary to synchronize the master body clock in the brain with the 24-hour day-night cycle. In sighted individuals, decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and social and physical activity cues may contribute to a free-running circadian rhythm. With the high frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases of Non-24 developing after a change in sleep habits, behavioral factors in combination with physiological tendency may precipitate and perpetuate this disorder in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues, predisposing them to the development of Non-24.
Most people have a master body clock that naturally runs longer than 24-hours and light is the primary environmental cue that resets it to 24 hours each day. Individuals with Non-24 have a master body clock that is not reset, and continually delays, resulting in prolonged periods of misalignment between their circadian rhythms and the 24-hour day-night cycle, including the timing of melatonin and cortisol secretion. As a result of this misalignment, Non-24 is associated with significant disruption of the sleep-wake cycle and impairments in social and occupational functioning, and marked subjective distress. Individuals with Non-24 cycle in-and out-of phase and suffer from disrupted nighttime sleep patterns and/or excessive daytime sleepiness. 
 While there are no FDA or EC approved treatments for Non-24 other than HETLIOZ®, there are a number of drugs approved and prescribed for patients with sleep disorders. The most commonly prescribed drugs are hypnotics. See Competition below for a discussion of commonly prescribed drugs for patients with sleep disorders. 
 Therapeutic opportunity: Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders 
 Sleep disorders are segmented into three major categories: primary insomnia, secondary insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs). Insomnia is a symptom complex that comprises difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or non-refreshing sleep, in combination with daytime dysfunction or distress. The symptom complex can be an independent disorder (primary insomnia) or be a result of another condition such as depression or anxiety (secondary insomnia). CRSDs result from a misalignment of the sleep/wake cycle and an individuals daily activities or lifestyle. The circadian rhythm is the rhythmic output of the human biological clock and is governed by the hormones melatonin and cortisol. Both the timing of behavioral events (activity, sleep, and social interactions) and the environmental light/dark cycle result in a sleep/wake cycle that follows the circadian rhythm. Examples of CRSDs include transient disorders such as jet lag and chronic disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, shift work sleep disorder and Non-24. We are planning to develop HETLIOZ® for the treatment of pediatric Non-24. We initiated a pediatric liquid formulation pharmacokinetic study in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 We initiated an open label interventional study in patients with SMS in the fourth quarter of 2015 and shared the results at the joint congress of World Association of Sleep Medicine and World Sleep federation in October 2017, which showed that parents of children with SMS reported improvement in sleep quality and a decrease in aberrant behaviors during treatment as compared to baseline. We initiated a SMS placebo controlled study in the fourth quarter of 2016. Enrollment in this study is ongoing. SMS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deletion on chromosome 17. The U.S. National Institute of Health estimates that SMS affects approximately one in 20,000 births in the U.S.

We initiated an observational study in Jet Lag Disorder in the fourth quarter of 2015. The data from that study was used to support clinical study design for our two placebo controlled studies. We initiated a placebo controlled transmeridian travel study in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a placebo controlled simulated jet lag study in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 Fanapt®
Commercial Opportunity: Schizophrenia 
 Fanapt® is a product for the treatment of schizophrenia. In May 2009, the FDA granted U.S. marketing approval of Fanapt® for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In October 2009, we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with Novartis. We had originally entered into a sublicense agreement with Novartis in June 2004 pursuant to which we obtained certain worldwide exclusive licenses from Novartis relating to Fanapt®. Pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement, Novartis had exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of Fanapt® in the U.S. and Canada. In January 2010, Novartis launched Fanapt® in the U.S. On December 31, 2014, Novartis transferred all the U.S. and Canadian commercial rights to the Fanapt® franchise to Vanda as part of a settlement agreement. In June 2015, we announced positive results from REPRIEVE, a Phase III long-term maintenance study that was conducted by Novartis. In May 2016, the FDA approved a sNDA for Fanapt® for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. 
 In July 2017, the EMAs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a negative opinion recommending against approval of Fanaptum® (oral iloperidone tablets) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients in the E.U. The CHMP was of the opinion that the benefits of Fanaptum® did not outweigh its risks and recommended against marketing authorization. The negative opinion was upheld upon appeal in November 2017. 
 We received market approval for the commercialization of Fanapt® in Israel in August 2012 and in Mexico in October 2013. Our distribution partners launched Fanapt® in Israel and Mexico in 2014. As of December 31, 2017, we no longer have an active distributor relationship in Mexico. 
 Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, racing thoughts and other psychotic symptoms (collectively referred to as positive symptoms), as well as moodiness, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), loss of interest, eating disturbances and withdrawal (collectively referred to as negative symptoms), and attention and memory deficits (collectively referred to as cognitive symptoms). Schizophrenia develops in late adolescence or early adulthood in approximately 1% of the worlds population. Most schizophrenia patients today are treated with drugs known as atypical antipsychotics, which were first approved in the U.S. in the late 1980s. These antipsychotics have been named atypical for their ability to treat a broader range of negative symptoms than the first-generation typical antipsychotics, which were introduced in the 1950s and are now generic. Atypical antipsychotics are generally regarded as having improved side effect profiles and efficacy relative to typical antipsychotics. See Competition below for a discussion of commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics in addition to Fanapt®. 
 Pursuant to a settlement agreement with Novartis, we reacquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to the long-acting injectable (depot) formulation of Fanapt®. We are evaluating the commercial opportunity around the depot formulation. 
 Therapeutic opportunity: Other 
 We are currently in the process of evaluating potential indications, including bipolar depression, major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder  nightmares. 
 Tradipitant (VLY-686)
Tradipitant is a small molecule NK-1R antagonist that we licensed from Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) in April 2012. NK-1R antagonists have been evaluated in a number of indications including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, post-operative nausea and vomiting, gastroparesis, alcohol dependence, anxiety, depression and chronic pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. 
 We commenced a Phase II clinical study of tradipitant in the treatment of chronic pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis in 2014. Results from this study, which were announced in March 2015, showed no significant difference from placebo on the pre-specified primary endpoint. Vanda believes this proof of concept study was informative, in that through subsequent analyses, it revealed statistically significant and clinically meaningful responses across multiple outcomes evaluated in individuals with higher blood plasma levels of tradipitant at the time of their pruritus assessments. We initiated a placebo controlled pruritus proof of concept study in the second quarter of 2016. Results from this study, which were announced in September 2017, showed significant improvements in itch and disease severity. These results were presented at the 9th World Congress of Itch in October 2017.

We initiated a placebo controlled Phase II clinical study of tradipitant in the treatment of gastroparesis in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 VTR-297
VTR-297 is a small molecule HDAC inhibitor with potential use as a treatment for several oncology indications. The FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for VTR-297 in 2017 and provided authorization to proceed with the treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies. 
 VQW-765
VQW-765 is a Phase II alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that we licensed from Novartis on December 31, 2014 pursuant to a settlement agreement. We are evaluating potential indications, including cognitive impairment. 
 License Agreements 
 Our rights to develop and commercialize our products are subject to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by other pharmaceutical companies. 
 HETLIOZ®
In February 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) under which we received an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications, and other licenses to intellectual property, to develop and commercialize HETLIOZ®. As a result of the FDAs approval of the HETLIOZ® New Drug Application (NDA) in January 2014, we made an $8.0 million milestone payment to BMS in the first quarter of 2014 under the license agreement that was capitalized as an intangible asset and is being amortized over the estimated economic useful life of the related product patents which is the remaining life of the U.S. method of use patent for HETLIOZ® in the U.S. We are obligated to make a future milestone payment to BMS of $25.0 million when cumulative worldwide sales of HETLIOZ® reach $250.0 million, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2018. The probable future $25.0 million milestone obligation was capitalized as an intangible asset in the first quarter of 2015 and is being amortized over the estimated economic useful life of the related product patents which is the remaining life of the U.S. method of use patent for HETLIOZ® in the U.S. Additionally, we are obligated to make royalty payments on HETLIOZ® net sales to BMS in any territory where we commercialize HETLIOZ® for a period equal to the greater of 10 years following the first commercial sale in the territory or the expiry of the new chemical entity patent in that territory. During the period prior to the expiry of the new chemical entity patent in a territory, we are obligated to pay a 10% royalty on net sales in that territory. The royalty rate is decreased by half for countries in which no new chemical entity patent existed or for the remainder of the 10 years after the expiry of the new chemical entity patent. We are also obligated under the license agreement to pay BMS a percentage of any sublicense fees, upfront payments and milestone and other payments (excluding royalties) that we receive from a third party in connection with any sublicensing arrangement, at a rate which is in the mid-twenties. We have agreed with BMS in our license agreement for HETLIOZ® to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize HETLIOZ®.Either party may terminate the HETLIOZ® license agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other. In the event we terminate our license, or if BMS terminates our license due to our breach, all rights licensed and developed by us under this agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to BMS on an exclusive basis. 
 Fanapt®
Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement with Novartis, Novartis transferred all U.S. and Canadian rights in the Fanapt® franchise to us on December 31, 2014. We were obligated to make royalty payments to Sanofi S.A. (Sanofi) and Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Titan) at a percentage rate equal to 23% on annual U.S. net sales of Fanapt® up to $200.0 million, and at a percentage rate in the mid-twenties on sales over $200.0 million through November 2016. In February 2016, we amended the agreement with Sanofi and Titan to remove Titan as the entity through which royalty payments from Vanda are directed to Sanofi following the expiration of the new chemical entity patent for Fanapt® in the U.S. on November 15, 2016. Under the amended agreement, we pay directly to Sanofi a fixed royalty of 3% of net sales from November 16, 2016 through December 31, 2019 related to manufacturing know-how. We made a $2.0 million pre-payment during the year ended December 31, 2016 that applied to this 3% manufacturing know-how royalty. No further royalties on manufacturing know-how are payable by us after December 31, 2019. This amended agreement did not alter Titans obligation under the license agreement to make royalty payments to Sanofi prior to November 16, 2016 or our obligation to pay Sanofi a fixed royalty on Fanapt® net sales equal up to 6% on Sanofi know-how not

 related to manufacturing under certain conditions for a period of up to 10 years in markets where the new chemical entity patent has expired or was not issued. We may lose our rights to develop and commercialize Fanapt® if we fail to comply with certain requirements in the Titan license agreement regarding our financial condition, or if we fail to comply with certain diligence obligations regarding our development or commercialization activities. 
 Tradipitant (VLY-686)
In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Lilly pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications, and other licenses to intellectual property, to develop and commercialize an NK-1R antagonist, tradipitant, for all human indications. The patent describing tradipitant as a new chemical entity expires in April 2023, except in the U.S., where it expires in June 2024 absent any applicable patent term adjustments. Lilly is eligible to receive future payments based upon achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones as well as tiered-royalties on net sales at percentage rates up to the low double digits. These milestones include $4.0 million for pre-NDA approval milestones and up to $95.0 million for future regulatory approval and sales milestones. The $4.0 million of pre-NDA approval milestones includes $2.0 million due upon enrollment of the first subject into a Phase III study for tradipitant and $2.0 million due upon the filing of the first marketing authorization for tradipitant in either the U.S. or the E.U. The likelihood of achieving the enrollment of the first subject into a Phase III study for tradipitant was determined to be probable during the third quarter of 2017. As a result, the future obligation of $2.0 million tied to such milestone was recorded as research and development expense in 2017. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tradipitant. Either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other. In the event that we terminate the agreement, or if Lilly terminates the agreement due to our breach or for certain other reasons set forth in the agreement, all rights licensed and developed by us under the agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to Lilly on an exclusive basis, subject to payment by Lilly to us of a royalty on net sales of products that contain tradipitant. 
 VQW-765
In connection with the settlement agreement with Novartis relating to Fanapt®, we received an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications, and other licenses to intellectual property, to develop and commercialize VQW-765, a Phase II alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize VQW-765 and are responsible for all development costs. We have no milestone obligations, but Novartis is eligible to receive tiered-royalties on net sales at percentage rates up to the mid-teens.
Either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other. In the event that we terminate the agreement, or if Novartis terminates the agreement due to our breach or for certain other reasons set forth in the agreement, all rights licensed and developed by us under the agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to Novartis on an exclusive basis, subject to payment by Novartis to us of a royalty on net sales of products that contain VQW-765.
Portfolio of CFTR activators and inhibitors 
 In March 2017, we entered into a license agreement with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), under which we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize a portfolio of CFTR activators and inhibitors. Pursuant to the license agreement, we will develop and commercialize the CFTR activators and inhibitors and are responsible for all development costs under the license agreement, including current pre-investigational new drug development work. The license agreement provides for an initial license fee of $1.0 million, which was paid by us in the first quarter of 2017, annual maintenance fees and up to $46.0 million in potential regulatory and sales milestone obligations. UCSF is also eligible to receive single-digit tiered royalties on net sales. 
 Either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. In the event that we terminate the agreement, or if UCSF terminates the agreement due to our breach or for certain other reasons set forth in the agreement, all rights licensed and developed by us under the agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to UCSF. Termination will not relieve Vanda of its obligation to pay royalties or other payments owed, if any, to UCSF under the terms of the agreement. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, as well as foreign countries and local foreign governments, regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing, import and export of our products. Other than HETLIOZ® in the U.S. and the E.U. and Fanapt® in the U.S., Israel and Mexico, all of our products will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations require the expenditure of significant time and human and financial resources.

United States government regulation 
 FDA approval process 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implements regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any such sanction could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. include: 
 

 | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under Current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | execution of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication for which approval is sought;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and activity of a drug. Violation of the FDAs cGLP regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring these studies to be replicated. In the U.S., drug developers submit the results of pre-clinical trials, together with manufacturing information and analytical and stability data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials can begin in the U.S. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the proposed clinical trials outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. If these concerns or questions are unresolved, the FDA may not allow the clinical trials to commence. 
 Pilot studies generally are conducted in a limited patient population, approximately three to 25 subjects, to determine whether the drug warrants further clinical trials based on preliminary indications of efficacy. These pilot studies may be performed in the U.S. after an IND has become effective or outside of the U.S. prior to the filing of an IND in the U.S. in accordance with applicable government regulations and institutional procedures. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the effectiveness of the drug. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND prior to beginning the trial. 
 Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-Phase sequential process, but the phases may overlap. Each trial must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board, and each trial must include the patients informed consent. 
 

 | Phase I: refers typically to closely-monitored clinical trials and includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into human patients or healthy volunteer subjects. Phase I trials are designed to determine the safety, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of a drug in humans, the potential side effects associated with increasing drug doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence of the drugs effectiveness. Phase I trials also include the study of structure-activity relationships and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational new drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. During Phase I trials, sufficient information about a drugs pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid Phase II studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase I trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80 people.

9 
 

 | Phase II: refers to controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate appropriate dosage and the effectiveness of a drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with a disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. These trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III: refers to expanded controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. These trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of a drug has been obtained. Phase III trials are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials usually include several hundred to several thousand subjects.

 Phase I, II and III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. A clinical program is designed after assessing the causes of the disease, the mechanism of action of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug and all clinical and pre-clinical data of previous trials performed. Typically, the trial design protocols and efficacy endpoints are established in consultation with the FDA. Upon request through a special protocol assessment, the FDA can also provide specific guidance on the acceptability of protocol design for clinical trials. The FDA, we or our partners may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to drug approval. During all clinical trials, physicians monitor the patients to determine effectiveness and to observe and report any reactions or other safety risks that may result from use of the drug. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, drug developers submit the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, to the FDA, in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the application unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will issue an approval letter if it determines that the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities are acceptable. If the FDA determines that the NDA, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will issue a complete response letter (CRL), in which it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We or our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us or our partners from marketing our products. Furthermore, the FDA may prevent a drug developer from marketing a drug under a label for its desired indications or place other conditions on distribution as a condition of any approvals, which may impair commercialization of the drug. After approval, some types of changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Similar regulatory procedures must also be followed within countries outside the U.S. 
 If the FDA approves the NDA, the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the U.S. After approval of our products, we have to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including delivering periodic reports to the FDA, submitting descriptions of any adverse reactions reported, and complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements. We and our partners also are required to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. Also, our quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP which imposes certain procedural and documentation requirements relating to quality assurance and quality control. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may require post market testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy, including additional studies, known as Phase IV trials, to evaluate long-term effects. 
 In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, we or our partners may have to conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved product for treatment of new indications, which require FDA approval. The purpose of these trials and studies is to broaden the application and use of the product and its acceptance in the medical community.

We use, and will continue to use, third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. 
 In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), was enacted into law, amending the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDAAA made a number of substantive and incremental changes to the review and approval processes in ways that could make it more difficult or costly to obtain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing pharmaceutical products. Most significantly, the law changed the FDAs handling of postmarked drug product safety issues by giving the FDA authority to require post approval studies or clinical trials, to request that safety information be provided in labeling, or to require an NDA applicant to submit and execute a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). 
 The FDAAA made certain changes to the user fee provisions to permit the use of user fee revenue to fund the FDAs drug product safety activities and the review of Direct-to-Consumer advertisements. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which became effective in October 2012, reauthorized the authority of the FDA to collect user fees to fund the FDAs review activities. 
 In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drugs listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired. 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug has expired. The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.

Foreign regulation 
 Whether or not we or our partners obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed by the applicable country, clinical trials conducted outside of the U.S. typically are administered with the three-Phase sequential process that is discussed above under United States government regulation. However, the foreign equivalent of an IND is not a prerequisite to performing pilot studies or Phase I clinical trials. 
 Under E.U. regulatory systems, we may submit Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is available for drugs produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. This authorization is a marketing authorization approval. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure. 
 In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our partners. 
 Patents and proprietary rights; Hatch-Waxman protection 
 We and our partners will be able to protect our products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our products are covered by valid and enforceable patents, either licensed in from third parties or generated internally, that give us or our partners sufficient proprietary rights. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. 
 HETLIOZ®, Fanapt®, tradipitant and VQW-765 are covered by new chemical entity and other patents and patent applications. In addition, new chemical entity patent protection has been requested for VTR-297 and CFTR and patent applications for the active ingredients in these products remain pending. For more on these license and sublicense arrangements, see License Agreements above. In addition, we have filed for patents based on our own discoveries that seek to provide additional protection for HETLIOZ® and Fanapt®. The primary new chemical entity patent covering Fanapt® expired in November 2016. 
 The table below is a summary of Orange Book listed patents for our commercial products. Members of these patent families are also issued or pending in a number of major market territories, such as Europe and Japan.

HETLIOZ®
Our rights to the new chemical entity patent covering HETLIOZ® and related intellectual property have been acquired through a license with BMS. HETLIOZ® and its formulations, genetic markers and uses are covered by a total of 14 patent and patent application families worldwide. The primary new chemical entity patent covering HETLIOZ® expires in December 2018 in the U.S. and expired in 2017 in most other markets. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of new chemical entity patents for a period of up to five years following the normal expiration of the patent covering that compound to compensate for time spent in development. We believe that HETLIOZ® will meet the various criteria of the Hatch-Waxman Act and will receive five additional years of patent protection in the U.S., which would extend its new chemical entity patent protection in the U.S. until 2022. An application for the five year patent term extension has been filed and is being processed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued six method of use patents for HETLIOZ® that will expire during 2033 and 2034. Both the new chemical entity patent and the method of use patents are listed in the Orange Book. 
 In Europe, the law provides for ten years of data exclusivity (with the potential for an additional year if the drug is developed for a significant new indication). As such, in Europe, data exclusivity will protect HETLIOZ® for at least ten years from approval. A completed Pediatric Investigation Plan could further extend this exclusivity for two years in an orphan indication, for a total of 12 years of exclusivity. It is also possible that the term of the new chemical entity patent in Europe could be extended by issuance of a supplementary protection certificate (SPC). The European Patent Office has granted our patent application directed to the 20 mg/day dose. This patent will expire normally in 2027. Patent applications directed to the treatment of Non-24, if granted, would provide exclusivity in Europe for this indication until at least 2033. 
 Outside the U.S. and Europe, data exclusivity will protect HETLIOZ® from generic competition for varying numbers of years depending on the country. 
 Additional patent applications directed to specific sleep disorders and to methods of treating patients with HETLIOZ®, if issued, would provide exclusivity for such indications and methods of treatment, potentially extending the effective patent protection period in the U.S., Europe, and other major markets. 
 Fanapt®
The new chemical entity patent for Fanapt®, which expired in 2016, is owned by Sanofi, and other patents and patent applications relating to Fanapt® previously owned by Novartis are now owned by Vanda. We originally obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the products covered by these patents through license and sublicense arrangements. Then, pursuant to an amended sublicense agreement with Novartis, Novartis retained exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of Fanapt® in the U.S. and Canada. However, as of December 2014, pursuant to an asset transfer agreement, we acquired all rights in Fanapt®, including in the U.S. and Canada. 
 Fanapt® and its metabolites, formulations, genetic markers and uses are covered by a total of 17 patent and patent application families in the U.S., Europe, and other markets. The primary new chemical entity patent covering Fanapt® expired in November 2016 in the U.S. and expired in 2010 in major markets outside the U.S. In November 2013, a patent directed to a method of treating patients with Fanapt® based on genotype was issued to us by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This patent, which was listed in the Orange Book in January 2015, is set to expire in 2027, potentially further extending the exclusivity protection of Fanapt®. Additional method of treatment patents were issued and listed in the Orange Book with the latest expected expiry in December 2031. See Note 16, Legal Matters, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 In Europe, the law provides for ten years of data exclusivity (with the potential for an additional year if the drug is developed for a significant new indication). No generic versions of Fanapt® would be permitted to be marketed or sold during this 10-year (or 11-year) period in most European countries. Outside the U.S. and Europe, data exclusivity will protect Fanapt® from generic competition for varying numbers of years depending upon the country. Several other patent applications covering metabolites, uses, formulations and genetic markers relating to Fanapt® extend beyond 2020. The patent family for the microsphere depot formulation of Fanapt® expires in 2024 in the U.S. and 2022 in most of the major markets in Europe. The patent family for the aqueous microcrystals depot formulation of Fanapt® expires in 2023 in the U.S. and in most of the major markets in Europe. 
 Tradipitant 
 Lilly owns a new chemical entity patent as well as patent applications directed to polymorphic forms of, and methods of making tradipitant. Thus, tradipitant is covered by a total of three patent and patent application families worldwide, which have been licensed to us. The new chemical entity patent covering tradipitant expires in 2023, except in the U.S., where it expires normally in 2024 subject to any extension that may be received under Hatch-Waxman. We have filed additional patent applications based on discoveries made during recent studies with tradipitant. 
 
13 
 
VQW-765
Novartis owns a new chemical entity patent as well as patent applications directed to methods of using VQW-765, VQW-765 formulations, and combinations of VQW-765 with other active pharmaceutical ingredients. The new chemical entity patent expires normally in 2023 in the U.S., Europe, and other markets. 
 VTR-297
VTR-297 is a small molecule HDAC inhibitor with potential use as a treatment for several oncology indications. We have pending patent applications covering the use of VTR-297 and plan on filing additional applications based on discoveries made throughout the development plan of this molecule. 
 Portfolio of CFTR activators and inhibitors 
 Our portfolio of CFTR activators and inhibitors may have broad applicability in addressing a number of high unmet medical needs, including chronic dry eye, constipation, polycystic kidney disease, cholestasis and secretory diarrheas. We plan on filing applications based on discoveries made throughout the development plan of these compounds. 
 Other Patents 
 Aside from the new chemical entity patents and other in-licensed patents relating to Fanapt®, HETLIOZ®, tradipitant and VQW-765, we have numerous patent and patent application families, most of which have been filed in key markets including the U.S., relating to our products and development compounds. In addition, we have several other patent application families relating to drugs not presently in clinical studies. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering other products, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. 
 Proprietary Know-how
For proprietary know-how that is not appropriate for patent protection, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our discovery process that involve proprietary know-how and technology that are not covered by patent applications, we generally rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, PPACA), has changed and is expected to further significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of PPACA became effective over various periods from 2010 through 2014. We cannot predict the complete impact of PPACA on pharmaceutical companies because many of PPACAs reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations to implement the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. While we cannot predict the complete impact on federal reimbursement policies this law will have in general or specifically on any product we commercialize, PPACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of new products. The rebates, discounts, taxes and other costs resulting from PPACA may have a significant effect on our profitability in the future. In addition, potential reductions of the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending under PPACA, could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products. Moreover, although the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of PPACA, some states have indicated that they intend not to implement certain sections of PPACA, and some members of the U.S. Congress are still working to repeal PPACA. We cannot predict whether these challenges will continue or other proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us or our partners. 
 In the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It will be time consuming and expensive for us or our partners to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us or our partners to sell our compounds on a competitive and profitable basis. The passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 imposes additional requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs which may affect the marketing of our products. 
 
14 
 
In many foreign markets, including the countries in the E.U. and Japan, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 HETLIOZ® was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Non-24 in January 2014 and commercially launched in the U.S. in April 2014. Additionally, HETLIOZ® was approved in the E.U. for the treatment of Non-24 in totally blind adults in July 2015. We commercially launched HETLIOZ® in Germany in August 2016. 
 Given the range of potential indications for HETLIOZ®, we may pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of HETLIOZ® worldwide. 
 Fanapt® was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia in May 2009 and commercially launched in the U.S. in January 2010. In October 2009, we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with Novartis pursuant to which Novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of Fanapt® in the U.S. and Canada. Novartis began selling Fanapt® in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010. Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement with Novartis, Novartis transferred all U.S. and Canadian rights in the Fanapt® franchise to Vanda on December 31, 2014. 
 Fanapt® was launched in Israel and Mexico by our distribution partners in 2014. As of December 31, 2017, we no longer have an active distributor relationship in Mexico. We continue to explore the regulatory path and commercial opportunity for Fanapt® oral formulation in other regions. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently utilize a virtual supply manufacturing and distribution chain in which we do not have our own facilities to manufacture commercial or clinical trial supplies of drugs and we do not have our own distribution facilities. Additionally, we do not intend to develop such facilities for any product in the near future. Instead, we contract with third parties for the manufacture, warehousing, order management, billing and collection and distribution of our products and product candidates. 
 We expect to continue to rely solely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture drug substance and final drug products for both clinical development and commercial sale. However, there are numerous factors that could cause interruptions in the supply of our products, including regulatory reviews, changes in our sources for manufacturing, disputes with a manufacturer, or financial instability of manufacturers, all of which could negatively impact our operation and our financial results. 
 We have agreements in place with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Patheon Inc. (collectively, Patheon), subsidiaries of Thermo Fisher Scientific, for the manufacture of HETLIOZ® and Fanapt®. 
 In January 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon for the manufacture of commercial supplies of HETLIOZ® 20 mg capsules at Patheons Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing site. Under the HETLIOZ® manufacturing agreement, we are responsible for supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredient for HETLIOZ® to Patheon and have agreed to certain minimum yearly order requirements. Patheon is responsible for manufacturing the HETLIOZ® 20 mg capsules, conducting quality control and stability testing, and packaging the HETLIOZ® capsules. The HETLIOZ® manufacturing agreement has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of one year each, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreement at least twelve months prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the HETLIOZ® manufacturing agreement under certain circumstances upon specified written notice to the other party. 
 As part of a settlement agreement, we assumed Novartis manufacturing agreement with Patheon for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Fanapt®. In May 2016, we entered into a new manufacturing agreement with Patheon for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Fanapt® 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mg tablets at Patheons Mississauga, Ontario, Canada manufacturing site. Under the Fanapt® manufacturing agreement, we are responsible for sourcing the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (iloperidone), and have agreed to order from Patheon at least 70% of the total yearly requirement of new units of Fanapt® tables for the U.S. and other specified countries each year for the term of the agreement. The Fanapt® manufacturing agreement has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of one year each, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreement at least twelve months prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the Fanapt® manufacturing agreement under certain circumstances upon specified written notice to the other party.

Research and Development 
 We have built a research and development organization that includes extensive expertise in the scientific disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. We use rigorous project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic research and development program decisions and to help limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles and, when appropriate, as we advance our programs towards commercialization. We engage third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research. In addition, we utilize multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials; however, we are not substantially dependent upon any one of these sites for our clinical trials nor do any of them conduct a major portion of our clinical trials. 
 Research and development expenses amounted to $38.5 million, $29.2 million and $29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Major Customers 
 Our revenues are generated from product sales and are concentrated with specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. There were six major customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues and, as a group, represented 95% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry, in particular, is highly competitive and includes a number of established large and mid-sized companies with greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have and significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our market segment also includes several smaller emerging companies whose activities are directly focused on our target markets and areas of expertise. Our products, once approved for commercial use, will compete with numerous therapeutic treatments offered by these competitors. While we believe that our products will have certain favorable features, existing and new treatments may also possess advantages. Additionally, the development of other drug technologies and methods of disease prevention are occurring at a rapid pace. These developments may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 We believe the primary competitors for HETLIOZ® and Fanapt® are as follows: 
 

 | For HETLIOZ® in the treatment of Non-24, there are no FDA approved direct competitors. Sedative-Hypnotic treatments for certain sleep related disorders include, Ambien® (zolpidem) by Sanofi (including Ambien CR®), Lunesta® (eszopiclone) by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sonata® (zaleplon) by Pfizer Inc., Rozerem® (ramelteon) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited, Silenor® (doxepin) by Pernix Therapeutics, Belsomra® (suvorexant) by Merck & Co., Inc., generic products such as zolpidem, trazodone and doxepin, and over-the-counter remedies such as Benadryl® and Tylenol PM®. The class of melatonin agonists includes Rozerem® (ramelteon) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited, Valdoxan® (agomelatine) by Servier, Circadin® (long-acting melatonin) by Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the food supplement melatonin. Shift work and excessive sleepiness disorder treatments include Nuvigil® (armodafinil) and Provigil® (modafinil) both by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

 Our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our ability to utilize our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics and drug development expertise to identify, develop, secure rights to and obtain regulatory approvals for promising pharmaceutical products before others are able to develop competitive products. Our ability to compete successfully will also depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. Additionally, our ability to compete may be affected because insurers and other third-party payors in some cases seek to encourage the use of cheaper, generic products, which could make our products less attractive.
