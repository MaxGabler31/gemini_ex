ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
On February 21, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with OWP Merger Subsidiary, Inc. (“OWP Merger Sub), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and OWP Ventures, Inc. (“OWP Ventures”). Under the Merger Agreement, the acquisition of OWP Ventures by us was effected by the merger of OWP Merger Sub with and into OWP Ventures, with OWP Ventures being the surviving entity as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). The closing (the “Closing”) of the Merger occurred on February 21, 2019.
 
Immediately prior to the Closing, we were a public “shell” company with nominal assets. As of the Closing, we are no longer a public shell. As a result of the Merger, we are engaged in OWP Ventures’ business, including the business of its wholly-owned subsidiary, One World Pharma, S.A.S., a Colombian company (“OWP Colombia”). On November 23, 2021, we changed our name from One World Pharma, Inc. to One World Products, Inc. through the merger of One World Products, Inc., a recently formed Nevada corporation wholly-owned by us, with and into us. This merger was effected solely to effect the change of our name, and had no effect on our officers, directors, operations, assets or liabilities. In this Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company” refers to One World Products, Inc. and its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, OWP Ventures and OWP Colombia.
 
On June 3, 2020, Isiah L. Thomas III was appointed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman. Mr. Thomas was a 12-time NBA All Star, two-time NBA champion, and is an accomplished international business executive. In 2021, through ISIAH International, LLC, of which he is the sole member, Mr. Thomas purchased $3,000,000 of our Series B Preferred Stock in installments over a period of time ending in July 2021.
 
We plan to be a producer of raw cannabis and hemp plant ingredients for both medical and industrial uses across the globe. We have received licenses from Colombian regulators to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes. Specifically, we are one of the first companies in Colombia to receive licenses for seed, cultivation, extraction and export from the Colombian government (the “Licenses”).
 
We planted our first crop of cannabis in Popayan, Colombia in 2018, and began initial harvesting in the first quarter of 2019 for the purpose of further research and development activities and quality control testing of the cannabis we have produced. We commenced limited shipping of non-psychoactive products to customers in May of 2020. Although we hold the four Colombian Licenses, we will need to obtain additional approvals from Colombian regulators before we can fully execute our business plan, particularly with respect to the sale psychoactive products. As described further under “Regulation” below,
 

● | We will need to obtain quota approvals from the Colombian authorities before we can commence commercial sale of our psychoactive products under our Cannabis Manufacturing License and Psychoactive Cultivation License;

● | We have successfully registered three non-psychoactive distinct cannabis strains and have received the certification required by Colombia’s National Registrar as of April 2020; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have been issued the sanitary registrations needed to sell our products intended for human consumption; and 
● | We have successfully registered eight psychoactive distinct cannabis strains and have received the certifications required by Columbia’s National Registrar as of December 2020; and 
● | We will proceed to get quota approvals for 2022. 

 
Our first cultivation site is located in Popayan, Colombia and our extraction facility will be located in the outskirts of Bogota, Colombia, in the town of Funza. Our cultivation facility encompasses approximately 30 acres and includes a covered greenhouse built specifically to cultivate high-grade cannabis and hemp. In addition, we have entered into agreements with local farming co-operatives that include small farmers and indigenous tribe members, under which they will cultivate cannabis on up to approximately 140 acres of land using our seeds and propagation techniques, and sell their harvested products to us on an exclusive basis.
 
We employ modern propagation and cultivation techniques drawn from U.S. practices that allow us to rapidly multiply the cells of a specific plant strain to produce large numbers of genetically consistent progeny plants using our own plant tissue culture method. We believe this technique allows us to cultivate plants which are stable, robust and able to produce genetically superior cannabis and hemp derived products. We intend to have our processes and products certified as compliant with international standards, including Good Agricultural Practices (“GAP”), Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) and the standards set forth in EU Pharmacopoeia, a publication that sets forth quality standards applicable to the European pharmaceutical industry.
 
We currently have 120,000 square feet of covered greenhouse capacity, which we intend to increase to 160,000 square feet. We are building out our extraction and production facility and expect it to be operational before the end of 2022. During the first quarter of 2022, we made payments of approximately $1,400,000 for a state of the art distillation machine that we expect to be placed in service within our vertically integrated extraction facility during the second quarter of 2022. Once the equipment is placed in service, we will be one of the only companies in Colombia to both hold licenses and possess the capability to extract high-quality CBD and THC oils. In addition, we have a contractual relationship with a local co-operative under which they agree to assist us in cultivation at our facility.
 
We have received full registrations from the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (the “ICA”) for the full registration of 3 non-psychoactive high CBD strains and 13 proprietary high THC cannabis strains. Only registered strains may be sold under Colombian law. We are now able to start the quota process, which is required in order to commercialize THC products. We believe we will receive a supplementary quota during 2022 that will allow us to sell THC products before year end 2022.
 
We believe there is a large and growing market for cannabis and hemp products around the world. The market for CBD has shown particular demand and growth. We will pursue sales into this market using a direct sales force to establish direct customer relationships and distributor relationships. We will seek out customers who have large and recurring needs and demands. Countries that we intend to focus on include EU countries, the UK, Poland, Israel, and Canada. We have commenced limited initial shipments of non-psychoactive products to customers in May of 2020. However, we remain subject to numerous risks that may affect or delay future sales, including regulatory requirements imposed or that may in the future be imposed by the Colombian regulating authorities. In addition, we will need to obtain quota approval from Colombian regulators before making we can make sales of our psychoactive products.
 
History and Background
 
One World Pharma S.A.S., is a Colombian company (“OWP Colombia”), incorporated on July 14, 2017 with the goal of procuring the following Colombian Licenses.
 
On December 20, 2017, the Colombian Ministry of Health, by means of resolution No. 5251 of 2017, granted OWP Colombia its license for the production of cannabis derivatives for domestic use and export, allowing OWP Colombia to extract high tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) compounds (“Cannabis Manufacturing License”). This license will expire on December 20, 2022.
 
On December 26, 2017, the Colombian Ministry of Justice, by means of resolution No. 1087 of 2017, granted OWP Colombia its license to use seeds for sowing for sale or delivery of seeds and/or for scientific research purposes, allowing for genetic and seed bank registration (“Cannabis Seed Possession License”). This license will expire on December 26, 2022.
 
On December 26, 2017, the Colombian Ministry of Justice, by means of resolution No. 1088 of 2017, granted OWP Colombia its license to grow non-psychoactive cannabis plants (less than 1.0% THC). Under this license, OWP Colombia can produce seeds for planting, deliver and make sales of the cannabis crop in order to produce cannabis derivatives and deliver and make sales of the cannabis crop for industrial purposes (“Cannabis Non-Psychoactive Cultivation License”). This license will expire on December 26, 2022.

On January 4, 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Justice, by means of resolution No. 0015 of 2018, granted OWP Colombia its license to grow psychoactive cannabis plants (greater than 1.0% THC) (“Psychoactive Cultivation License”). Under this license, OWP Colombia can produce seeds for planting, and deliver and make sales of the cannabis crop in order to produce cannabis derivatives. This license will expire on January 4, 2023.
 
Six months prior to the expiration of each of the Licenses, we can apply for successive renewals for additional five-year periods. In each renewal application, the corresponding Ministry will assess compliance with all the relevant requirements in determining whether or not to renew the License.
 
On March 27, 2018, OWP Ventures, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of acquiring OWP Colombia.
 
On May 30, 2018, OWP Ventures entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the shareholders of OWP Colombia whereby the shareholders of OWP Colombia transferred their shares in OWP Colombia to OWP Ventures in exchange for 10,200,000 shares of common stock of OWP Ventures.
 
Products
 
We are focused on cultivating, processing and supplying crude cannabis oil, distillate and isolate to customers’ specification. We plan to sell as a wholesaler to industrial companies making cannabis related products. We also plan on supplying the hemp plant bio-mass remaining after our extraction process to industry participants that utilize hemp in the manufacture of their products. Hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products, including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation and biofuel.
 
We are currently in the process of cultivating medicinal cannabis at our facility in Popayan, Colombia for a variety of medical conditions. We have registered 25 varieties or strains of cannabis with the Colombian Ministry of Health. See “Strains of Cannabis” below. The development of these strains enables us to select mother plants and identify the concentrations of cannabinoids required for the products which we intend to distribute. The cannabis will be produced in accordance with GMP Standards. We are committed to developing final products consistent with medicinal cannabis industry standards and pharmaceutical procedures. Our products will include a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes designed to address specific medical conditions. The composition of the strains will include a wide range of THC and CBD ratios.
 
Industry
 
Medicinal cannabis refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids and terpenes to treat disease or ameliorate symptoms such as pain, muscle spasticity, nausea and other indications. Cannabinoid is a blanket term covering a family of complex chemicals, both natural and man-made, that bind with cannabinoid receptors (protein molecules on the surface of cells) and effect a wide number of responses. Cannabinoid receptors in the human body are part of a system called the endocannabinoid system. This system produces chemicals called endocannabinoids, which also bind with cannabinoid receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are found in the brain and throughout the body. Scientists have found that cannabinoid receptors in the endocannabinoid system are involved in a vast array of functions in our bodies, including helping to modulate brain and nerve activity (including memory and pain), energy metabolism, heart function, the immune system and even reproduction. While there are a large number of active cannabinoids found in cannabis, the two most common currently used for medical purposes are tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. Although no clinical trials have been completed in the United States to validate the effectiveness of tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol in managing disease and improving symptoms, scientific studies have identified that they, alone and/or in combination, may potentially provide treatment benefits for a large number of medical conditions. For example, tetrahydrocannabinol, a psychotropic cannabinoid, has been shown to activate pathways in the central nervous system which work to block pain signals and has shown potential to assist patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and stimulate appetite in patients following chemotherapy. Cannabidiol, on the other hand, is non-psychotropic and has shown potential to relieve convulsion and inflammation, and is the active ingredient in Epidolex, which in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy.
Regulation
 
Our active business operations are currently conducted solely within Colombia, and as such, the discussion below is limited to Colombian laws and regulations applicable to our business, which require us to hold the relevant licenses, quotas and other permits, as described below. Our activities in the United States consist solely of corporate administrative activities at our Las Vegas headquarters, including accounting, finance and SEC compliance functions. We believe that our current activities in the United States will not subject us to regulation under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act or other applicable U.S. federal or state laws with respect to our proposed business plans. All export activities will be conducted from Colombia, and we do not intend to export any of our products to jurisdictions where such sales are not legal under local law. Accordingly, we do not currently intend to export our products to the United States to the extent such products may be subject to regulation under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act or other applicable U.S. federal or state regulations.

Regulatory Authorities
 
Several authorities interact in the Colombian cannabis industry. The Ministry of Health is in charge of granting the Cannabis Manufacturing and Distribution License and exercises administrative control over the production of cannabis derivatives. The Ministry of Justice, through the subsection for the Control and Supervision of Chemical Substances and Narcotic Drugs, is the competent authority for issuing the Cannabis Seeds Possession License, the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License and the Cannabis Non-Psychoactive Cultivation License and for exercising administrative control over cannabis operations and cultivation. The National Narcotics Fund (“FNE”) exercises administrative and operational control over activities related to the management of psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis and its derivatives. The National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute (“INVIMA”) is in charge of issuing and monitoring compliance under the health and phytosanitary registrations that may be applicable to products containing cannabis derivatives. The Colombian Agricultural Institute (“ICA”) is responsible for maintaining the registry of the Genetic Pool or ¨Fuente Semillera” and the registration of cannabis seeds and strains under the “Registro Nacional de Cultivares Comerciales”.
 
In exercising the administrative and operational control activities discussed above the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, ICA and FNE are required to coordinate their activities to the extent necessary, according to their competencies, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development through ICA, as well as with the National Police.
 
Licenses
 
Under Colombian law, there are four types of cannabis licenses that authorize different activities concerning the various stages of the production line of the medical cannabis industry: (i) the Cannabis Seeds Possession License; which is required for the domestic sale and delivery of seeds (but not export) and for scientific research purposes; (ii) the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License, which is required for the production of seeds for sowing; for grain production; production of cannabis derivatives; for scientific research purposes, for storage, and for final disposal; (iii) the Cannabis Non-Psychoactive Cultivation License, which is required for the production of grain and seeds for sowing; production of cannabis derivatives; for industrial purposes; for scientific research purposes; for storage; and for final disposal; and (iv) the Cannabis Manufacturing and Distribution License, which is required for the production of cannabis derivatives for domestic use; production of cannabis derivatives for scientific research purposes; and production of cannabis derivatives for exportation. OWP Colombia holds all of these licenses.
 
The legal framework currently in force in Colombia regarding medical cannabis is established in Law 1787 of 2016 (the “Law”) and the Decree 613 of 2017 (the “Decree”). Cannabis licenses must be issued by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Justice in an estimated time of 60 days, however, in practice, this process can take between four and six months. In accordance with Colombia’s international obligations, there is a limit in the amount of Cannabis allowed for fabrication or cultivation assigned by the Colombian Government (specific crop or manufacturing quotas) that must be requested by each licensee when applying for a Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License or a Cannabis Manufacturing License. The activities of cultivation and manufacturing can only be started once the specific quotas have been granted to the licensee.
 
Duration of Licenses
 
The Cannabis Seeds Possession License, the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License, the Cannabis Non-Psychoactive License, and the Cannabis Manufacturing and Distribution License are granted by the Ministry of Justice and/or the Ministry of Health (as applicable), when the applicant fulfills the general criteria described in Article 2.8.11.2.1.5 of the Decree, and the specific requirements for each type of license. Each of these licenses is valid for up to five years. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health (as applicable) maintain the right to monitor the activities performed by the corresponding licensee, and in the event of a breach by the licensee of the obligations and duties set forth in the Decree, the licenses may be revoked. The relevant Ministry may renew these licenses for additional and successive five-year periods. In each renewal application, the Ministry will assess compliance with all the relevant requirements in determining whether or not to renew the license.
Quotas
 
As described above, regulations of cannabis in Colombia provides an additional requirement applicable to the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License and Cannabis Manufacturing License, which require the grant of crop and manufacturing quotas (the “Quotas”). According to Article 2.8.11.2.6.2 of the Decree, the assignment of Quotas is collectively made by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, the ICA, the INVIMA, and the FNE.

According to Article 2.8.11.2.6.5 of the Decree, there are two types of Quotas: (i) crop quotas for psychoactive cannabis (for holders of the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License) which are granted by the Ministry of Justice; and (ii) the manufacturing quotas for psychoactive cannabis (for holders of the Cannabis Manufacturing License) which are granted by the Ministry of Health.
 
These Quotas are requested by the licensees no later than the last calendar day of April of each year, and, if they are granted by the corresponding authority, they can only be used by the licensees during the next calendar year (for instance, if a licensee requests a specific crop Quota in March, 2018, and this Quota is granted by the Ministry of Justice, the licensee will be allowed to use the Quota from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019). In extraordinary events, the licensees can request a supplementary Quota that will apply to the calendar year requested (the issuance of these Quotas depends on the special circumstances defined by the Colombian governmental authorities).
 
On December 3, 2018, by means of resolution 1256 of 2018, Colombia´s Ministry of Justice granted OWP Colombia a supplementary Quota for growing psychoactive mother plants; six for each of 13 varieties, for a total of 78 “mother” plants. However, before we commence the commercial sale of our psychoactive products (greater than 1% THC content), we will need to obtain Quotas from the Ministry of Health. This will require us to conduct successful agricultural characterization tests approved by and registered with the ICA/Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and stabilized extracts characterization tests approved by INVIMA/Ministry of Health, of product samples grown by us under Quotas obtained from the Ministry of Justice. We have already requested from the Ministry of Health and Justice our annual Quotas for the export sale of psychoactive ingredients in 2022, and are awaiting the issuance of such Quotas in order to start our production process.
 
Strains of Cannabis
 
Strains of cannabis are registered in Colombia in two manners:
 

● | Registration of the Genetic Pool or “Fuente Semillera”: Under Article 2.8.11.11.1 of the Decree, licensed producers of cannabis had until December 31, 2018 to register the genetics of strains of cannabis with the ICA. Under this transitory article, the government allowed a limited period for licensed producers of cannabis to source genetics currently available in Colombia and register these as their “fuente semillera”. We registered 25 varieties under this article. This registration enables us to grow our own strains of cannabis as opposed to having to purchase registered strains from other licensed producers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Registration Under the “Registro Nacional de Cultivares Comerciales”: Licensed producers of cannabis have to be granted a breeding/research license to be able to develop, select and trial stabilized cannabis cultivars. This registration allows licensed producers to register unique and stable varieties of cannabis for commercial production within Colombia. We were granted such license in the first quarter of 2018. Licensed producers can then request from ICA a registration trial, which is a field flowering trial with the supervision of ICA officials. The data collected in these trials can lead to registration of the cultivar in the National Registrar. Only registered varieties will be allowed to be produced commercially. We have received full registration for 3 non-psychoactive high CBD strains which have been approved for sale. We have also received permission to take 13 psychoactive THC strains through this process and anticipate the completion of such by year end 2021. 

Sanitary Registration
 
The commercialization of cannabis-based finished products intended for human consumption requires the issuance of sanitary registrations by the INVIMA, and in the case of products intended for animal consumption, by the ICA.
Environmental
 
Under Colombian law, general principles of environmental law are set out in Law 99 of 1993 and Article 9 of the National Code of Natural Resources and Protection of the Environment. These laws establish principles governing the use of natural resources, including that use must occur without causing harm to the interests of the community or of third parties. Parties that cause environmental damage while acting under the authority of a permit are responsible for incurring the costs to rectify the damage. The imposition of environmental sanctions is in addition to civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed. Environmental damage caused while a party is acting without a license constitutes a breach of Law 99 of 1993 and may lead to the imposition of sanctions, in addition to civil or criminal proceedings that may result. Parties that cause environmental damage, in addition to sanctions or penalties that apply, will also be required to carry out studies to assess the characteristics of the damage. Under Colombian law, liability for environmental damage creates a presumption of liability in case of a: (i) breach of environmental laws; (ii) environmental damage; and (iii) breach of environmental license or any other administrative act from the environmental authorities. The Environmental Authorities may investigate potential claims, authorize preventative measures, or impose sanctions on parties breaching environmental law.

Competition
 
The market for medicinal cannabis is characterized by unsatisfied patient demand, with few authorized producers. Although competition in the market is growing and Colombia offers an open process to apply for the licenses, we believe we are competitively positioned to satisfy the demand for medicinal cannabis given our early entry into the market, the management team’s expertise in medical product branding, marketing, quality control and domestic market relationships. In addition, the Colombian government has published for comment a draft decree that requires any applicant for any of the four Licenses to furnish evidence that it has completed the seed registration process before the ICA and obtained the corresponding technical sheet for the cannabis plants and varieties. If enacted, this new regulation will result in stricter requirements on potential competitors seeking a Colombian License.
 
Cultivation in Colombia has natural cost advantages. However, management believes the more sustainable competitive advantage is to create patient loyalty and brand preference, as opposed to the distribution of more homogeneous products. Domestically our competition consists of PharmaCielo, CannaVida, Empresa Colombiana de Cannabis, Khiron Life Sciences Corp., MedCan, Canopy Growth Corporation, and Clever Leaves.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
Seasonality
 
Colombia and its vertical offering of microclimates is the ideal country for year-round growing and processing of all possible varieties of cannabis in a natural, environmentally friendly manner.
Principal Executive Offices
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 3471 West Oquendo Road, Suite 301, Las Vegas Nevada 89118. Our telephone number is (800) 605-3210. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current and near-term needs.
Employees
 
As of April 5, 2022, we had 31 full-time employees. Since inception, we have never had a work stoppage, other than due to the Covid-19 quarantine from March 2020 through May 25, 2020, and our employees are not represented by labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive.
