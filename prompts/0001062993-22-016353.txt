(a Nevada Corporation), and Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona Limited Liability Company), unless otherwise specified.
 Corporate Overview
 Founded in 2012, The Alkaline Water Company (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Its flagship product, Alkaline88®, is a leading premier alkaline water brand available in bulk and single-serve sizes along with eco-friendly aluminum packaging options. With its innovative, state-of-the-art proprietary electrolysis process, Alkaline88® delivers perfect 8.8 pH balanced alkaline drinking water with trace minerals and electrolytes and boasts our trademarked label 'Clean Beverage.' Quickly being recognized as a growing lifestyle brand, we launched A88 Infused Beverage Division Inc., which includes our CBD water and Alkaline88® Sports Drinks. Our hemp-derived CBD water products are produced and sold in compliance with the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, Public Law 115-334).
 Our bottled alkaline water product is presently available in over 75,000 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Caribbean and in Mexico and Canada. We distribute our product through several channels. We sell through large national distributors (UNFI, KeHE, C&S, and Core-Mark), which together represent over 150,000 retail outlets. We also sell our products directly to retail clients, including convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers and through Direct Store Distributors in selected markets, including Columbia Distributing, Mahaska, Nevada Beverage, and Hensley, covering Nevada, Arizona, Pacific Northwest and Midwest region. Combined, they service over 25,000 customers in eight states. Each one carries our full line of non-CBD waters. Some examples of retail clients are: Walmart, CVS, Rite-Aid, Family Dollar, Food Lion, Albertson's/Safeway, Kroger companies, Sam's Club, Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas', Stater Bros. Markets, Unified Grocers, Bristol Farms, Publix, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Ingles, Shaw's, Raley's, Harris Teeter, Festival Foods, HEB and Brookshire's. The majority of our sales to retail clients are through brokers and distributors, however, sales to our larger retail clients are often direct to the client's own warehouse distribution network. Our full line of Alkaline88® bottled water products and sports drinks are presently available for purchase at www.alkaline88.com and www.thealkalinewaterco.com. Our CBD water products are presently available for purchase on our CBD E-commerce website, www.a88cbd.com, in addition to a growing number of brick and mortar retail locations.
 Our operating subsidiary, Alkaline 88, LLC, operates primarily as a marketing, distribution, and manufacturing company for our alkaline bottled water products. It has entered into co-packing agreements with nine different bottling companies located in Virginia, Georgia, California, Texas, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona to act as co-packers for our product. Our current capacity at all plants exceeds approximately $14.0 million per month wholesale.
 Our component materials are readily available through multiple vendors. Our principal suppliers are Vav Plastics Inc., Amcor Inc., Smurfit, and Goodpac.
 A88 Infused Products, Inc.
 In September 2019, we formed A88 Infused Products, Inc., or "A88 Products," a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. A88 Product's focus is brand extension and product innovations in the CBD infused products category. We formed A88 Products to meet what we believe is increasing consumer demand for a variety of CBD infused beverage products. During our fiscal year 2022, A88 Products began selling its line of Alkaline88®CBD infused bottled water through ecommerce at www.a88cbd.com. Currently, A88 Products' Alkaline88®CBD infused bottled water products are available for purchase on its E-commerce website, www.a88cbd.com, various third party ecommerce sites, and a growing number of brick and mortar retail locations throughout the United States. As of the date of this annual report, the FDA has not made a determination that the use of hemp extract in food is safe. The FDA has evaluated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notices for four hemp seed-derived food ingredients and determined that the agency has no questions that those ingredients are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. We currently produce Alkaline88® CBD infused bottled water as a low calorie hemp extract-infused water in five flavors and 5 functional formulas (Resistance, Rest, Relax, Refresh, and Reenergize). We may change the composition of our planned hemp-extract-infused product as necessary to comply with federal, state or local laws, regulations or guidance.
Plan of Operations
 In order for us to implement our business plan over the next 12 months, we have identified the following milestones that we expect to achieve:
 Expansion of Broker Network - We expect to continue to develop our working relationship with our national retail broker network. We continually meet, train, and go on sales call with our national retail broker network in order to take advantage of the momentum currently being created by their efforts and sell into clubs stores and big box retailers. New brokers will also be added in the on-premise and international sales channels to support initiatives that began in Fiscal 2021. We anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing expenses to be incurred as part of this expansion.
 Strategically Located DSD Partners - We expect to add Direct Store Distributors ("DSD") partners in the Northeast, Northwest and Mid-Atlantic to further accelerate our retail account penetration, specifically in the convenience store channel.
 Increase Manufacturing Capacity - (i) Flagship Alkaline88® product: we expect to add three new co-packer facilities, strategically located to reduce freight costs and meet current volumes and future growth objectives; and (ii) A88 Infused: we expect to add one to three new co-packer facilities strategically located to meet anticipated volumes by product type and future growth objectives.
 Expand Retail Distribution - We continue to expand our retail presence through securing new customers and growing the number of SKUs of our products carried by existing customers.
 Expand On-Premise Distribution - In addition to adding qualified personnel to lead this area we will be bringing on numerous new brokers and distributors to support our on-premise channels which include, hotels, national parks, airports, universities, restaurants, resorts, health clubs, recreation and other on-premise facilities and businesses
 Expand International Distribution - We anticipate adding new brokers, distributors and co-packers to support our international sales initiatives in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and potential parts of Asia
 Addition of Support Staff and Officers- In order to support expansion efforts and to continue the training and support of our broker network, we anticipate that we will need to hire approximately three to five more people on the corporate level for the specific purpose of supporting hospitality/on-premise sales and DSD sales. We continue to seek and interview candidates to fill our growing need for additional staffing
 Capital Considerations - Our business plan can be adjusted based on the available capital to the business.
 • On February 22, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as sales agent (the "Agent"), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to the Agent, as sales agent and/or principal (the "Offering") up to $20,000,000 in shares of our common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, the Agent agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares from time to time, based upon our instructions. Under the Sales Agreement, the Agent may sell the shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at the market offering" as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares and may at any time suspend offers under the Sales Agreement. The Offering will terminate upon (a) the election of the Agent upon the occurrence of certain adverse events, (b) five days' advance notice from one party to the other, or (c) the sale of all of the shares specified in the Sales Agreement. Under the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to a commission at a fixed rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale of the shares under the Sales Agreement. We will also reimburse the Agent for certain expenses incurred in connection with the Sales Agreement. As of March 31, 2022, we sold a total of 281,459 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $260,844 through the Agent under the Sales Agreement. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, we sold a total of 750,240 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $631.203 through the Agent under the Sales Agreement.

• The Company’s ability to operating as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until the Company becomes profitable.  The Company has initiated a cost-reduction strategy along with its  cash on hand, plus anticipated warrant exercises and debt settlements, our line of credit and the Sales Agreement is planned to fund our current planned operations and capital needs. However, if our current plans change or are accelerated or we choose to increase our production capacity, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, including seeking investments from strategic investors. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.
 The milestones set forth above reflect our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business. Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein.
 Distribution Method for Our Products
 Our distribution network is a broker-distributor-retailer network, whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers. Our target retail markets are: (a) chain and independent health food stores; (b) grocery stores; (c) convenience stores; (d) drug stores; and (e) the mass retail market. We are also adding certain DSD distribution partners in certain strategic markets throughout the United States to assist in our retail account penetration, specifically in the convenience store channel.
 Through common carriers we ship our water to distribution centers (DC) around the country. We distribute to the natural food channel by delivering to primarily KeHE and UNFI distributors who then deliver to specific store locations within their customer networks. Combined, they reach over 60,000 retailers nationwide. The convenience channel is served by Core-Mark, McLane, and select market DSDs that service 110,000 retailers.
 We deliver directly to the DCs of our large national and regional grocery, drug, and specialty retailers. These retailers include Walmart, Sam's Club, CVS, Family Dollar, Albertson's/Safeway, Kroger companies, and regional grocery chains such as Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas', Bristol Farms, Stater Brothers, Unified Grocers, Publix, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Ingles, Shaw's, Raley's Harris Teeter, Festival Foods, Brookshire's, HEB and other companies throughout the United States. In total we are now in more than 70% of the top 75 grocery retailers in the United States.
 Dependence on Few Customers
 We have 3 major customers that together account for 43% (19%, 12% and 12%, respectively) of accounts receivable at March 31, 2022, and 2 customers that together account for 34% (19% and 15%, respectively) of the total revenues earned for the year ended March 31, 2022.
 There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Marketing
 We intend to continue to market our product through our broker network and to avail ourselves to the promotional activities of other companies and competitors regarding the benefits of alkaline water. We anticipate that our initial marketing thrust will be to support the retailers and distribution network with point of sales displays and other marketing materials, strategically adding an extensive public relations program and other marketing as the markets dictate.
 We have hired a chief marketing officer and built an entire in house marketing team to lead our company in all aspects of our marketing, trade promotion, public relations and brand development. Their expertise in all aspects of consumer goods brand development and marketing is expected to help us meet the growing consumer demand for both our flagship Alkaline88® product and our Alkaline88®CBD product line.
Competition
 The commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital.
 We compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as: CORE® Hydration, SOBE®, Snapple®, AriZona® Iced Tea, Vitaminwater®, Gatorade Perform®, and POWERADE®.
 We compete indirectly with major international beverage companies including but not limited to: The Coca-Cola Company®, PepsiCo, Inc., The Nestlé Group, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc, Danone S.A., The Kraft Heinz Company, and Unilever PLC. These companies have established market presence in the United States and globally, and offer a variety of beverages that are competitors to our products. We face potential direct competition from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter the alkaline water market.
 We will compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including Eternal, Essentia, Core, Icelandic, Real Water, AQUAHydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $0.99 for a half-liter bottle to $4.99 for a one-gallon bottle, and volumes ranging from half-liter bottles to one-gallon bottles. We currently offer our product in a one-gallon bottle for a suggested resale price or a SRP of $4.99, three-liter bottle for a SRP of $3.99, 2 liter bottle at a SRP of $2.99, 1.5 liter at a SRP of $2.49, 1 liter at a SRP of $1.99, 700 milliliter single serving at a SRP of $1.19, an aluminum 500ml at a SRP of $2.49, and a 500 milliliter at a SRP of $0.99. Our competitors may introduce larger sizes and offer them at an SRP that is lower than our products. We can provide no assurances that consumers will continue to purchase our products or that they will not prefer to purchase a competitive product.
 The CBD and hemp extract market is extremely competitive and constantly evolving. We face competition from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar CBD and hemp products to our company. We face potential direct competition from Charlotte's Web Holdings Inc., PureKana, and cbdMD.
 Intellectual Property
 Where available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. The trademark for Alkaline88® has been registered in the USA, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom and Hong Kong.

Other trademarks that have been registered and are currently being used in our marketing efforts include Clean Beverage®, Smooth Hydration®, Ionized H20®, A88®, Hello Hydration®, and A88 Infused.®
 Any third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 Employees
 In addition to Frank Lazaran, who is our president, chief executive officer and director, and David A. Guarino, who is our chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and director, we currently employ 43 full time employees and 2 part-time employees. We also work with retail brokers in the United States who are paid on a contract basis. Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management's relationships with manufacturers, distillers, development/research companies, bottling concerns, and certain retail customers will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks. We also plan to form an independent network of contract sales and regional managers, a promotional support team, and several market segment specialists who will be paid on a variable basis.
