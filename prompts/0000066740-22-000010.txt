Distribution
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.

Resources
Human Capital
On December 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 95,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 38,000 employed in the United States and 57,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3M’s success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.
Health and Safety
3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits.
Development
Developing employees contributes to growing 3M’s business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the Company’s chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company has a suite of high-potential leadership development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3M also has development programs for managers and supervisors and provides learning opportunities for all employees, in addition to regular coaching and support from their supervisor. With the Company’s global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the Company’s diversity with underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates.
Compensation and Benefits
3M has a trust-based approach to work that empowers employees to work where and when they can best achieve their goals, which supports attraction and retention of talent around the globe. In addition to a professional and flexible work environment that promotes innovation, well-being, and rewards performance, 3M’s total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.
Raw Materials
In 2021, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused imbalances within global supply markets. As markets re-opened and demand increased following COVID lockdowns, the Company experienced raw material price inflation and constrained supply. Multiple weather, logistics and other disruptive events worsened global supply chain imbalances and contributed to higher costs. 
Table of Contents

The Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material price inflation in 2021. To help manage disruption to its manufacturing operations, 3M deploys careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, as well as qualification of additional supply sources. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
The Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
Government Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance
The Company’s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
In 2021, 3M expended approximately $157 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $668 million for 2022 and 2023 in aggregate.
Although an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Following is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there any undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

Item 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M’s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments (see Note 19 for additional details). 
Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
Corporate and Unallocated:
In addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes “special items” and “other corporate expense-net”. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products/businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other 
Table of Contents

corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily related to the pre-tax gain of $387 million included in special items in 2020 as a result of 3M's divestiture of its drug delivery business (see Note 3 for additional details). 
Special Items
Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section and Note 5 for additional details on the impact of significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions that are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.
Other Corporate Expense - Net
Other corporate operating expenses decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $91 million pre-tax benefit from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court in the second quarter of 2021 regarding the calculation of past social taxes, continued lower overall corporate staff spending and first quarter 2020 charges related to equity securities (as discussed in the “Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis” section of Note 15), partially offset by increased legal and reserve adjustment costs.
Operating Business Segments:
Information related to 3M’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables. 
The following discusses total year results for 2021 compared to 2020 and 2020 compared to 2019 for each business segment. 
Safety and Industrial Business (36.4% of consolidated sales):

Year 2021 results:
Sales in Safety and Industrial were up 9.8 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, electrical markets, roofing granules, and closure and masking systems and decreased in personal safety year-on-year.
•Growth was driven by improving general industrial manufacturing activity and other end-market demand partially offset by prior-year strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand.
Table of Contents

Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to increases in raw materials, logistics and litigation-related costs; lower gain on sale of properties; and manufacturing productivity impacts that were partially offset by sales growth leverage, lower year-on-year respirator mask reserve increases, and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.
Year 2020 results:
Sales in Safety and Industrial were up 2.1 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in personal safety and roofing granules, while industrial adhesives and tapes, electrical markets, closure and masking systems, automotive aftermarket, and abrasives sales decreased year-on-year.
•Strong growth related to unprecedented demand for respirators as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was partially offset by softness that impacted sales growth across most of the Company’s general industrial-related portfolio.
Divestitures:
•2019 divestitures that impacted 2020 results relate to the August 2019 sale of the gas and flame detection business.
Business segment operating income margins increased 3.0% year-on-year primarily related to strong productivity, continued cost discipline and benefits from certain property sale, 2019 restructuring and other actions.
Transportation and Electronics Business (27.6% of consolidated sales):

Year 2021 results: 
Sales in Transportation and Electronics were up 10.6 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in advanced materials, commercial solutions, automotive and aerospace, electronics and transportation safety. 
•Sales increased in automotive and aerospace from improving automotive-end market activity and increases in car and light truck builds, partially offset by impacts from semiconductor supply chain constraints.
•Sales increased in electronics due to strong demand in data center, semiconductor, interconnect and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by impacts from semiconductor supply chain constraints.
•Sales increased in commercial solutions, advanced materials and transportation safety due to increased advertising spend and return to workplace trends.
Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage, benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges, and COVID impacts recognized on certain assets in 2020 that were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs.
Table of Contents

Year 2020 results:
Sales in Transportation and Electronics were down 7.9 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in electronics, while sales decreased in transportation safety, advanced materials, commercial solutions and automotive and aerospace. 
•Electronics-related growth was led by demand for semiconductor, data center, and factory automation end-markets, and was partially offset by softness in the consumer electronics end-market.
•Automotive and aerospace was primarily impacted by the decline in global car and light truck builds. Commercial solutions and transportation safety were impacted by soft-end markets such as hospitality, advertising and highway infrastructure due to social distancing and work-from-home protocols as a result of COVID-19.
Divestitures:
•In January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business. Refer to Note 3 for details.
Business segment operating income margins decreased 1.6%, primarily related to lower sales and reduced productivity in key end-markets due to COVID-19 related impacts, partially offset by continued cost discipline and benefits from 2019 restructuring actions.

Year 2021 results:
Sales in Health Care were up 8.4 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in oral care, separation and purification, food safety, health information systems and medical solutions. 
•Sales increased in oral care driven by higher year-on-year dental procedures and in separation and purification from continued high demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic development and manufacturing.
•Sales increased in medical solutions from rising elective procedure volumes in the first six months of 2021 and strong respirator demand in the first quarter of 2021.
•Sales increased in health information systems due to improving hospital information technology investments.
Divestitures:
•In May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.
Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges that were partially offset by supply chain disruptions, increases in raw materials

and logistics costs, deal-related costs associated with the announced divestiture of the food safety business (see Note 3), manufacturing productivity impacts, increased compensation and benefit costs, and increased investments in growth.
Year 2020 results:
Sales in Health Care were up 12.3 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in medical solutions, separation and purification, and food safety, while sales decreased in health information systems and oral care.
•Increases in healthcare volumes benefited both medical solutions and oral care after significant disruptions in the second quarter, with strong pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators resulting in increased sales for medical solutions, while oral care sales decreased year-on-year. In addition, health information systems decreased due to hospitals remaining cautious relative to their information technology investments.
Acquisitions:
•In February 2019, 3M acquired M*Modal, a leading healthcare technology provider of cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient narrative.
•In October 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of Acelity Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, a leading global medical technology company focused on advanced wound care and specialty surgical applications.
Divestitures:
•In the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business.
•In May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.
Business segment operating income margins decreased 2.7% year-on-year, driven by impacts related to the Acelity acquisition in addition to significant sales declines in oral care during the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by continued cost discipline and benefits from 2019 restructuring and other costs.

Year 2021 results:
Sales in Consumer were up 10.3 percent in U.S. dollars.
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in stationery and office, home improvement, consumer health and safety, and home care.
•Sales increased in home improvement driven by continued strength in the market with strong demand for CommandTM adhesives, FiltreteTM air quality solutions, MeguiarsTM auto care and Scotch BlueTM painter’s tape. 
•Sales increased in stationery and office from ongoing strength in demand for packaging and shipping products, Post-it®-solutions and Scotch® brand office tapes as the business laps last year’s COVID-related comparisons.
Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as a result of increases in raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs that more than offset leverage from sales growth and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.

Year 2020 results:
Sales in Consumer were up 3.5 percent in U.S. dollars. 
On an organic sales basis:
•Sales increased in home improvement and home care, while consumer health and safety and stationery and office decreased.
•Stationery and office declined year-on-year as a result of many business offices and schools remaining partially or fully closed due to the pandemic.
•Sales showed continued strength in the Company’s Command™, Filtrete™, Scotch Blue™, Scotch Brite™, and Meguiars™ brands.
Business segment operating income margins increased 1.6% year-on-year as a result of strong organic sales growth and continued cost discipline.
PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 2 and Note 19.
Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

Employment:
Employment remained consistent in 2021 when compared to 2020. The above table includes the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures and other actions.
Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.
Table of Contents

The Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
Legal Proceedings:
Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, Contingencies. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
The Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. The below further describes these estimates. Note 13 provides the weighted averages of these assumptions as of applicable dates and for respective periods and additional information on how the rates were determined. 
Discount rate
The defined benefit pension and postretirement obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty. 
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

 | U.S. Qualified Pension | | International Pension (weighted average) | | U.S. Postretirement Medical
December 31, 2021 Liability: | | | | | 
Benefit obligation | 2.89 | % | | 1.80 | % | 2.75 | %
2022 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components: | | | | | 
Service cost | 3.12 | % | | 1.64 | % | 3.02 | %
Interest cost | 2.39 | % | | 1.62 | % | 2.20 | %

Expected return on plan assets
The expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2022 is 6.00%, a decrease from 6.50% in 2021. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 3.86% for 2022 compared to 4.36% for 2021. Changes in asset allocation and market performance over time, among other factors, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $503 million and a benefit of $297 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $206 million, down from $322 million in 2020.
Table of Contents

In 2022, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $435 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $250 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $185 million, a decrease of approximately $20 million compared to 2021.
The table below summarizes the impact on 2022 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2021 net periodic benefit cost. The table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves.

Goodwill and Certain Long-Lived Assets:
The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. Those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in impairment assessments of goodwill.
Acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets
In conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized. Changes in factors that may impact projected future cash flows, discount rates, customer preferences, and other estimates above, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other items, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.
Assessments of goodwill
As of December 31, 2021, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.5 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.
Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. Where applicable, the discounted cash flow analysis uses projected cash flows that are based on sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2021, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an assessment indicating no resulting goodwill impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates 
Table of Contents

to the separate fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2021, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2021, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses.
3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2022 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2021, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.
Total Debt:
The strength of 3M’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor’s.
Table of Contents

The Company’s total debt was lower at December 31, 2021 when compared to December 31, 2020. Decreases in debt are further described in Note 12 and were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption via make-whole call offers of $450 million in debt and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section. As discussed in Note 12, during the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps that converted part of the Company’s $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR’s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA stated it will cease publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that do not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023.The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate and these agreements contain relevant fallback language. The Company’s analysis of its other commercial contracts found that such contracts, as a general practice, do not reference LIBOR. 3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period.
Effective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.
As of December 31, 2021, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Additionally, the August 2019 and March 2020 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented and credit facilities is included in Note 12.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
At December 31, 2021, 3M had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.7 billion was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2020, 3M had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the United States. The decrease from December 31, 2020 resulted from higher share repurchases of treasury stock, the March 2021 early redemption via make-whole call offers of $450 million in debt, and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount, partially offset by strong cash flow from operations.
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

 | December 31, | | Change
(Millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Total debt | $ | 17,363 | | | $ | 18,795 | | $ | (1,432)

Balance Sheet:
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.
Working Capital (non-GAAP measure):

 | December 31, | | Change
(Millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Current assets | $ | 15,403 | | | $ | 14,982 | | $ | 421
Less: Current liabilities | 9,035 | | | 7,948 | | | 1,087
Working capital (non-GAAP measure) | $ | 6,368 | | | $ | 7,034 | | (666) | 

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
Working capital decreased $0.7 billion compared with December 31, 2020. Balance changes in current assets increased working capital, driven by increases in inventory, partially offset by decreases in marketable securities-current. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowing and the current portion of long-term debt and accounts payable. 
Inventory increased from December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased underlying operating activity related to increased sales partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts, while marketable securities-current decreased from lower investments in commercial paper and U.S. treasury securities. Current portion of long-term debt increased based on underlying debt maturities while accounts payable also increased as a result of increased operating activity from that of late 2020 partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.
Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.
The increase in ROIC was driven by the increased operating income and the higher non-service pension and postretirement net benefit year-on-year.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.
In 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased compared to the same period last year, with this decrease primarily due to working capital changes. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable decreased operating cash flow by $507 million in 2021, compared to an operating cash flow improvement of $326 million in 2020. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2020, 3M reduced overall spending in light of uncertainty regarding COVID-19, but continued to invest in expanding the Company’s ability to increase production of respiratory products to meet worldwide demand. The Company expects increased capital spending in 2022 as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.
3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.
Refer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired,

in 2020 primarily relate to the payment made for contingent consideration in regards to the Acelity acquisition. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2020 primarily relate to the sales of the Company’s advanced ballistic-protection business and its drug delivery business.
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. In 2020 these included the maturity of the held-to-maturity debt security that was purchased to satisfy the redemption of the Third Lien Notes (which matured in May 2020). Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio.

2021 Debt Activity:
Decreases in debt were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption of $450 million in debt maturing in 2022 via make-whole call offers and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.
2020 Debt Activity:
Decreases in debt related to the repayment of debt primarily consisting of the aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in December 2020 via make-whole-call offers. Increases in debt were related to the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes. Outstanding commercial paper decreased $150 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Repurchases of Common Stock:
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2021, the Company purchased $2.2 billion of its own stock. 3M repurchased shares, after having suspended repurchases (with other repurchase activity limited to 3M's stock compensation plans) in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2022, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2022 dividend of $1.49 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.96 per share and marked the 64th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion vary across quarters throughout
the year. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion.
Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” and “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” sections for discussion of items that impacted the operating cash flow and purchases of PP&E components of the calculation of free cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Results of Operations” section for discussion of items that impacted the net income attributable to 3M component of the calculation of free cash flow conversion.
Free cash flow conversion decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 as net income attributable to 3M increased while free cash flow decreased.

Material Cash Requirement from Known Contractual and Other Obligations:
3M’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements:
•Tax obligations—Refer to Note 10.
•Debt—Refer to Note 12. Future cash payments for interest on long-term debt is approximately $6 billion. 
•Commitments and contingencies—Refer to Note 16. 
•Operating and finance leases—Refer to Note 17. 
3M purchases the majority of its materials and services as needed, with no unconditional commitments. In limited circumstances, in the normal course of business, 3M enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors that may take the form of, for example, take or pay contracts in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability to 3M of certain materials or services or to ensure ongoing efforts on capital projects. The Company expects to receive underlying materials or services for these purchase obligations. To the extent the limited amount of these purchase obligations fluctuates, it largely trends with normal-course changes in regular operating activities. Additionally, contractual capital commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
