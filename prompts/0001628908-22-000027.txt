Item 1. Business
Market Opportunity
We are a market leader in the new era of value-based care, in which leading health systems and physician organizations, which we refer to as providers, as well as health plans, which we refer to as payers, are moving their business models from traditional fee-for-service (“FFS”) reimbursement to an increasingly integrated clinical and financial responsibility for populations. We refer to our provider and payer customers as partners. We consider this integration of health care delivery and financial responsibility with the aim of lowering cost, enhancing quality, and improving satisfaction, to be the core of value-based care. We believe the pace of this integration is accelerating, driven by price pressure in traditional FFS health care, a market environment that is incentivizing value-based care models, growth in consumer-focused insurance programs, such as Medicare Advantage and innovation in data and technology.
The U.S. health care market was $4.1 trillion in spending during 2020, with approximately 20% of payments tied to performance or value-based care models. We believe the shift to value-based care is accelerating, driven by price pressure in traditional FFS health care, a policy and market environment that is incentivizing value-based care models and innovation in data and technology. We believe that the transition to value-based care is impacting the business models of both providers and payers in all segments of the market, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial lines of business.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve the cost and quality of care by realigning the business between payers and providers. Providers are well-positioned to lead this transition to value-based care because of their control over large portions of health care delivery costs, their primary position with consumers, and their strong local brands. Providers operating successfully in value-based arrangements can diversify their revenue streams, capture superior economics, and improve the quality of care they provide.
We also believe payers who successfully evolve their business model from that of FFS reimbursement towards value-based care can gain meaningful competitive advantages. Payers who successfully integrate care delivery and financing with providers stand to gain market advantage as medical expenses for their populations are lowered while quality of care is also improved. 
The transformation of provider and payer business models from FFS to value-based care requires infrastructure that performs two functions: (i) the ability to create clinical value, which is typically defined as lowering the cost of care while maintaining or improving quality, that is superior to FFS, and (ii) an administrative platform on which to operate the value-based business. In addition to this infrastructure, we believe that participants in value-based arrangements also need sustainable contractual mechanisms to enable each party to capture clinical value that is created and sufficient lives in value-based arrangements to provide a return on infrastructure investments. 
Our Business
Our History
Evolent was founded in 2011 by members of our management team, UPMC, an integrated delivery system in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and The Advisory Board Company, to enable providers to pursue a value-based business model and evolve their competitive position and market opportunity. Since that time, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions. On February 1, 2016, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with UHC. In October 2016, we acquired Valence Health. Valence Health, based in Chicago, Illinois, was founded in 1996 and provides TPA services, value-based administration, population health and advisory services with a particular focus on the Medicaid and pediatric markets. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Aldera, a key vendor and the primary software provider for the Valence Health TPA platform. In January 2018, we acquired a commercial health plan in New Mexico that focuses on small and large businesses, True Health. In October 2018, we acquired New Century Health, a national population health leader in managing specialty care for Medicare, commercial and Medicaid members under performance-based arrangements, focused primarily on oncology and cardiovascular care. In October 2021, we acquired Vital Decisions, a leading provider of technology-enabled advance care planning services.
On January 11, 2021, Evolent Health LLC, EH Holdings and True Health, each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “True Health SPA”) with Bright Health Management, Inc. (“Bright HealthCare”), pursuant to which EH Holdings agreed to sell all of its equity interests in True Health to Bright HealthCare. Closing of the transactions contemplated by the True Health SPA occurred on March 31, 2021 (the “True Health Closing”) and the Company has had no continuing involvement with True Health subsequent to the closing except a pre-existing services agreement for claims processing and other health plan administrative functions.
As of the first quarter of 2021, the Company determined that True Health met the discontinued operations criteria and as such, True Health assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020, and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are not included in continuing operations in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company made organizational changes, including re-evaluating its reportable segments, as a result of the entry into the agreement to sell True Health on January 11, 2021. Effective during the first quarter of 2021, the Company manages its operations and allocates resources across two reportable segments as follows:
•Evolent Health Services, which houses our administrative simplification solution and certain supporting population health infrastructure; and
•Clinical Solutions, which includes our specialty care management and physician-oriented total cost of care solutions, along with the New Century Health, Vital Decisions and Evolent Care Partners brands. 
Evolent Health Services Overview
Our Evolent Health Services segment includes our integrated value based care platform designed to help our customers manage and administer patient health in a more cost-effective manner. Upon the acquisitions in 2016 of Valence Health and Aldera, we have invested to upgrade the platform and integrate it with Identifi® and our clinical solutions to create an integrated value-based care platform.
Our comprehensive health plan administration services help regional and national payers and providers assemble the infrastructure required to operate, manage and capitalize on a variety of financial and administrative management services, such as health plan services, risk management, analytics and reporting and leadership and management. The economic model of this solution is primarily fee-based with defined service-level agreements around key operating metrics. The services provided by Evolent Health Services include:
•Health plan services: Health plan services is a comprehensive suite of services including third-party administration, enrollment and billing support, medical and utilization management, third-party payment and program integrity support and provider network contracting services. Other health plan related services include sales and marketing, product development, actuarial, and regulatory and compliance.
•Pharmacy benefit management: Our team of professionals support the prescription drug component of providers’ plan offerings and bring national buying power and dedicated resources that are tightly integrated with the care delivery model. Differentiated from what we consider to be traditional PBMs, our solution is integrated into patient care and engages population health levers including generic utilization, provider management, and utilization management to reduce pharmacy costs.
•Risk management: Our risk management services provide the capabilities needed to successfully manage risk for payers, including analysis, data and operational integration with payer processes, and ongoing performance management.
•Analytics and reporting: Our analytics and reporting services provide the ongoing and ad hoc analytic teams and reports required to measure, inform and improve performance, including population health analytics, market analytics, network evaluation, staffing models, physician effectiveness, clinical delivery optimization and patient engagement.
•Leadership and management: Our local and national talent assist our partners in effectively managing the performance of their value-based operations.
Identifi® is our proprietary technology system that aggregates and analyzes data, manages care workflows and engages patients. Identifi® links our processes with those of our partners and other third parties to create a connected clinical delivery ecosystem, stratify patient populations, standardize clinical work flows and enable high-quality, cost-effective care. The configurable nature and broad capabilities of Identifi® help enhance the benefits our partners receive from our services and increase the effectiveness of our partners’ existing technology architecture. Highlights of the capabilities of Identifi® include the following:
•Data and integration services: Data from disparate sources, such as EMRs, and lab and pharmacy data, is collected, assembled, integrated and maintained to provide health care professionals with a holistic view of the patient.
•Clinical and business content: Clinical and business content is applied to the integrated data to create actionable information to optimize clinical and financial performance.
•EMR integration: Data and clinical insights from Identifi® are fed back into partner EMRs to improve both provider and patient satisfaction, create workflow efficiencies, promote clinical documentation and coding and provide clinical support at the point-of-care.
•Applications: A suite of cloud-based applications manages the clinical, financial and operational aspects of the value-based model. Our applications scale with the clinical, financial and administrative needs of our provider 
partners. As additional capabilities are required by our partners, they are often deployed as applications through Identifi®.
Clinical Solutions
Our Clinical Solutions segment has two primary solutions: (i) specialty care management services, and (ii) total cost of care management. From time to time, we package our solutions under various go-to-market brand names to create product differentiation. Our partners may engage us to provide one type of solution, or multiple types of solutions, depending on specific needs.
Core elements of our total cost of care management services include: (i) population health performance, which supports the delivery of patient-centric cost effective care and (ii) delivery network alignment, comprising the development of high performance delivery networks. Our total cost of care solution focuses on primary care providers, who serve as the primary point of contact for populations accessing medical care.
Our specialty care management services support a broad range of specialty care delivery stakeholders during their transition from fee-for-service to value-based care, independent of their stage of maturation and specific market dynamics. We focus on the oncology and cardiology markets with the objective of helping providers and payers deliver higher quality, more affordable care and we provide comprehensive quality management for oncology and cardiology patients from diagnosis through advance care planning services.
Specialty Care Management Services Solution
The foundation for our specialty care management services solution was derived through our acquisition in 2018 of New Century Health, a national population health leader in managing specialty care for Medicare, commercial and Medicaid members under performance-based and technology and services arrangements. Since then, we have continued to invest in the solution to broaden, deepen, and scale its capabilities. We have invested in internal capabilities as well as the acquisition of assets that expand our ability to provide more value for our clients and align with the evolution of our strategic approach to Clinical Solutions. For example, on October 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Vital Decisions, a leading provider of technology-enabled advance care planning services. The addition of Vital Decisions' specialized patient engagement services is intended to help enhance our solutions impact within our specialty care management services solution by improving patient care quality and by adding capabilities in patient engagement, telehealth and end-of-life management. 
Since its founding in 2002, New Century Health has focused on the oncology and cardiology markets, which are the two largest specialties in Medicare Advantage by total expenditures. Using clinical data analytics, predictive modeling and decision support tools, New Century Health has developed proprietary clinical pathways in these markets. Managed through its proprietary specialty care management platform, New Century Health combines high performance networks of specialists and enhanced clinical pathways to deliver higher quality and more affordable care, which we consider to be hallmarks of value-based care, to patients, providers and payers. Historically, New Century Health focused on the Medicare market and offered performance-based contracts, as well as technology and services arrangements, primarily to payers in the Medicare HMO segment of the overall Medicare market. More recently, New Century Health has entered into performance-based contracts with Medicaid health plans. 
New Century Health provides a differentiated approach designed to meet market challenges based on (i) networks of high-performance providers, (ii) design of evidence-based clinical pathways and (iii) leveraging our proprietary specialty care management technology.
(i)High performance provider networks
We develop high-performance provider networks with tools, capabilities and incentives to align and support physicians. We develop and manage comprehensive specialty networks, provide physician engagement and support and identify provider financial incentive alignment. Key features include:
•Direct contracts with specialists facilitate ease of care.
•Comprehensive specialty networks include multiple downstream subspecialists.
•Incentivizes financial payment for quality and cost efficient utilization.
•Minimizes “buy and bill” incentives through shared savings methodologies.
•Dedicated provider operations provide staff to support practices.
•Clinical response team provides clinical education on-site to practice staff.
•Dedicated central call center facilitates referrals and helps to resolve claims issues.
•Provides established system of ongoing provider education and training.
•Increases the frequency of utilization and value of advance care planning.
(ii)Design evidence-based clinical pathways
We design high-quality evidence-based clinical pathways to drive provider behavior towards improved quality of care at a lower cost. The transparent pathway development process for our specialty population health focal areas, oncology and cardiology, is designed to achieve the following objectives:
•Reduce unnecessary clinical variation.
•Support physician clinical decision making of evidence-based therapies.
•Increase patient engagement.
•Facilitate total cost-of-care management.
Our clinical pathways are based on national guidelines with independent scientific advisory boards, in-house clinical expertise with original publications and presentations at national congress. We employ a collaborative review process that is not based on denials, which includes customized clinical review based on tier 1-5 drugs and proactive monitoring response to therapy. We employ quality metrics and clinical benchmarking to continually improve our pathways. We incentivize financial payment for quality by minimizing “buy and bill” incentives and through a shared savings methodology.
(iii)Leverage proprietary specialty care management technology
We leverage a custom specialty care management workflow platform, CareProTM, to provide clinical decision support and manage providers to high-quality care, while aiming to achieve significant cost savings. Our technology consists of a clinical decision support portal that provides oversight of individual treatment plans for pathway adherence. Our platform integrates clinical analytics and protocols, pharmacy management, physician engagement, network management and claims payment to drive improved outcomes for partners. Key attributes include:
•Decision support portal delivers specialty specific clinical experience based on assigned roles (e.g., cardiologist vs. oncologist).
•Custom-built rules engine allows flexibility for multiple specialties and automated decisions based on clinical relevance, considering, for example, rigor levels based on specified payers and providers.
•Workflow capability facilitates a seamless collaboration within and across organizations, connecting payers and clearing houses for systematic data exchange.
•Nurse triage system leverages proprietary technology infrastructure.
•Overall flexibility enables a new business launch of existing specialty within 60 days.
Total Cost of Care Management Solution
Our total cost of care management solution was developed based on the intellectual property contributions of UPMC at our founding. Since then, we have continued to invest in the solution to broaden, deepen and scale its capabilities.
Our total cost of care management solution enables providers to manage populations they may be accountable for under value-based contracts with payers or ACO contracts with CMS. This solution seeks to reduce the total cost of care for a given population by identifying and managing high-cost patients with targeted interventions managed and coordinated through primary care physicians. The economic model of our total cost of care management solution is primarily performance-based, which we believe enhances our ability to influence provider behavior by aligning our incentives with our partners. We use, and may continue to use, different go-to-market brand names for various solution packages, depending on the markets we seek to address. These go-to-market brand names include: (i) Value Based Services, wherein we support primarily health systems in their value-based operations, and (ii) Evolent Care Partners, wherein we offer physicians the opportunity to join Evolent’s proprietary payer contracting vehicles, scaled risk pools, and operating model. 
We refer to the offerings within this solution as value-based care services. Core elements of our value-based care services include: (i) population health performance, which supports the delivery of patient-centric cost effective care and (ii) delivery network alignment, comprising the development of high performance delivery networks. We integrate change management processes and ongoing physician-led transformation into all value-based services to build engagement, integration and alignment within our partners to successfully deliver value-based care and sustain performance. We have standardized the processes described below and are able to leverage our expertise across our partner base. Through the technological and clinical integration we achieve, our solutions are delivered as engrained components of our partners’ core operations rather than as add-on solutions.
(i)Population Health Performance
Population Health Performance is an integrated suite of technology-enabled solutions that supports the delivery of quality care in an environment where a provider’s need to manage health has significantly expanded. These solutions include:
•Clinical programs: Care processes and ongoing clinical innovation that enables providers to target the right intervention at the right time for a given patient.
•Specialized care team: Multi-disciplinary team that is deployed telephonically from a centralized location or throughout a local market to operate clinical programs, engage patients and support physicians.
•Patient engagement: Integrated technologies and processes that enable outreach to engage patients in their own care process.
•Quality and risk coding: Engagement of physicians to identify opportunities to close gaps in care and improve clinical documentation efforts.
(ii)Delivery Network Alignment
We help our partners build the capabilities that are required to develop and maintain a coordinated and financially-aligned provider network that can deliver high-quality care necessary for value-based contracts. These capabilities include:
•High-performance network: Supporting the capabilities needed to build, maintain and optimize provider- and clinically-integrated networks.
•Value compensation models: Developing and supporting physician incentive payment programs that are linked to quality outcomes, payer shared savings arrangements and health plan performance.
•Integrated specialty partnerships: Supporting the technology-enabled strategies, analytics and staff needed to optimize network referral patterns.
Sources of Revenue
The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring multi-year contracts, which we refer to as platform and operations. Platform and operations services accounted for 98.8%, 98.7% and 97.8% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe the recurring, multi-year nature of our platform and operations contracts enables us to have strong visibility into future revenue. The amount of revenue in a given platform and operations contract is typically driven by: (i) the number of members that Evolent is contracted to manage, (ii) the population types being served (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Commercial), and (iii) the depth and breadth of the services and technology applications that our partners utilize from us. In situations involving clinical solutions, we typically elect to: (iv) participate alongside or co-own risk-sharing arrangements with our partners whereby we share in a portion of the upside and downside clinical performance, or by owning a portion of the underwriting results through capitation. We believe performance-based contracts align our partners’ incentives with our own and enables us to capture greater value from our contracts. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on these aligned operating partnerships. We believe the current value-based care arrangements of our payer and provider partners represent a relatively small portion of their overall total opportunity.
Our business model benefits from scale, as we leverage our purpose-built technology-enabled solutions and centralized resources in conjunction with the growth of our partners’ membership base. While our absolute investment in our centralized resources and technologies may increase over time, we expect it will decrease as a percentage of revenue as we are able to scale this investment across a broader group of partners. We expect to grow with current partners as they increase membership in their existing operations, through expanding the number of services we provide to our existing partners, by adding new partners and by capturing value through risk-sharing arrangements.
The other portion of our revenue, which we call transformation, is typically composed of implementation services associated with our recurring revenue relationships. Due to the nature of recurring multi-year contracts, as we have added additional partners, transformation revenue has decreased to approximately 1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Significant Activities
On August 2, 2021, Evolent Health LLC and EV Thunder Merger Sub, LLC, each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the Company to acquire Vital Decisions. On October 1, 2021, we consummated the acquisition of Vital Decisions for $46.5 million in cash and the issuance of 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock. Vital Decisions reports into Evolent’s specialty care management offering, New Century Health, and is consolidated into the Company’s Clinical Solutions segment. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the transformations occurring in health care payment and delivery described above. We believe this environment that rewards the better use of information to drive patient outcomes aligns with our business model, recent investments and other competitive strengths.
Early Innovator
We believe we are an innovator in the delivery of comprehensive value-based care solutions. We were founded in 2011, ahead of the implementation of the ACA and before the rapid expansion of programs, such as Medicare ACOs or Medicare Bundled Payment Initiatives. Since our inception, we have invested a significant amount in expanding our offerings.
Differentiated Offering in High Cost Oncology and Cardiology Markets
Cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for approximately 15% of total U.S. health expenditures in 2016 to 2017. One of the major cost drivers is spending on oncology drugs which rose 60% from $45 billion in 2016 to $72 billion in 2020. We offer a comprehensive performance based solution that we believe delivers meaningful savings to customers relative to historical spend while at the same time improving the quality of care. Our specialty care management solution covered approximately 18.4 million lives in Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial markets through our Performance suite and New Century Health Technology and Services suite as of December 31, 2021 and we believe our solution is one of the most comprehensive in the market today.
Comprehensive End-to-End Solutions
We provide end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled solutions for our partners to succeed in value-based payment models. We believe that offering comprehensive and integrated solutions which bring together clinical and administrative management allows payers and providers to accelerate their path to adoption of value-based care.
Depth of Market Experience
With experience across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial markets, our depth and variety of expertise allows us to serve a variety of customer types in the broad health care marketplace including health systems, providers, physicians, health plans, ACOs, delegated arrangements and other payers.
Proprietary Technology
Our integrated proprietary technology, Identifi®, allows us to deliver a connected delivery ecosystem, implement replicable clinical processes, scale our value-based services and capitalize on multiple types of value-based payment relationships.
We leverage a custom specialty care management workflow platform, CareProTM, to provide clinical decision support and manage providers to high-quality care, while aiming to achieve significant cost savings. Our technology consists of a clinical decision support portal that provides oversight of individual treatment plans for pathway adherence. Our platform integrates clinical analytics and protocols, pharmacy management, physician engagement, network management and claims payment to drive improved outcomes for partners.
We believe we are creating scaled benefits for our partners in areas such as data analytics, administrative services and care management. We expect Identifi® and CareProTM to enable us to deliver increasing levels of efficiency to our partners.
Provider-Heritage Brand Identity
We believe our provider-heritage brand identity and origins differentiate us from our competitors in the value-based care services area. We believe our solutions resonate with potential partners seeking proven solutions that work with providers in a manner that attempts to minimize friction and foster a care team approach. Our analytical and clinical solutions are rooted in UPMC’s experience in growing a provider-led, integrated delivery network over the 15-years prior to the founding of Evolent Health, Inc., and growing to become one of the largest provider-owned health plans in the country. Our unique position allows for the sharing of data across multiple payers and care delivery integration regardless of payer, which we believe is not possible with traditional, payer-siloed solutions.
Partnership-Driven Business Model
Our business model is predicated on strategic partnerships with leading providers and payers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the provider care delivery and payment work-flow, contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit. In certain cases, we also agree to participate alongside our partners in risk-sharing or other support arrangements to increase our alignment of interests via performance-based relationships.
Proven Leadership Team
We have made a significant investment in building an industry-leading management team. Our senior leadership team has extensive experience in the health care industry and a track record of delivering measurable clinical, financial and operational improvement for health care providers and payers. Our Chief Executive Officer, Seth Blackley, had served as our President since August 2011. Prior to co-founding the company, Mr. Blackley was the Executive Director of Corporate Development and Strategic Planning at The Advisory Board from June 2007 to August 2011.
Growth Opportunities
Multiple Avenues for Growth with Our Existing, Embedded Partner Base
We have established a multi-year partnership model with multiple drivers of embedded growth through the following avenues:
•growth in lives in existing covered populations;
•partners expanding into new lines of value-based care to capture growth in new profit pools; 
•cross-selling additional solutions to existing partners; and
•capturing value created through a variety of value-based arrangements by participating alongside our partners in upside risk sharing arrangements. 
Early Stages of a Rapidly Growing Transformational Addressable Market
We believe that our existing partners represent a small fraction of providers and payers that could benefit from our solutions. The transformation of the care delivery and payment model in the United States has been rapid, but it is still in the early stages. Approximately 20% of health care payments were paid through performance or value-based care programs in 2020 and it is estimated that this number will continue to grow.
We believe there is significant market opportunity in our total cost of care solution. As of December 31, 2021, our solution served less than 1% of the Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO-assignable population. Furthermore, we believe that populations covered by CMS ACOs will continue to grow, and also that the solution will be relevant to private payer value-based arrangements. 
We believe there is a significant market opportunity in our specialty care management services solution. As of December 31, 2021, New Century Health served approximately 1.4 million Medicaid Managed Care and Medicare HMO patients out of total population of approximately 70 million. This represents a market share of roughly 2% of this total population. We believe that the adoption of this solution in oncology and cardiology by payers serving the Medicare HMO market is very low but is likely to increase as the growth in spending in these specialties is higher than the growth in overall health care spending. Furthermore, we believe that our specialty care management solution is scalable to Medicaid and other lines of business.
Capitalize on Growth in Select Government-Driven Programs
The number of people managed by government-driven programs in the United States has seen significant growth since 2016. Specifically, the number of Medicare beneficiaries reached 62 million in 2021, an 11% increase from 2016. The nature of our variable fee economic model enables us to benefit from this growth in government-managed lives. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to government-driven programs, primarily comprised of Medicaid and, to a less significant extent, Medicare.
Ability to Capture Additional Value through Delivering Clinical Results
We are capturing only a portion of the addressable clinical and administrative dollars in the market through our current solutions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to capture an increasing portion of the medical dollar over time, namely the remainder of the premium dollar which goes to medical expenses, and we have begun to do so in certain performance-based relationships. We believe business models that allow us to participate in the medical savings through a variety of risk-sharing arrangements that align incentives to reduce costs and improve quality outcomes will enable us to grow and differentiate ourselves from other vendors. We anticipate the manner with which we partner and share in risk with health care providers will likely continue to evolve over time given the still nascent and fragmented nature of value-based care.
Expand Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
There are multiple business offerings that our partners may require to operate in a value-based care environment that we do not currently provide, including but not limited to:
•physician employment;
•PBM expansion to include additional specialty pharmacy management capabilities;
•additional specialty lines of business beyond oncology and cardiology, including kidney, musculoskeletal and fetal-maternal medicine care;
•on-site or specialty clinic services; and
•consumer engagement and digital outreach.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Investments
We believe that the nature of our competitive landscape provides meaningful acquisition and investment opportunities. Our industry is in the early stages of its life cycle and there are multiple firms attempting to capitalize on the transformation of the care delivery model and the various forms of new profit pools. We believe that our partners will require an end-to-end solution and we believe we are well positioned to meet this demand by expanding the breadth of our offerings through not only organic growth, but also the acquisition of niche vendors and non-core portions of larger enterprises. From time to time, we may also pursue acquisition and investment opportunities of businesses related to services we currently provide or that are complementary to our technical capabilities. As an example of executing on our strategy, on October 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Vital Decisions, a leading provider of technology-enabled advance care planning services. The acquisition of Vital Decisions is expected to deepen capabilities of both organizations, allowing cross-sell, an enhanced value proposition to partners and an opportunity to increase the margin profile of the combined organization.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services to payers and providers throughout the United States. Our sales team works closely with our leadership team and subject matter experts to foster long-term relationships with our partners’ leadership and board of directors given the nature of our partnerships. Our dedicated business development team works closely with our partners to identify additional service opportunities on a continuous basis.
Partner Relationships
Our business is predicated on strategic partnerships with leading payers and providers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the care delivery and payment work flow, contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit.
We have sought to partner with leading payers and providers in sizable markets, which we believe creates a growth cycle that benefits from the secular transition to value-based care.
As of December 31, 2021, we had contractual relationships with 44 operating partners. We define an operating partner as an individual health plan or provider entity under contract with the Company based on a specific state-level geography and whether a relationship is based on fees for covered lives or capitation per life under management. Certain of our partners operate in a local and highly decentralized manner, requiring negotiation and contracting at a local level to expand into new arrangements and thus may be considered multiple entities under this definition, depending on partner business requirements.
The following table summarizes those partners who represented at least 10.0% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019:

 | For the Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 (1) | | 2020 (1) | | 2019 (1)
Cook County Health and Hospitals Systems (2) | 28.0 | % | | 22.3 | % | | 11.6 | %
Florida Blue Medicare, Inc. (3) | 14.1 | % | | N/A | | N/A 
Passport (4) | * | | 19.0 | % | | 23.0 | % 
New Mexico Health Connections | * | | * | | 13.4 | % 

————————
(1)The denominator excludes $44.8 million, $117.4 million and $171.7 million of True Health premium revenue reclassified to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)Cook County Health and Hospital Systems utilizes both our administrative simplification solutions provided by Evolent Health Services, which accounted for 9.0% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our specialty care management solutions provided by New Century Health which accounted for 19.0% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
(3)Customer added during the year ended December 31, 2021. Florida Blue Medicare, Inc. utilizes our specialty care management solutions provided by New Century Health.
(4)Represents revenues from EVH Passport/UHC through the Molina Closing. Subsequent to the Molina Closing on September 1, 2020, the Company has not received any material revenue from EVH Passport. However, as part of the Molina Closing, we entered into a new contract with Molina on similar terms to our prior services contract with EVH Passport through December 31, 2020 which accounted for approximately 9.7% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
* Represents less than 10.0% of the respective balance
As of December 31, 2021, our average contractual relationship with our operating partners was approximately 5.2 years, with an average of 0.8 years of performance remaining per contract. 
Our contracts governing the relationships with our operating partners include key terms which may include the period of performance, revenue rates, advanced billing terms, service level agreements, termination clauses, exclusivity clauses and right of first refusal clauses. Typically, these contracts provide for a monthly payment calculated based on a specified rate multiplied by the number of members that our partners are managing. The specified rate varies depending on which market-facing solutions the partner has adopted and the number of services and technology applications they are utilizing. In some cases, we are responsible for paying for all, or substantially all, of the cost of care for a defined scope of health care services out of the revenue we receive. Some of our contracts allow for advance billing of our partners. In some of our contracts, a defined portion of the revenue is at risk and can be refunded to the partner if certain service levels are not attained. We monitor our compliance with the service levels to determine whether a refund will be provided and record an estimate of these refunds. In addition, certain of our contracts provide that if we fail to meet specified implementation targets, the contracts will terminate and we will be subject to financial penalties. Separately, the contracts of New Century Health typically run for one-year terms. While they typically contain year-to-year renewal provisions, we cannot assure you any or all of these contracts will be renewed in any particular year.
Although the revenue from our contracts is not guaranteed because certain of our contracts are terminable for convenience by our partners after a notice period has passed, certain partners would be required to pay us a termination fee in certain circumstances. Termination fees and the related notice period in certain of our contracts are determined based on the scope of the market-facing solutions that the partner has adopted and the duration of the contract. Most of our contracts include cure periods for certain breaches, during which time we may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a partner’s ability to terminate the contract. However, certain of our contracts are also terminable immediately on the occurrence of certain events. For example, some of our contracts may be terminated by the partner if we fail to achieve target performance metrics over a specified period. Certain of our contracts may be terminated by the partner immediately following repeated failures by us to provide specified levels of service over periods ranging from six months to more than a year. Certain of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the partner if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. Additionally, if a partner were to lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities, our contract with such partner could in effect be terminated. The loss, termination or renegotiation of any contract could negatively impact our results. In addition, as our partners’ businesses respond to market dynamics and financial pressures, and as our partners make strategic business decisions in respect of the lines of business they pursue and programs in which they participate, we expect that certain of our partners will, from time to time, seek to restructure their agreements with us.
The contracts often contain exclusivity or other restrictive provisions, which may limit our ability to partner with or provide services to other providers or purchase services from other vendors within certain time periods and in certain geographic areas. The exclusivity and other restrictive provisions are negotiated on an individual basis and vary depending on many factors, including the term and scope of the contract. The time limit on these exclusivity and other restrictive provisions typically corresponds to the term of the 
contract. These exclusivity or other restrictive provisions often apply to specific competitors of our health system partners or specific geographic areas within a particular state or an entire state, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, exceptions for employer plan entities that have operations in the restricted geographic areas but that are headquartered elsewhere. Accordingly, these exclusivity clauses may prevent us from entering into relationships with certain potential partners.
The contracts with our partners impose other obligations on us. For example, we typically agree that all services provided under the partner contract and all employees providing such services will comply with our partner’s policies and procedures. In addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our partners against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties.
Competition
The market for our solutions is fragmented, competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities. Our partners may also choose to insource solution functions from us in part or in whole. Our services solutions compete based on several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement using products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. We also compete based on price and aligned performance relationships.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce health care laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable health care and insurance laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and state laws and regulations that impact our operations:
Health Care Reform
In March 2010, the ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to, collectively, as health care reform, was signed into law. Health care reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. For example, health care reform includes a mandate that employers with over 50 employees offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer individual major medical plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality; establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels.
Health care reform amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Services Act. Health care reform is being implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. Most of the ACA regulations became effective on January 1, 2014. Since its enactment, the ACA has faced multiple congressional repeal and replace efforts, multiple challenges before the Supreme Court, and dozens of amendments including repeal of the tax penalty associated with the individual mandate to purchase coverage, plus three other taxes originally imposed by the ACA (on certain on employer-sponsored coverage, health insurers, and medical device companies). Separately, in December 2020 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional but did not invalidate the rest of the law; while in June 2021 the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs (two individuals and several states) lacked standing challenge the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate, leaving the merit questions of the case unresolved.
In his first year of office, the Biden Administration overturned several Trump Administration Executive Orders related to the ACA – for example, one directing federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented and two that previously cut funding for ACA marketplace outreach and enrollment. It is not known what other changes the new administration will implement through regulations or future executive orders, and how those may impact our partners and our business. It is also not known what legislation will advance in Congress – for example in the current Congress, we have seen proposals ranging from modest expansions of Medicare benefits (hearing, dental, vision) and drug pricing reforms to broad-scale reforms such as “Medicare for All” and others in between. Because of the continued uncertainty about the ACA and health care law more broadly, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty their likely impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
In addition, Congress, state legislatures and third-party payers may continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the health care delivery system, including with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation or changes. Health care reform has resulted in profound changes to the individual health insurance market and our business, and we expect these changes to continue.
Stark Law
We are subject to federal and state “self-referral” laws. The Stark Law is a federal statute that prohibits physicians from referring patients for items covered by Medicare or Medicaid to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship, unless that relationship falls within a specified exception. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute and is violated even if the parties did not have an improper intent to induce physician referrals. The Stark Law is relevant to our business because we frequently organize arrangements of various kinds under which (a) physicians and hospitals jointly invest in and own ACOs, clinically integrated networks and other entities that engage in value-based contracting with third-party payers or (b) physicians are paid by hospitals or hospital affiliates for care management, medical or other services related to value-based contracts. We evaluate when these investment and compensation arrangements create financial relationships under the Stark Law and design structures that are intended to satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver.
Anti-kickback Laws
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. The United States federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities knowingly and willfully to solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute raises similar compliance issues as the Stark Law. While there are safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, they differ from the Stark Law exceptions in that compliance with a safe harbor is not mandatory. If an arrangement falls outside the safe harbors, it must be evaluated on its specific facts to assess whether regulatory authorities might take the position that one purpose of the arrangement is to induce referrals of federal health care program business. Our business arrangements implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute for the same reasons they raise Stark Law issues. We evaluate whether investment and compensation arrangements being developed by us on behalf of hospital partners fall within one of the safe harbors or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver. If not, we consider the factors that regulatory authorities are likely to consider in attempting to identify the intent behind such arrangements. We also design business models that reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger Anti-Kickback Statute claims.
Antitrust Laws
The antitrust laws are designed to prevent competitors from jointly fixing prices. However, competitors often work collaboratively to reduce the cost of health care and improve quality. To balance these competing goals, antitrust enforcement agencies have established a regulatory framework under which claims of per se price fixing can be avoided if a network of competitors (such as an ACO or clinically integrated network) is financially or clinically integrated. In this context, we evaluate the tests for financial and clinical integration that would be applied to the provider networks that we are helping to create and support, including the nature and extent of any financial risk that must be assumed to be deemed financially integrated and the types of programs that must be implemented to achieve clinical integration. However, even if a network is integrated, it is still subject to a “rule of reason” test to determine whether its activities are, on balance, pro-competitive. The key factors in the rule of reason analysis are market share and exclusivity. We focus on network size, composition and contracting policies to strengthen our partners’ position that their networks meet the rule of reason test.
Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws
The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our activities relating to the way we sell and market our services, including our provider-led risk adjustment solution, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
HIPAA, Privacy and Data Security Regulations
By processing data on behalf of our partners, we are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act and related state laws. We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws, as well as state laws regulating the processing of protected personal information, including laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of social security numbers and related identifiers.
The regulations that implement HIPAA and the HITECH Act establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities,” and their “business associates” (which includes anyone who performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce). Our partners’ health plans generally will be covered entities, and, as their business associate, they may ask us to contractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements.
HIPAA Health Care Fraud Standards
The HIPAA health care fraud statute created a class of federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters, known as the “federal health care offenses.” The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, while the HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the payment for health care benefits, items or services. Entities that are found to have aided or abetted in a violation of the HIPAA federal health care offenses are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal.
Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, as well as certain other individuals. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by federal and state governments and are administered by states under an approved plan that provides hospital and other health care benefits to qualifying individuals. As we increase our exposure to Medicare and Medicaid businesses through new and existing partners, we increase our exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and regulation of the Medicaid and Medicare programs in which we and our partners participate. We are subject to regulation by both CMS and state agencies in respect of certain services we provide relating to Medicaid and Medicare programs.
Because some of our partners are participants in governmental programs, our services have in the past and may again in the future be subject to periodic surveys and audits by governmental entities or contractors for compliance with Medicare and other standards and requirements. As a result of surveys or audits, CMS may seek premium and other refunds, prohibit us from continuing to market or enroll members in plans, exclude us from participating in one or more programs or institute other sanctions against us if we fail to comply with CMS regulations or Medicare contractual requirements.
The regulations and requirements applicable to us and other participants in Medicaid and Medicare programs are complex and subject to change. In October 2021, the CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) published a white paper outlining its new strategic direction. Key themes include an increased focus on health equity, on streamlining the CMMI model portfolio, and on advancing new goals to get “all Medicare beneficiaries” and “the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries” into care relationships with accountability for quality and total cost of care by 2030. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of this new strategic direction on availability or functioning of CMMI models, participation in CMS programs or modification to their rules and regulations,  changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Following recent elections, Congress and state and local legislatures may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such changes in the law, or new interpretations of existing laws, may have a significant impact on our methods and costs of doing business. Additionally, expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Going forward, we expect CMS and Congress to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the Medicare program as well as modify the terms and requirements of the program. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity, either of which could adversely affect us. Similarly, we cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid and Medicare programs, nor can we predict the impact those changes will have on our business operations or financial results, but the effects could be materially adverse.
Consumer Protection Laws
Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC, Federal Communications Commission and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access.
State Privacy Laws
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, which we refer to as state privacy laws, that govern the use and disclosure of a person’s medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These state privacy laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions, such as UR, or TPA, issuance of notices of privacy practices and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state privacy laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state privacy laws, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
Other State Laws
State insurance laws require licenses for certain health plan administrative activities, including TPA licenses for the processing, handling and adjudication of health insurance claims and UR agent licenses for providing medical management services. Given the nature and scope of services that we provide to certain partners, we are required to maintain TPA and UR agent licenses and ensure that such licenses are in good standing on an annual basis. In addition, laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services. These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps. Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection, delay of claims and possible interest and regulatory penalties. The Company has also established a captive insurance company under the laws of the State of Vermont and is subject to the captive insurance laws of that state.
Insurance subsidiaries and investees must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, EVH Passport is regulated under specific Kentucky laws and regulations and indirectly affected by other health care-related laws and regulations. State regulations mandate minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements.
Intellectual Property
Our continued growth and success depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including our Identifi® software and CareProTM platform. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business).
However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive online presence or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our intellectual property position see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks relating to our business and industry.”
Research and Development
Our research and development expenditures primarily consist of our strategic investment in enhancing the functionality and usability of our software, Identifi® and developing programs and processes to maximize care delivery efficiency and effectiveness. We also capitalize software development costs related to Identifi® and CarePro TM. Our research and development expenditures and capitalized software development costs also include the suite of products developed by New Century Health, Accordion, Valence Health and Aldera.
Environmental Focus
We believe we have an important role to pay in society as an industry leader and partner. Though our environmental footprint is modest, environmental sustainability and responsible resource use are important for the Company now and in the future. We continue 
to assess our physical office footprint and prioritize energy efficiency and environmental design in the buildings we occupy. As of December 31, 2021, our offices in Arlington, VA and Chicago are LEED Gold Certified and our regional office in Pune, India has achieved the rating of iNFHRA Excellence in Sustainability.
Human Capital Management
We believe our commitment to and investment in human capital enables our continued efforts to dramatically reduce the total cost of care, improve clinical quality and simplify administration. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,500 global employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We focus on the following key measures and objectives in managing our business in order to deploy and develop our human capital strategy:
•Employee Compensation and Incentives
•Employee Training and Career Development
•Employee Well Being 
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Employee Compensation and Incentives
We aim to attract and retain the highest caliber of health care talent. We believe in pay for performance and structure our compensation to annually incent & reward exceptional performance at all levels in the organization. Ensuring that our employees are compensated fairly and have the appropriate incentives in place to meet and exceed their potential is an integral part of our human capital management. We annually conduct market pay equity assessments and compensation reviews, and we continue to actively work to reduce unconscious bias in our sourcing, hiring practices, performance reviews and promotion opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities.
Employee Training and Career Development
We believe that the continued edification and development of our talent is important in continuing to maintain growth as a company as well as the growth of our individual talent. Training programs are available to all employees through our company portal that is managed by our learning and development team. Our learning and development portal enables employees to find on-demand content, view and attend live learning sessions. Additionally, during 2020 we launched our internal mobility initiative. The initiative gives employees the visibility and opportunity to apply for positions within their current teams as well as company-wide. In 2021, we offered Talent profiles within our human capital management system to continue to support this initiative. We believe this initiative will continue to help with transparency of opportunities and talent across the organization, enables employees to develop in areas that align to their career goals as well as focus on increasing the diversity of our senior levels within the company over time. 
Employee Well-Being
We believe that we have a responsibility to help maintain the health and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees with comprehensive benefits including: medical insurance, dental, vision, PTO and 401k plan. In addition, we offer 100% paid maternity leave, parental leave, fertility support, diabetes and hypertension program offerings. With the on-going COVID-19 pandemic impacting our employees, we have continued to support work from home across our employee population. We continue to offer additional mental health offerings through our insurance provider and TalkSpace, work from home office set-up support, regular employee feedback surveys, personal impact days to promote social improvement engagement, an employee crisis fund, holistic wellness initiatives during the year that include yoga, cooking sessions, meditation and wellness challenges.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that Evolent is a stronger company with diverse employees and encourage hiring and retention practices that focus on top performing talent regardless of gender, national origin, ethnicity or other protected class. In 2021, we continue to build on established diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives to continue to create a more equitable workspace. This initiative included additional training for leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the organization and the hiring of a Head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to focus on diversity as well as an internal organization review that focused around pay, job descriptions, recruiting, career pathing and development. In 2021, we introduced a new development program focused on top diverse employees across the business. We believe our continued commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion enables us to attract, develop and retain the highest caliber talent in health care. The table below demonstrates our progress on numerous diversity, equity and inclusion objectives based on our latest engagement surveys for each of the respective years below (results are based on self-identification):

In addition, our supplier diversity mission is to proactively identify, build relationships with, and purchase goods and services from certified small businesses as well as enterprises owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGTBQ+, and disabled persons that can help the Company achieve its corporate objectives.
Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal programs and initiatives, allow us to effectively execute our human capital strategy.
