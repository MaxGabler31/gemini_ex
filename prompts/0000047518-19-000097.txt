We are a global medical technology leader whose approximately 10,000 employees have a single purpose: enhancing outcomes for patients and their caregivers by Advancing Connected Care™. Around the world, our innovations touch over 7 million patients each day. Our products and services help enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, optimize surgical efficiency and accelerate patient recovery while simplifying clinical communication and shifting care closer to home. We make these outcomes possible through connected smart beds, patient lifts, patient assessment and monitoring technologies, caregiver collaboration tools, respiratory health devices, advanced equipment for the surgical space and more, delivering actionable, real-time insights at the point of care.

Products and Services
Patient Support Systems. Our innovative patient support systems include a variety of specialty frames and surfaces (such as medical surgical (“med-surg”) beds, intensive care unit beds, and bariatric patient beds), patient mobility solutions (such as lifts and other devices used to safely move patients), non-invasive therapeutic products and surfaces, and our information technologies and software solutions. These patient support systems are sold globally and can be designed for use in high, mid, and low acuity settings, depending on the specific design options, and are built to advance mobility, reduce patient falls and caregiver injuries, improve caregiver efficiency and prevent and care for pressure injuries. In addition, we also sell equipment service contracts for our capital equipment, primarily in the United States. Approximately 51%, 50% and 52% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was derived from this segment.
Front Line Care. Our Front Line Care products include our patient monitoring and diagnostics products from Welch Allyn and our respiratory health products. Our patient monitoring and diagnostics products from Welch Allyn include products in each of the following four categories: patient exam and diagnostics, patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and vision screening and diagnostics. Our respiratory health products include the Vest® System, VitalCough® System, MetaNeb® System, Monarch® System and Life2000® System. These products are designed to assist patients in the mobilization of retained blockages that, if not removed, may lead to increased rates of respiratory infection, hospitalization, and reduced lung function. Front Line Care products are sold globally within multiple care settings including primary care, acute care, extended care and home care (primarily respiratory health products). Approximately 34%, 34%, and 32% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were derived from products within this segment.
Surgical Solutions. Our Surgical Solutions products include tables, lights, and pendants utilized within the surgical setting. We also offer a range of positioning devices for use in shoulder, hip, spinal and lithotomy surgeries as well as platform-neutral positioning accessories for nearly every model of operating room table. Approximately 15%, 16%, and 16% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were derived from products within this segment.
We have extensive distribution capabilities and broad reach across all health care settings. We primarily operate in the following channels: (1) sales and rentals of products to acute and extended care facilities worldwide through both a direct sales force and distributors; (2) sales and rentals of products directly to patients in the home; and (3) sales into primary care facilities (primarily Welch Allyn products) through distributors. Through our network of 166 North American and 43 international service centers, and approximately 2,000 service professionals, we provide technical support and services and rapidly deliver our products to customers as-needed, providing our customers flexibility to purchase or rent select products. This extensive network is critical to serving our customers and securing contracts with Group Purchasing Organizations (‘‘GPOs’’) and Integrated Delivery Networks (‘‘IDNs’’).
No single customer represents more than 10% of our revenue.
Raw Materials
Principal materials used in our products for each business segment include carbon steel, aluminum, stainless steel, wood and laminates, petroleum-based products, such as foams and plastics, and other materials, substantially all of which are available from multiple sources. Motors and electronic controls for electrically operated beds and certain other components are purchased from one or more manufacturers.
Prices fluctuate for raw materials and sub-assemblies used in our products based on a number of factors beyond our control. Specifically, the fluctuating prices of certain raw materials, including metals, fuel, plastics and electronic components as well as the impact from incremental China tariff had a direct effect on our profitability. Although we generally have not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases, we have effectively mitigated a portion of the cost pressure through improved operational efficiencies and enhanced supplier management.
Most of our contracts with hospital GPOs and other customers for the sale of products in North America permit us to institute annual list price increases, although we may not always be able to raise prices sufficiently to offset all raw material cost inflation.
Competition
Across our business, we compete on the basis of clinical expertise and resulting product clinical utility and ability to produce favorable outcomes, as well as value, quality, customer service, innovation and breadth of product offerings. We evaluate our competition based on our segments. 
The following table displays our significant competitors with respect to each segment:

Regulatory Matters
FDA Regulation
We design, manufacture, install and distribute medical devices that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and similar agencies in other countries. The regulations and standards of these agencies evolve over time and require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance. The FDA’s Quality System regulations and the regulatory equivalents internationally set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities. From time to time, the FDA performs routine inspections of our facilities and may inform us of certain deficiencies in our processes or facilities. In addition, there are certain state and local government requirements that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
Environmental
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental and health and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in, or derived from, our manufacturing processes. When necessary, we provide reserves in our financial statements for environmental matters. We do not expect the remediation costs for any environmental issues in which we are currently involved to exceed $1.0 million.
Health Care Regulations
In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation in the United States was signed into law through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The health care industry continues to undergo significant change, both in response to this law and in response to other legislative and regulatory actions. In addition to health care reform, Medicare, Medicaid and managed care organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, traditional indemnity insurers and third-party administrators are under increasing pressure to control costs and limit utilization, while improving quality and health care outcomes. These objectives are being advanced through a variety of reform initiatives including, but not limited to, accountable care organizations, value-based purchasing, bundling initiatives and competitive bidding programs. We are also subject to a number of other regulations around the world related to the sale and distribution of health care products. The potential impact of these regulations to our business is discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this Form 10-K.
Product Development
We pursue development of new products and product improvements internally. We maintain professional working relationships with various medical professionals who assist in product research and development. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. Our significant research and development activities are located in Acton, Massachusetts; Batesville, Indiana; Cary, North Carolina; Irvine, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Sarasota, Florida; Skaneateles Falls, New York; Bologna, Italy; Pluvigner, France; Singapore; and Saalfeld and Puchheim, Germany.
Research and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expense in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $139.5 million, $135.6 million and $133.7 million.
In addition, certain software development technology costs for software to be sold or licensed to customers are capitalized as intangibles and are amortized over a period of three to five years once the software is ready for its intended use. The amounts capitalized in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $8.0 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names
We own, and may license from others, a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes, but we do not believe any single patent or related group of patents is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks, trade names and service marks relating to our products and services. Except for the marks “HillromTM”, “Hill-Rom®” and “Welch Allyn®”, we do not believe any single trademark, trade name or service mark is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole.
Foreign Operations
Information about our foreign operations is set forth in tables relating to geographic information in Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 10,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 8% of our employees in the United States (including contingent workers) work under collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a work stoppage in the United States in over 40 years, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. The two collective bargaining agreements at our primary U.S. manufacturing facility expire in January 2021 and January 2022, respectively. We are also subject to various collective bargaining arrangements and/or national trade union agreements outside the United States. Approximately 51% of our employees outside the United States (including contingent workers) work under such arrangements. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for additional information about our employees.
