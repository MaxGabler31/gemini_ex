Acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand
On November 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”), pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement dated July 29, 2020. ANZ includes Torrens University Australia, Think Education, and Media Design School, which together provide diversified student curricula to approximately 19,000 students across five industry verticals, including business, hospitality, health, education, creative technology and design. We believe ANZ represents an attractive portfolio of institutions with a similar focus on innovation, academic outcomes, improved affordability and career advancement as us. We also believe that ANZ provides an attractive platform for future growth, driven by Australia’s status as an attractive destination for international students. 
As of December 31, 2021, our reportable segments consisted of the following:
U.S. Higher Education Segment
Strayer University
Founded in 1892, Strayer University is an institution of higher learning that offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration, accounting, information technology, education, health services administration, public administration, and criminal justice at physical campuses, predominantly located in the eastern United States, and online. Strayer University also offers an executive MBA online through the Jack Welch Management Institute (“JWMI”), which was acquired in December 2011. JWMI is a Top-25 Princeton Review-ranked online MBA program. Strayer University also offers non-degree web and mobile application development courses through Hackbright Academy (“Hackbright”) and Devmountain.
Strayer University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (“Middle States” or “Middle States Commission”), a higher education institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. By offering its programs both online and in physical classrooms, Strayer University provides its working adult students with flexibility and convenience. Strayer University, with its online offerings, attracts students from around the country and throughout the world.
Capella University
Founded in 1993, Capella University is an online post-secondary education institution that offers a variety of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs primarily delivered to working adults. Capella University’s program offerings span the following primary disciplines: arts and sciences; business and technology; counseling and human services; education; nursing and health sciences; psychology; and public service leadership.
Capella University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (the “Higher Learning Commission” or “HLC”), a higher education institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. Capella University focuses on master's and doctoral degrees, with approximately 65% of its students enrolled in a master’s or doctoral degree program. Its academic offerings are built with competency-based curricula and designed to demonstrate competencies through real-world, authentic assessments delivered in an online format that is both convenient and flexible.
Australia/New Zealand Segment
Founded in 2013, Torrens University is the only investor-funded University in Australia. Torrens University offers undergraduate, graduate, higher degree by research, and specialized degree courses primarily in five fields of study: business, design and creative technology, health, hospitality, and education. Courses are offered both online and on physical campuses. Torrens University is registered with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (“TEQSA”), the regulator for higher education providers and universities throughout Australia, as an Australian University that is authorized to self-accredit its courses.
Think Education is a vocational registered training organization and accredited higher education provider in Australia. Think Education delivers education at several campuses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide as well as through online study. Think Education and its colleges are accredited in Australia by TEQSA and the Australian Skills Quality Authority (“ASQA”), the regulator for vocational education and training organizations that operate in Australia.

Media Design School is accredited in New Zealand by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (“NZQA”), the organization responsible for the quality assurance of non-university tertiary training providers. 
Education Technology Services Segment
Our Education Technology Services segment is primarily focused on developing and maintaining relationships with employers to build employee education benefits programs that provide employees with access to affordable and industry relevant training, certificate, and degree programs. The employer relationships developed by the Education Technology Services division are an important source of student enrollment for Strayer University and Capella University, and the majority of the revenue attributed to the Education Technology Services division is driven by the volume of enrollment derived from these employer relationships. Education Technology Services also supports employer partners through Workforce Edge, a platform which provides employers a full-service education benefits administration solution, and Sophia Learning, which enables lower cost education benefits programs through the use of low-cost online general education courses recommended by the American Council on Education for credit at other colleges and universities.
Industry Background
The United States market for post-secondary education is large, fragmented, and competitive. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the total number of post-secondary students enrolled as of the fall of 2020 was 19.4 million, reflecting a 10.4% decrease from record enrollment in the fall of 2010. Approximately 1.3 million of these students attended proprietary institutions. Controversy about the cost of higher education, under-employment of many college graduates, and persistent negative media coverage have caused some prospective students to question the value proposition of higher education. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the number of students enrolled in post-secondary education institutions in recent years. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, college enrollments in all higher education sectors declined 2.5% and 2.7% in the fall of 2020 and 2021, respectively. Enrollment at proprietary colleges increased 5.3% in the fall of 2020 and declined 9.3% in the fall 2021. The industry is heavily dependent on continued availability of funding for programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV programs”), and concerns about potential reductions in such funding also could negatively affect demand for higher education.
Notwithstanding weaker demand dynamics over the past few years, including the more recent impact on enrollment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that over time, demand for post-secondary education in the United States will increase as a result of demographic, economic, and social trends. The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that approximately 61.6 million adults over the age of 25 in the United States do not have more than a high school education, and approximately 34.0 million adults over the age of 25 have some college experience but have not completed a college degree. Other trends that could positively affect demand for our programs include:
•increasing demand by employers for certain types of professional and skilled workers;
•growth in the number of high school graduates from 2.8 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated 3.7 million in 2021-2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics;
•the significant and measurable income premium and enhanced employment prospects attributable to post-secondary education;
•a number of initiatives underway to reduce the cost of a post-secondary education; and
•continued demand from working adults for programs offered by accredited institutions.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding closure of Australia's borders, the Australian higher education market experienced consistent growth. In 2019, Australian higher education enrollments totaled approximately 1.6 million, compared to 1.1 million in 2009, resulting in a 42% increase in total enrollments over the 10 year period. The number of international students enrolled in Australian higher education institutions grew from 0.3 million in 2009 to 0.5 million in 2019. The Australian higher education market is expected to continue growing in the coming years, with a significant share of growth expected from international students. However, due to Australia closing its borders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, international enrollments have declined in recent years and will likely not return to growth until Australia's borders are fully reopened.
Competition
The post-secondary education market is highly competitive, with no private or public institution holding a significant market share. Strayer University, Capella University, and Torrens University (the “Universities”) compete primarily with traditional public and private degree-granting accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting accredited schools, and alternatives to higher education. In addition, we face competition from various non-traditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs, provided by proprietary, public, and not-for-profit providers, including massive open online courses offered worldwide without charge by traditional educational institutions and other direct-to-consumer education services. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence and colleges in states that offer various forms of “free college” programs. As online learning matures as a modality for education delivery across higher education, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase.
We believe the key factors affecting our competitive position include the quality of our programs offered, the quality of other services provided to students, our reputation among students and in the general marketplace, the cost and perceived value of our offerings, the employment rate and terms of employment for our graduates, the ease of access to our offerings, the quality and reputation of our faculty and other employees, the quality of our campus facilities and online platforms, the time commitment required to complete our programs and obtain a degree, the quality and size of our alumni base, and our relationship with other learning institutions.
Company Strengths
We have a track record of providing practical and convenient education programs and solutions for working adults, employers, and recent high school graduates. Following our merger with Capella Education Company and our acquisition of ANZ, we have retained the individual strengths of our independently operated universities while creating a combined corporate and shared-service platform and best practice sharing, both of which help us deliver significant benefits to students. We believe the following strengths position us to capitalize on the demand for post-secondary education:
•Focus on Innovation. We value innovation and actively invest in the educational experience to improve student success and employment outcomes, while also addressing challenges including the affordability of higher education and meeting the skill requirements of employers. Capella University’s competency-based learning infrastructure and direct assessment capabilities, Strayer University’s video, simulation and content capabilities, and Torrens University's virtual career expo are examples of this drive to transform education delivery and learning by working adults. As a combined Company, the Universities can leverage these transformational capabilities.
•Consistent operating history. Strayer University, Capella University, and Torrens University have been in continuous operation since 1892, 1993, and 2013, respectively, and all three institutions have demonstrated an ability to operate consistently and grow profitably. The combined Company has continued this track record, with a broader, more diversified product offering, a balanced revenue mix, cost and revenue synergies, and greater scale.
•Practical and diversified programs. We offer programs in practical areas of adult education. In order to keep pace with a changing knowledge-based economy, we constantly strive to meet the evolving needs of our students and their current and prospective employers by regularly refining, updating, and adding to our portfolio of educational programs. We have a diversified program portfolio that includes Strayer University’s programs in business, including the Jack Welch Management Institute, accounting, economics and information technology, Capella University’s competency-based programs in healthcare and counseling, as well as a robust doctoral portfolio, and ANZ's post-graduate programs in business administration, information systems and public health, its renowned Blue Mountains International Hotel Management and Billy Blue Design schools, accredited nursing bachelor's degree and award-winning creative and digital technology qualifications. This program diversity helps us better meet the educational needs of students in the modern economy.
•Focus on adults pursuing career-relevant degree and non-degree programs. We focus on serving adults who are pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as non-degree certificates and training programs that will help them advance their careers and employment opportunities. We provide high quality student support services such as advising, writing, tutoring and research support; administrative services; library services; financial aid counseling; and career counseling. Increasingly, we are leveraging data and analytics to create personalized experiences for our students, which are reflected in our early cohort persistence improvements and continued high student satisfaction.
•Flexible program offerings. We offer flexible programs that allow students to attend classes and complete coursework during the day, in the evening, and on weekends throughout the calendar year at the student's convenience through our comprehensive online program offerings.
•Attractive and convenient campus locations. Physical presences continue to be an important strength for us, notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of academic activity occurs online. Strayer University has campuses and campus centers that are attractive and modern, offering conducive learning environments in convenient locations, and provide many online students with a physical location to study and to meet with admissions officers and academic advisors. These physical campuses and campus centers are unique in comparison to most online education programs and positions Strayer University to support its online learners more effectively. ANZ campuses are located in central business districts of major cities across Australia and New Zealand, with accessibility and proximity to industry partners, and offer a focused and personal learning experience to their students. 
•Established brand names and alumni support. Strayer University and Capella University are established brand names in post-secondary adult education. Their students and graduates are effective ambassadors of both brands through their work at companies across corporate America and, along with our growing alumni networks, foster greater brand awareness and additional referral opportunities for new students. ANZ continues to build the reputation and brand awareness of Torrens University through the success of its students and graduates, its research programs and its relationships with key industry partners, while also leveraging the existing strengths in its established college brands, and Think Education and Media Design School businesses.
Company Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading innovator and provider of career-relevant and meaningful education programs that prepare students for advancement in their careers and professional lives, and promote economic mobility. We have identified the following strategic priorities as key to achieving our goal:
•Improve student success — Our success depends on the success of our students. The more we focus on helping our students succeed, the more likely it is that we will succeed. In order to improve student success, we must continue to hire outstanding faculty, produce high quality academic content, and employ cutting edge technology that enables us to deploy faculty and content in increasingly efficient and effective ways.
•Enhance student experience — Our students are predominately working adults who are furthering their education in order to advance their careers and professional lives. Our students are busy with work and family responsibilities that leave little time for other endeavors. Thus, we make every effort to make all interactions with our students productive, and we are constantly looking for ways to serve them better. This initiative includes leveraging technology, including artificial intelligence and automation, to improve student support in the areas of advising, tutoring, registration, campus and online technology, and administration. We measure our performance through student surveys and focus groups as well as through metrics like persistence, continuation, and return on student investment.
•Address affordability — Recognizing that affordability is a significant factor in a prospective student’s decision to further his or her education, we have implemented various initiatives to make our programs more affordable. For example, through the Graduation Fund at Strayer University, qualifying students enrolled in a bachelor’s or master's degree program are eligible to receive one free course for every three courses successfully completed towards a bachelor’s degree. The free courses earned are redeemable in one’s final academic year. Additionally, Capella University’s FlexPath direct assessment model provides opportunity to drive affordability through the potential for lower tuition costs, reduced time to completion, and increased flexibility. The Universities have also instituted various other tuition reductions and scholarships. Through the Sophia Learning education platform, we provide low-cost online general education courses recommended by the American Council on Education for credit at other colleges and universities, which can dramatically lower the cost of getting a degree. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of our affordability initiatives and explore other ways to make our offerings as affordable as possible. We are also focused on deploying new, more aggressive technology innovations, including artificial intelligence and automation, which enable us to lower our operating costs and thus improve our ability to support lower tuition.
•Establish new platforms for growth — We are continuously looking for new ways to leverage our existing resources and capabilities to accelerate growth and expand benefits to our students through our best-in-class processes and practices and through opportunistic business combinations. In 2018, we launched SEI Ventures, which is a seed-stage venture fund that supports pioneering education tech start-ups focused on transformational technologies that improve student success. In addition to providing capital, the venture fund offers portfolio companies the opportunity to pilot technologies at our U.S. based universities and our coding boot camps, subject to compliance with applicable laws. We also continue to develop new programs and concentrations. We are actively building relationships with employers to create employee education benefits programs that provide employees with access to affordable and industry relevant training, certificate and degree programs. These relationships are an important source of corporate-funded enrollment for Strayer University and Capella University. Our Workforce Edge platform, which provides a full-service education benefits administration solution to employers, is also positioned to drive enrollment in our universities that is less reliant on federal funding.
•Build a high performing culture — In order to be a leading provider of educational services, we must have talented and motivated faculty and employees who are passionate about serving students. We strive to attract the best talent and then develop and retain them. We want to be known as an employer of choice and be a place where one can build a long-term career.
U.S. Higher Education (“USHE”) Segment
The USHE segment provides flexible and affordable certificate and degree programs to working adults primarily through Strayer University and Capella University (the “USHE Universities”), including the Jack Welch Management Institute MBA, which is a unit of Strayer University. USHE also offers non-degree web and mobile application development courses through Hackbright Academy and Devmountain, which are units of Strayer University.
Student Profile
The following is a breakdown of students by program level enrolled in the USHE Universities as of the 2021 fall term:

Program | Strayer University students | Capella University students | | Total USHE students | Percentage of USHE students 
Bachelor’s | 30,420 | | 13,170 | | 43,590 | 55 | %
Master’s | 6,707 | | 18,537 | | 25,244 | 32 | %
Doctoral | — | | 7,778 | | 7,778 | 10 | %
Associate's | 1,266 | | — | | 1,266 | 2 | %
Other* | 59 | | 784 | | 843 | 1 | %
Total Students | 38,452 | | 40,269 | | 78,721 | 100 | %

___________________________________________________________
*Other primarily comprised of students enrolled in certificate programs.
The USHE segment has a very diverse student population. Of the students enrolled in the USHE Universities programs as of the 2021 fall term, approximately 70% were age 31 or older, approximately 81% were engaged in part-time study, approximately 77% were female, and approximately 58% of students self-reporting their ethnicity were minorities.
The USHE business is seasonal, and as a result, its quarterly results of operations tend to vary within the year due to student enrollment patterns. Enrollment generally is lowest in the third quarter, or summer term.
Strayer University
Strayer University is an institution of higher learning that offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business, information technology, education, health services administration, public administration, and criminal justice at physical campuses, predominantly located in the eastern United States, and online. Strayer University is accredited by the Middle States Commission, a higher education institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. By offering its programs both online and in physical classrooms, Strayer University provides its working adult students more flexibility and convenience.
Curriculum
Strayer University offers business, information technology, and professional curricula to equip students with specialized and practical knowledge and skills for careers in business, industry, and government. Academic leaders regularly review and revise Strayer University’s course offerings to improve its educational programs and respond to competitive changes in job markets. Strayer University regularly evaluates new programs and degrees to stay current with the needs of students and their employers.
Although most of its programs are offered at campuses and online, Strayer University adapts its course offerings to the demands of the student population at each location. Strayer University students may enroll in courses at more than one campus and take some or all of their courses online.
Strayer University structures its curricula to allow students to advance sequentially from one learning level to another by applying credits earned in one program toward attainment of a more advanced degree. For example, a student originally pursuing an associate’s degree in information systems can extend his or her original educational objective by taking additional courses leading to a bachelor’s degree in information systems, and ultimately a master’s degree in information systems. This curriculum design provides students a level of competency and a measure of attainment in the event they interrupt their education or choose to work in their field of concentration prior to obtaining their final degree.
Online
Strayer University has been offering courses online since 1997. Currently, all students taking classes online do so in the asynchronous format. Students may take all of their courses online or take online courses in combination with classroom-based courses. A student taking classes online has the same admission and financial aid requirements, is subject to substantially the same policies and procedures, and receives the same student services and support as a student taking their course on-campus. Tuition for online courses is the same as campus-based courses.
Faculty
Strayer University appoints faculty who hold appropriate academic credentials, are dedicated, active professionals in their fields, and are enthusiastic and committed to teaching working adults. In accordance with Strayer University’s educational mission, Strayer University faculty members focus their efforts only on teaching and student support, and not on research and/or publishing. The normal course load for a full-time faculty member is five courses per quarter for each of three quarters, or 15 courses per academic year. Certain high-performing faculty have been promoted into what we call “10x” teaching roles where they are provided with new technology and support resources that enable them to teach much larger class cohorts than was previously possible.
None of Strayer University's employees are a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement. Strayer University provides financial support for faculty members seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge through a professional development funding program that reimburses eligible faculty and deans for continuing their education and completing courses, seminars, and various programs that enhance their current credentials and knowledge base to improve their content expertise. Full-time faculty (and all other full-time employees) receive a 100% discount for all Strayer University courses. Strayer University also conducts annual in-house faculty workshops in each discipline. We believe that Strayer University’s dedicated and capable faculty is one of the keys to its success.
Organization of Strayer University
Overall academic and business decisions of Strayer University, including review and approval of the annual financial budget, are directed by its Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees consists of Dr. Charlotte F. Beason, Chairwoman, and currently nine other members. Strayer University’s By-Laws prescribe that a majority of members be independent from Strayer University and the Company to assure independent oversight of all academic programs and services. Of the ten members, six are independent. The Boards of Trustees of Stayer University and Capella University are independent of each other, as well as from the Board of Directors of Torrens University, and have no overlapping members.
Within the academic, strategic and financial parameters set by the Board of Trustees, Strayer University is managed on a daily basis by the Strayer University President. The President is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the policies established by the Board of Trustees and is supported in this function by senior administrative officers, including the Provost/Chief Academic Officer of Strayer University. The majority of Strayer University’s operations are centralized within the President’s Office or Strayer University’s senior administrative staff offices.
Outreach
To identify potential students, Strayer University engages in a broad range of activities to inform working adults and their employers about the programs offered. These activities include direct, digital, and social media marketing, marketing to existing students and graduates, print and broadcast advertising, student referrals, and corporate and government outreach activities. Direct response methods (direct, digital, and social media marketing) are used to generate inquiries from potential students. Information relevant to prospective students is published on the website, www.strayer.edu. Strayer University maintains booths and information tables at various conferences and expos, as well as at transfer days at community colleges. Recommendations from our alumni network also maintain and enhance Strayer University’s reputation and promote its quality education. Its business-to-business outreach efforts include personal telephone calls, distribution of information through corporate intranets and human resource departments, and on-site information meetings. Strayer University records inquiries in its database and tracks them through to application and registration. Additionally, information about new programs is provided to students and alumni to encourage them to return for further education.
Student Admissions
Students attending Strayer University’s undergraduate programs must possess a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (“GED”) Certificate. Students attending Strayer University’s graduate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution and meet certain other requirements. If a student’s undergraduate major varies widely from the student’s proposed graduate course of study, certain undergraduate prerequisite courses may also be necessary for admission. To maximize undergraduate students’ chances for academic success and to give them the support they need, Strayer University evaluates incoming students’ proficiency in fundamental English and math prior to the first quarter’s registration.
International students applying for admission must meet the same admission requirements as other students. Those students whose native language is not English must provide evidence that they are able to use the English language with sufficient facility to perform college-level work in an English-speaking institution.
Tuition and Fees
Strayer University charges tuition by the course. Tuition rates vary based on degree level and program. In addition, tuition rates may vary in states with specific regulations governing tuition costs. Tuition rates are reviewed at least annually. Year-over-year tuition adjustments are specific to the degree level or program and depend on market conditions, program differentiation or changes in operating costs associated with the degree level or program
Strayer University offers scholarships and tuition discounts to students under a variety of different programs and in connection with various corporate and government sponsorship and tuition reimbursement arrangements. One of these programs, the Graduation Fund, offers a student in a bachelor’s or master's program an opportunity to earn up to a 25% reduction of the tuition required for a degree. A new undergraduate student who has no transfer credit, seeks to obtain a bachelor’s degree in four years, and is eligible for the Graduation Fund will pay on average approximately $11,000 per year in tuition.
Career Development Services
Although most of Strayer University’s students are already employed, Strayer University actively assists its students and alumni with career-related matters. The focus for Career Services at Strayer University is to provide career guidance and resources to assist students and alumni in reaching their educational and professional goals. Services are delivered through various media including online, in person, recorded video, books, periodicals, and by telephone. The services provided include career webinars, recorded seminars, career teleconferences, career advising, and resume review.
Capella University
Capella University is an institution of higher learning that offers a variety of doctoral, master’s, and bachelor’s degree programs, primarily for working adults. Capella University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a higher education institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. Capella University's academic offerings are built with competency-based curricula and are delivered in an online format that is convenient and flexible. Capella University designs its offerings to help working adult students develop specific competencies they can apply in their workplace. 
Curriculum
Capella University’s program offerings span the following primary disciplines: arts and sciences; business and technology; counseling and human services; education; nursing and health sciences; psychology; and public service leadership. Capella University's GuidedPath credit-hour courses are offered on a quarterly academic schedule, which generally coincides with calendar quarters. Capella University offers new students in most programs the flexibility to begin the first course in their program of study at the beginning of any month. These students then enroll in subsequent courses on a regular quarterly course schedule. Depending on the program, students generally enroll in one to two courses per quarter. Each course has a designated start date, and the majority of courses last for ten weeks.
To meet traditional Capella University best practices, GuidedPath students typically need to access the online courseroom multiple times each week. However, the courses are developed to be taken asynchronously, so that students can attend each course as it fits their weekly schedule. GuidedPath students are required to respond to questions posed by the instructor, as well as comments made by other students. This format provides for an interactive experience in which each student is both encouraged and required to be actively engaged. Faculty are also required to have substantive engagement in each course each week. Additional learning activities may include reading, simulations, team projects and/or research papers. Capella University’s online format provides a digital record of student interactions for the course instructor to assess students’ levels of engagement and demonstration of required competencies. The course design also includes assessment of course competencies.
In the FlexPath model, students’ demonstration of competencies is directly assessed by faculty when the student submits an assessment. FlexPath students set their own deadlines, demonstrate competencies via authentic assessment, and move through courses at their own speed, giving them an opportunity to accelerate or slow down to meet their learning needs and schedule demands.
The primary exception to Capella University’s online format is for doctoral programs and for certain master’s degree programs related to professional licensure. These students participate in periodic residencies, year-in-residencies, and supervised practica and internships as a complement to their courses. Residencies typically last from four to 12 days and are required, on average, once per year for students in applicable programs. The supervised practica and internships vary in length based on the program in which the student is enrolled.
Capella University also offers certificate programs, which consist of a series of courses focused on a particular area of study, for students who seek to enhance their skills and knowledge. Online certificate courses can be taken to prepare for an undergraduate degree program, graduate degree program or on a stand-alone basis. The duration of certificate programs ranges from two quarters to approximately two years.
Faculty
Capella University hires faculty who have teaching and/or practitioner experience in their particular discipline and possess significant and appropriate academic credentials. The faculty consists of full-time academic administrators, core faculty and part-time faculty. The full-time academic administrators’ primary responsibilities are to monitor the quality and relevance of curricula, to recruit and manage teaching faculty, and to maintain standards of accreditation. Faculty are supervised by academic leaders within their schools. Core faculty and part-time faculty teach courses, serve on curriculum or other relevant committees, work on curriculum development in their areas of expertise, and serve as comprehensive exam and dissertation mentors to doctoral students.
None of Capella University’s employees are a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with Capella University. Prior to offering a teaching assignment, Capella University provides significant training to new faculty members, including an online development program focused on the Capella University way of effective online teaching, its educational philosophy, teaching expectations and its online platform. In addition, professional development and training is provided for all faculty members on an ongoing basis. To evaluate the performance of faculty members, courseroom activity is regularly monitored and assessments are made with respect to both student satisfaction with the courseroom experience and student performance against course outcomes.
Organization of Capella University
Overall academic and business decisions of Capella University, including review of the annual financial budget, are directed by its Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees consists of Dr. Eric Jolly, Chairman, and currently eleven other members. Capella University’s By-Laws prescribe that a majority of members be independent from Capella University and the Company to provide independent oversight of all academic programs and services. Of the twelve members, nine are 
independent. The Boards of Trustees of Stayer University and Capella University are independent of each other, as well as from the Board of Directors of Torrens University, and have no overlapping members.
Within the academic, strategic and financial parameters set by the Board of Trustees, Capella University is managed on a daily basis by the Capella University President. The President is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the policies established by the Board of Trustees and is supported in this function by senior administrative officers, including the Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs of Capella University. 
Outreach
Capella University engages in a range of relationship-based marketing activities to build the Capella brand, differentiate it from other educational providers, increase awareness and consideration with prospective students, generate inquiries for enrollment, and stimulate referrals from current students and graduates. These marketing activities may include Internet, television, print, radio, email, social media, and direct mail advertising campaigns. Other marketing activities include supportive outreach to current students, participation in seminars and trade shows, and development of key marketing relationships with corporate, healthcare, armed forces, government, and educational organizations. Online advertising (display, social, mobile, search, and through aggregators) currently generates the largest volume of inquiries from prospective students.
Student Admissions
Capella University’s admission process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a post-secondary education while providing feedback to students regarding their ability to complete their chosen program successfully. Prior to the first course in their program of study, students are generally required to complete an orientation to online education and a skills assessment, the results of which help develop an understanding of the specific needs and readiness of each individual student. Students must successfully complete the first course in their program of study to continue their education.
Students enrolling in bachelor’s programs must have a high school diploma or a GED and demonstrate competence in writing and logical reasoning during the first course of their program of study. Additionally, applicants to undergraduate programs who do not have transferable credits from an accredited higher education institution are required to pass assessments in writing and reading prior to acceptance into the program. Students enrolling in graduate programs must have the requisite undergraduate academic degree from an accredited institution and a specified minimum grade point average. In addition to standard admission requirements, Capella University requires applicants to some programs to provide additional application material and information and/or interview with and be approved by faculty.
Tuition and Fees
Capella University's overall tuition rates vary by discipline, length of program, and degree level.
Students in the GuidedPath credit hour programs are charged tuition on a per course or per term basis. Per course prices vary by discipline, number of credit hours, and degree level. Students in select doctoral programs are charged tuition at a fixed quarterly amount, regardless of the number of courses for which the student registers. 
Tuition for FlexPath doctoral, master's and bachelor's programs is priced at a flat, fixed amount for each 12-week subscription period. There is no maximum course load during each subscription period; however, a maximum of two FlexPath courses can be taken at any one time. 
Students in credit hour certificate programs are charged tuition on a per course basis, which varies by discipline and the number of credit hours.
Tuition rates are reviewed at least annually. Year-over-year tuition adjustments are specific to the program or specialization and depend on market conditions, program differentiation or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations.
Capella University offers scholarships and tuition discounts, under a variety of different programs, to members of the armed forces and in connection with various corporate, healthcare, federal and educational marketing relationships, for example:

Enrollment counselors also assist with prospective students’ selection of the Capella University program and specialization that best suits their professional aspirations.
Australia/New Zealand Segment
The Australia/New Zealand segment is comprised of Torrens University, Think Education, and Media Design School (collectively the “ANZ Institutions”) that together offer undergraduate, graduate, higher degree by research, and specialized degree courses as well as vocational programs in Australia and New Zealand.
Student Profile
Students attending the ANZ Institutions primarily consist of recent high school graduates as well as working adults. The student population includes domestic students, representing citizens or permanent residents of Australia and New Zealand, and international students. Approximately half of students are international students that are attending classes in person (typically on a student visa), at a foreign partner campus, or online.
Curriculum
The ANZ Institutions offer undergraduate, graduate, higher degree by research, and specialized degree courses as well as vocational programs primarily focused in five key disciplines: business, design and creative technology, health, hospitality, and education. The variety of educational programs offered include both accredited and non-accredited courses that are offered online, in person at physical campuses, or a combination of online and in person. The ANZ Institutions have strong industry partnerships and design the majority of their courses in collaboration with these industry partners. Further, a significant portion of the teaching staff also work in the industry related to the subject/discipline in which they teach and are therefore industry-connected subject matter experts.
Faculty
The faculty at ANZ Institutions include both full-time and part-time faculty members. In Australia and New Zealand, the primary qualification faculty members must have to teach at an institution of higher education is a degree that is at least one level higher than the relevant discipline they are teaching, in order to demonstrate their advanced skills, knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.
Torrens University is required to have a robust and active research agenda in order to maintain its registration as a University. As such, all faculty are expected to be involved in scholarship and/or research programs. Torrens University has an outstanding group of senior research leaders in the disciplines of artificial intelligence and health, and are forming new research groups in business, design, education, and disability.
All new faculty are required to complete an academic on-boarding program, which includes an introduction to the institution they are joining. The on-boarding program is followed by a rolling schedule of training sessions and symposiums 
during the year addressing key topics relating to teaching and learning, thus enabling staff to continuously develop their skills and remain up-to-date with new developments. In addition, an Academic Professional Development program is available to all academic staff, which provides opportunities from core competency development to advanced teaching methodologies. These programs are delivered as formal trainings, national symposiums, online facilitated seminars, informal community-based professional learning events and access to a learning and teaching resource repository and network. In addition, all staff at the ANZ Institutions are able to take any course at the ANZ Institutions free of charge. 
Organization of the ANZ Institutions
Each ANZ Institution has a local Governing Board, as well as an Academic Board that oversees all three institutions. The Governing Board meets at least quarterly and provides oversight of the management of the institutions, which includes providing input into strategic direction, risk management, academic governance, reporting and disclosure, performance, corporate governance and delegations. The Academic Board, on delegated authority from the Governing Board, has principal responsibility for quality assurance of all academic activities of the institutions, including the maintenance of high standards in teaching and scholarship. The Executive Leadership team oversees the operational leadership and strategic direction of the institutions with clear delegations and direction from each of the institution’s Governing Boards.
Outreach
Marketing and sales initiatives vary depending on the type of prospective students being targeted. Marketing to international students is primarily delivered through international agents and events that are largely relationship-based while marketing to domestic students is primarily delivered digitally. These marketing activities include digital paid campaigns, social media engagement as well as events such as open days for students to come learn about the institutions, seminars or webinars that are offered both in person and virtual, as well as through high school career fairs or agents’ career fairs for international students.
Student Admissions
Torrens University and Think Education (Australia)
Students enrolling in higher education undergraduate courses must satisfy minimum admission criteria and any course prerequisites. The admission requirements vary based on an applicant's current level of education and work experience. Students enrolling in higher education graduate courses must demonstrate their ability to undertake postgraduate studies in the proposed field. The admission criteria are course-specific and may include formal qualifications at the Australian Qualifications Framework (“AQF”) Level 7 or above, a combination of formal qualifications and relevant professional experience, or extensive high-level relevant professional experience. All applications for postgraduate courses are assessed on an individual basis. In addition, when applying for postgraduate study, applicants may be considered under the guidelines of Special Entry and Educational Access Schemes designed to broaden access to the University, address perceived disadvantage or encourage studies in particular disciplines. This group includes, but is not limited to, applicants with physical disabilities, applicants from geographically isolated areas, applicants with economically disadvantaged backgrounds and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander applicants.
Students enrolling in a vocational education and training program must meet minimum requirements for admission including any course specific requirements and English language requirements. In addition, domestic applicants who wish to access vocational education and training (“VET”) student loans will be assessed to establish if they have the aptitude to complete the qualification. Evidence to demonstrate this aptitude includes a completed Australian secondary education or equivalent, or a qualification at the level or below an applicant’s desired course according to the AQF. 
Media Design School (New Zealand)
Students enrolling in undergraduate courses at Media Design School must have formal academic qualifications from a secondary or tertiary-level school. The specific entry requirements are program-specific and may include interviews, portfolios, work and life experience, informal and non-formal learning, or a combination of these methods. Students enrolling in graduate level courses must demonstrate their capacity to undertake postgraduate studies in their proposed field. The admission requirements are program-specific and may include formal qualifications, extensive relevant professional experience, or a combination of formal qualifications and relevant professional experience. In addition, applicants must provide evidence of meeting the English language proficiency level required by each program and as required by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.
Tuition and Fees
The ANZ Institutions charge tuition by subject and the tuition rates vary by subject. Tuition rates are reviewed at least annually. In addition, the ANZ Institutions offer a range of scholarships and discounts to students that are both merit-based and based on specific circumstances.
Career Development Services
Career development services are offered through the Careers Connect platform, which is a digital platform available to students on-demand. Through the platform students can access resume and cover letter review services; search and apply for jobs; search and apply for volunteering, work-integrated learning, industry placements and virtual internships; complete virtual mock interviews; access online resources and webinars relating to job search, career planning, and graduate employment; and view and register for careers and industry-related events. The ANZ Institutions also partner with Forage and Practera to bring students free virtual work experience to help them build their employability skills. These short experiences, developed by global industry leaders, help students gain practical work skills and receive a certificate upon completion.
In addition, each student is assigned a Success Coach upon starting their course of study to help prepare and connect the student to their chosen industry. The Success Coach's focus is to improve the employability of each student by using their industry knowledge to maximize the impact of the student's application and presentation of their personal brand.
Education Technology Services Segment
Our Education Technology Services segment is primarily focused on developing and maintaining relationships with employers to build employee education benefits programs that provide employees with access to affordable and industry relevant training, certificate, and degree programs. The employer relationships developed by the Education Technology Services division are an important source of student enrollment for Strayer University and Capella University, and the majority of the revenue attributed to the Education Technology Services division is driven by the volume of enrollment derived from these employer relationships. Education Technology Services also supports employer partners through Workforce Edge, a platform which provides employers a full-service education benefits administration solution, and Sophia Learning, which enables lower cost education benefits programs through the use of low-cost online general education courses recommended by the American Council on Education for credit at other colleges and universities.

SEI is committed to operating transparently and with the highest standards of integrity. Our guiding principles and leadership behaviors emphasize student-centric priorities and drive us as we continue to build a vibrant, diverse and inclusive culture. Recurring organization health surveys offer employees a way to share feedback with senior leaders on priorities, leadership culture, and the workplace, and are used to shape Company goals. The executive leadership team hosts frequent Company-wide town hall meetings and mentoring sessions that inform employees about the Company’s initiatives and results and provide insight on skills and attributes that drive success. The Company also supports numerous platforms for employee engagement, such as community and employee network groups which provide opportunities for employees to experience an inclusive community at SEI through development opportunities, informal mentoring and volunteering. 
SEI honors and celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) as core institutional principles. The Company is fully engaged in cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce and environment that reflects all stakeholders. This activity is aligned with SEI’s commitment to advancing diversity in key roles. In 2019, the Company launched the CEO’s Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, an advisory council which is charged with promoting DEI initiatives across the organization. In 2021, we continued our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and established a DEI Programs Team; appointed from amongst our leadership a Chief Diversity Officer for the Company; and the presidents of Strayer and Capella Universities appointed university-level Diversity Officers. The DEI Programs Team continues to shape and drive forward our enterprise diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy.
The Company is dedicated to attracting, developing and retaining top talent. SEI offers compensation and benefits that are market-competitive and performance-based. The compensation programs and policies reflect the Company’s commitment to reward performance that aligns with its values and priorities. SEI offers a comprehensive benefits package focused on ensuring our employees are empowered to maintain a healthy work-life balance, a healthy living lifestyle, and financial wellness. SEI's benefits package includes traditional health and wellness benefits, as well as programs to assist employees' in accumulating wealth through the Company sponsored 401(k) Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the United States and through the Company's contributions to the superannuation fund on behalf of employees in Australia. The Company also provides generous paid time off, a wellness plan, paid parental and military leave, as well as giving back & volunteer time.
SEI fosters the growth and career development of its employees by creating solutions that support employees to deliver high performance, grow their careers, and contribute to SEI’s mission to enable economic mobility of its students through education. The Company provides opportunities for eligible employees and dependents to attain and enhance their career goals through our Tuition Assistance Program, which provides generous financial support for undergraduate and graduate courses at Strayer University, including the Jack Welch Management Institute, Capella University, and continuing education through Sophia Learning. In addition, the Company provides support for faculty members and employees seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge through professional development opportunities and continuing education. Online learning resources are available that cover a broad range of skills, including leadership, professional development, innovation, communication and technology. The Company has also prioritized identifying high-performing employees to accelerate their development and foster a strong, diverse succession pipeline.
Environmental Responsibilities
SEI is dedicated to creating economic mobility for working adults through innovative learning programs. In our pursuit of this mission, we maintain physical locations to support our employees and students, and are committed to managing these facilities in a manner that minimizes the environmental impact in the communities where we work and live. The Company strives to uphold environmental practices that reduce climate change risks from energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and waste generation. These practices include: 
•Reducing the physical footprint of corporate offices and campuses reduces energy consumption, water usage, and waste generation
◦The Company's near-term goals include reducing the size of its overall footprint by more than 25% compared to the square footage occupied in 2020, by implementing more efficient workspace design and eliminating underused campus facilities.
•Reducing energy consumption, including from non-renewable energy resources
◦Strayer University and Capella University offer robust online curriculums, with the majority of instruction delivered online at Stayer University and 100% of instruction delivered online at Capella University; this online curriculum gives students the ability to access and complete coursework online, reducing the need for physical space and commuting, which in turn reduces energy and water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation.
◦Much of SEI's workforce is accustomed to working remotely, again reducing the need for physical space and commuting, which in turn reduces energy and water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation.
◦Our Minneapolis, MN corporate office is located within a LEED Gold certified building (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), which is a U.S. Green Building Council certification.
◦The Herndon, VA corporate office is located in a building that is benchmarked within the ENERGY STAR program, which is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy focused on protecting the environment through energy efficient products and practices.
◦SEI is investing in energy-saving interior design options, including updated lighting packages with more efficient LED lighting; occupancy sensors to reduce energy consumption in areas that are not being used; and programmable heating and cooling systems that will run only during operating hours.
◦Within campus locations, many property management teams are equipping spaces with energy-saving features including more efficient LED lighting, motion sensor lighting, and energy efficient HVAC systems.
◦As a provider of online education, data centers are a critical component of business operations; one of SEI’s largest power usages from a data center is from a data center powered entirely by renewable wind energy.
•Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
◦In an effort to focus on alternative, green-commuting options, employees are encouraged to consider public transportation; for employees in Minneapolis, MN, SEI covers a portion of public transit costs as an employee benefit.
◦Vehicle charging stations have been installed at the corporate office in Herndon, VA to support employees that choose to utilize or purchase alternative fuel vehicles. 
◦Many campus city locations are located near mass transportation options. 
•Reducing water usage
◦Our Herndon, VA and Minneapolis, MN corporate offices and certain campus locations use water efficient fixtures to decrease the amount of water usage. 
•Reducing waste generation from business operations
◦SEI has a national contract with a document management company which provides corporate and campus locations with shredding bins on-site to allow sensitive business materials to be disposed of securely and recycled.
◦The Herndon, VA and Minneapolis, MN corporate offices have recycling bins in breakrooms to encourage employees to recycle products, and many campus facilities also have recycling programs.
•Additional efforts to reduce environmental impacts
◦Green cleaning products are utilized at both the Herndon, VA and Minneapolis, MN corporate offices to reduce impacts to the environment.
◦Within certain campus locations, janitorial companies also use green cleaning products to reduce impacts to the environment.

Regulation
U.S. Regulatory Environment
As institutionally accredited institutions of higher education operating in multiple jurisdictions, Strayer University and Capella University are subject to accreditation rules and varying state licensing and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Higher Education Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require all higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs, including Strayer University and Capella University, to comply with detailed substantive and reporting requirements and to undergo periodic regulatory scrutiny. The Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibility for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education (“Secretary of Education”); (2) state education regulatory bodies; and (3) the federal government through the Department of Education. Our business activities are planned and implemented to achieve compliance with the rules and regulations of the state, regional and federal agencies that regulate our activities. We have established regulatory compliance and management systems and processes under the oversight of our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel that are designed to meet the requirements of this regulatory environment. The regulations, standards, and policies of these regulatory agencies are subject to frequent change. 
We cannot predict the actions that the Administration, Congress, accreditors, or states may take or their effect on Strayer University, Capella University, or the Company. Among other things, Congress may reauthorize the Higher Education Act and adopt, repeal or amend other legislation affecting higher education institutions. Congress or the Administration may also delay, block, modify, or eliminate certain Title IV and other regulations applicable to higher education institutions, or the Administration or states may promulgate new regulations via a negotiated rulemaking process, or otherwise. In addition, the Administration may interpret, apply, and enforce Title IV and other regulations in a manner different from past guidance and practice.
U.S. Department of Education
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University and Capella University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. An institution must, among other things, be authorized to offer its educational programs by each state in which it maintains physical presence, as defined by the state, and maintain institutional accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency, as discussed below. The institution also must be certified by the Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs and follow Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under Title IV programs. For purposes of Title IV programs, Strayer University and all of its campuses are considered a single institution of higher education, such that Department of Education requirements applicable to an institution of higher education are generally applied to all of Strayer University’s campuses in the aggregate rather than on an individual basis. Capella University is also considered to be a single institution of higher education. On December 13, 2021, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University’s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through September 30, 2025. As a result of the August 1, 2018 merger, Capella University experienced a change of ownership, with the Company as its new owner. On January 18, 2019, consistent with standard procedure upon a Title IV institution’s change of ownership, the Department and Capella University executed a new Provisional Program Participation Agreement, approving Capella’s continued participation in Title IV programs with provisional certification through December 31, 2022.
U.S. Accreditation
Accreditation is a system for recognizing educational institutions and programs for integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability, and financial stability that signifies that they merit the confidence of the educational community and the public. In the United States, this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations of institutions and programs of higher education. These associations establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs, and publicly designate those institutions and programs that meet their standards. Accredited institutions or programs are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to determine whether such institutions or programs continue to maintain the performance, integrity, and quality required for accreditation. If an institution’s or program’s performance does not meet its accrediting agency’s (or possibly other regulators') expectations or applicable standards, then its operations may be conditioned or severely constrained, or the institution’s accreditation may be withdrawn, depending on the severity of the noncompliance.
Accreditation is an important attribute of Strayer University and Capella University. Colleges and universities depend on accreditation to evaluate transferability of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers sometimes rely on the accreditation status of institutions when evaluating a candidate’s credentials or considering tuition reimbursement programs. Students rely on accreditation status for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.
In order for institutions to be eligible to participate in federal student financial assistance programs, they must be accredited by an institutional accreditor recognized by the Secretary of Education. On November 1, 2019, after a negotiated rulemaking and public comment process, the Department of Education amended its regulations governing the recognition of accrediting agencies, effective July 1, 2020 (the “State Authorization and Accreditation final rule”). The final regulations revise in some respects the Department’s process for recognition and review of accrediting agencies, the criteria used by the Department to recognize accrediting agencies, and the Department’s requirements for accrediting agencies in terms of their oversight of accredited institutions and programs. These and other changes may affect the accrediting agencies’ treatment of the institutions under their jurisdiction.
For example, the rule allows accreditors to have alternative standards, policies, and procedures in the interest of innovation or to address undue hardship to students, provided certain criteria are met. The rule also repeals the strict geographic scope of institutional accreditors. Under prior practice, various accrediting agencies adopted a Policy Statement on Evaluation of Institutions Operating Interregionally (first developed in 2000), which provided that an institution’s “home” regional accreditor and the “host” regional accreditor would cooperate to evaluate an institution that delivers education at a physical site in the host accreditor’s region. Now, this policy statement is, for the most part, moot. However, different institutional accreditors have treated the policy statement differently. Capella’s institutional accreditor, HLC, has continued to demonstrate deference to the policy statement while Strayer’s institutional accreditor, Middle States, has withdrawn the corresponding internal policy.
The Higher Education Act charges the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (“NACIQI”) with recommending to the Secretary of Education which accrediting or state approval agencies should be recognized as reliable authorities for judging the quality of post-secondary institutions and programs. NACIQI reviewed the Middle States Commission at its February 2018 meeting and recommended that the Secretary of Education extend its recognition for five years. NACIQI also reviewed the Higher Learning Commission at its February 2018 meeting and recommended that the Secretary of Education extend its recognition for five years. The Secretary subsequently accepted NACIQI’s recommendation and extended the accreditors’ recognition. If an institutional accreditor loses recognition by the Secretary of Education, an institution may be allowed to continue its participation in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period not to exceed 18 months to allow the institution to seek accreditation from another recognized accrediting agency. An institution that does not become accredited by another recognized accreditor within 18 months will lose Title IV eligibility.
Strayer University
Strayer University has been institutionally accredited since 1981 by Middle States, an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Middle States accredits degree-granting public and private colleges and universities in its region (including Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), including distance education programs offered by those institutions. As a result of the State Authorization and Accreditation final rules, Middle States may also conduct accrediting activities in any other geographic region within or outside of the United States without regard to its specified region. Middle States is the same accrediting agency that accredits such universities as Georgetown University, Columbia University, the University of Maryland, and other degree-granting public and private colleges and universities.
Strayer University went through a period of reaffirmation of accreditation that began in 2015 and lasted through June 2017, when Middle States reaffirmed Strayer University’s accreditation. The University’s period of accreditation by Middle States extends into 2025. 
In 2016, Middle States provided that reaccreditation for all of its institutions will be for a period of eight years (rather than ten, as previously was the case) and that institutions will be required to submit annual reports on student achievement and financial sustainability. In accordance with Middle States’ accreditation standards, every accredited institution will undergo a periodic review at the mid-point between its eight-year evaluations.
All of Strayer University’s substantive changes require prior Middle States approval. Such changes include, but are not limited to, educational programs at different levels or different subject areas, certain contractual arrangements with other institutions providing a portion of an educational program, establishment or closure of additional locations and branch campuses, and changes in ownership or control.
In addition to institutional accreditation, Strayer University has obtained specialized or programmatic accreditation, or professional recognition, from the following organizations for specific programs: the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (“ACBSP”), the Society for Human Resource Management (“SHRM”), and the National Security Agency’s Committee on National Security Systems.
Capella University
Capella University has been institutionally accredited since 1997 by the Higher Learning Commission, a higher education institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education that accredits degree-granting public and private colleges and universities in its region (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming). As a result of the State Authorization and Accreditation final rules, the Higher Learning Commission may also conduct accrediting activities in any other geographic region within or outside of the United States without regard to its specified region. The Higher Learning Commission is the same accrediting agency that accredits such universities as Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Minnesota and other degree-granting public and private colleges and universities in its region. 
In January 2015, Capella University’s accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission was reaffirmed. The reaffirmation enables Capella University to continue to participate in Title IV programs. The next reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled to take place in 2022-2023.
The Higher Learning Commission is continuously developing new standards and approval processes under which it evaluates programs and institutions. Consistent with that approach, the Higher Learning Commission's current policies include giving the Commission more discretion to designate institutions to be in "financial distress” or under "government investigation.” Receipt of these designations could affect future accreditation status and eligibility for Title IV aid under the Department of Education’s “financial responsibility” triggers. While the Company believes its strong reputation and compliance record will continue to place Capella University in favorable standing, there is sufficient breadth and discretion within the policy that government investigation, litigation, or financial or other circumstances could result in an impact to our business from the application of the policies. In addition, the Higher Learning Commission enacted policy changes, effective September 2019, that mandate certain recruitment, admissions and related institutional practices. 
In addition to institutional accreditation, Capella University has obtained specialized or programmatic accreditation, or professional recognition, for specific programs including from the following organizations: The Association for Behavior Analysis International; Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; ACBSP; Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Programs; Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation; Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education; Council on Social Work Education; the National Security Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Project Management Institute - Global Accreditation Center for Project Management; and SHRM. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing, and Doctor of Nursing Practice degree programs at Capella University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.
Shared-Services Agreements
Strategic Education, Inc. has entered into shared-services agreements with both Strayer University and Capella University to provide certain services, including but not limited to finance, legal, human resources, information technology, financial aid, and marketing. The services are governed by Master Services Agreements, which provide, among other things, for oversight of the services by the governing board of each University. The Company continues to look for additional opportunities to provide shared services to the two universities, and believes that the agreements meet all regulatory and accreditation standards.
U.S. State Education Licensure
Licensure of Physical Campuses
The Higher Education Act and certain state laws require Strayer University and Capella University to be legally authorized to provide educational programs in the states in which the universities are physically located or otherwise have a physical presence as defined by the state. Strayer University is authorized to offer programs by the applicable educational regulatory agencies in all states where Strayer’s physical campuses are located. Strayer University is dependent upon the authorization of each state where Strayer is physically located to allow the University to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates to students in those states. Strayer University is subject to extensive regulation in each jurisdiction in which campuses are located, including in 2021: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
Capella University is registered as a private institution with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to Minnesota Statute sections 136A.61-131A.71, as required for most post-secondary private institutions that grant degrees at the associate level or above in Minnesota, and as required by the Higher Education Act to participate in Title IV programs. In 2021, Capella University was also authorized to operate in Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee.
Strayer University and Capella University will be subject to similar extensive regulation in those additional states in which we may physically expand our operations in the future. State laws and regulations affect our operations and may limit our ability to introduce new and existing educational programs or establish new campuses.
On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education adopted regulations, effective July 1, 2011, that set requirements on states for their authorization of schools for purposes of Title IV eligibility. We believe that every state above in which Strayer University and Capella University are authorized has processes in place that comply with these requirements.
In the fall of 2019, Devmountain merged into Strayer University. In the summer of 2021, Hackbright Academy merged into Strayer University.
Licensure of Online Programs
The increasing popularity and use of the internet and other technology for the delivery of education has led, and may continue to lead, to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries or to the interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to such services. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as the requirement that online education institutions be licensed as a school in one or more jurisdictions even where they have no physical location. New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase the Universities’ cost of doing business, affect the Universities’ ability to increase enrollments and revenues, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.
Various regulations regarding state authorization of distance education have been issued in recent years. On December 19, 2016, the Department issued final regulations addressing state authorization of distance education, which became effective on May 26, 2019. These regulations included, among other things, the requirement that an institution offering Title IV-eligible distance education or correspondence courses be authorized by each state in which enrolled students reside, if such authorization is required by the state. Institutions could obtain such authorization directly from the state or (except in California) through a state authorization reciprocity agreement. The regulations defined a state authorization reciprocity agreement as an agreement between two or more states that authorizes an institution located and legally authorized in a state covered by the agreement to provide post-secondary education through distance education or correspondence courses to students in other states covered by the agreement and does not prohibit a participating state from enforcing its own laws with respect to higher education. The regulations also required institutions to document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses for each state in which such students reside.
In addition, the regulations required an institution to provide public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education or correspondence courses. The public disclosures would include state authorization for the program or course, the process for submitting complaints to relevant states, any adverse actions by a state or accrediting agency related to the distance education program or correspondence course within the past five years, refund policies specific to the state, and applicable licensure or certification requirements for a career that the program prepares a student to enter. An institution was required to disclose directly to all prospective students if a distance education or correspondence course did not meet the licensure or certification requirements for a state. An institution was also required to disclose to each current and prospective student when an adverse action was taken against a distance education or correspondence program and any determination that a program ceased to meet licensure or certification requirements.
If an institution’s distance education program was found not to be in compliance with the regulations, the institution could lose its ability to award Title IV funds for that distance education program.
On November 1, 2019, the Department released final regulations on accreditation and state authorization of distance education, which became effective July 1, 2020. The rules maintain the requirement from the 2016 rule that institutions offering post-secondary education through distance education or correspondence courses to students located in a state in which the institution is not located meet state requirements in that state or participate in a state authorization reciprocity agreement. In addition, an institution must make disclosures readily available to enrolled and prospective students regarding whether programs leading to professional licensure or certification meet state educational requirements. An institution must also provide a direct disclosure to students in writing if the program leading to professional licensure or certification does not meet state educational requirements in the state in which the student is located, or if the institution has not determined whether the program meets such requirements for a given state. Whereas the disclosure requirements in the 2016 rule apply only to distance education programs, the disclosure requirements in the 2019 rule apply to both campus-based and online programs.
On August 24, 2020, the Department released final regulations on distance education and innovation. The rules granted institutions more flexibility to offer distance education and competency-based education direct assessment programs. 
Additionally, the rules created new definitions for certain terms including “academic engagement” and “regular and substantive interaction” to provide more clarity regarding Title IV requirements for distance education programs. The final rule became effective July 1, 2021, with the option for early implementation. Both Strayer University and Capella University opted to early implement the final rules in December 2020.
Beginning July 1, 2017, California required out-of-state private post-secondary educational institutions that offer distance education to California residents to register with the state's Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (“BPPE”). Strayer University and Capella University have filed BPPE registration applications and received confirmation of the registration.
State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement
Varying state regulations, fees, and paperwork embedded in the many different state approaches to regulation of post-secondary institutions have historically limited the ability to grow across state lines to offer students high-quality choices for education and have hindered national workforce initiatives. As a solution to the ever-growing complexity of the regulatory oversight of institutions of higher learning on a state-by-state basis, the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”) has emerged to aid in the advancement of distance education.
SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by post-secondary institutions based in another state, while also facilitating more effective and efficient oversight and monitoring processes nationally for the benefit of states and institutions. On March 6, 2015 and December 2, 2016, respectively, Capella and Strayer Universities became participants in SARA. As participants in SARA, the Universities may offer online courses and other forms of distance education to students in any participating SARA state in which the Universities do not have a physical location or a physical presence as defined by the state without having to seek any new state institutional approval beyond their home states (Minnesota and Washington, D.C., respectively). The Universities’ home states, in turn, will continually monitor the institutions’ compliance with SARA standards. With this initiative, the Universities are able to expand distance education offerings with increased consistency and ease. The only state that does not now participate in SARA is California.
The reciprocity agreement does not affect university operations that constitute a physical presence in a particular state, and the Universities will continue to follow individual state regulations for on-ground campuses and activities. At this time, SARA does not deal with professional licensing board approval for programs leading to state licensing in fields such as nursing, teacher education, psychology, and the like, and the Universities must seek such approvals on a state-by-state basis, as needed.
State Professional Licensure
States have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Capella University graduates often seek to obtain professional licensure in their chosen fields following graduation because it will enhance employment opportunities or they are legally required to do so for employment purposes. Their success in obtaining licensure depends on several factors, including each individual’s personal and professional qualifications as well as other factors related to the degree or program completed, such as:
•Whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association;
•Whether the program from which the student graduated and the curriculum completed meets all state requirements; and
•Whether the institution and/or the specific program is accredited.
Professional licensure requirements vary by state and may change over time. Capella University has a team dedicated to professional licensure that works directly with students. The licensure team develops and maintains extensive resources to inform students of unique state licensing requirements prior to enrollment and throughout their program, including delivering direct disclosures to students in licensure-track programs as required by the U.S. Department of Education. The University’s catalog and websites also describe the requirements for obtaining professional licensure, paired with specific disclaimers that reiterate student responsibility for licensure outcomes.
Capella’s licensure team works directly with licensing authorities to try to resolve barriers to licensure for its alumni. The team also assists alumni with exploring alternative options to achieve licensure, including completing additional coursework at Capella or at another institution.
Capella University makes no representation, warranty or guarantee that successful completion of the course of study will result in the student obtaining the necessary licensure or certification. Compliance with state or professional licensure or certification requirements is the student’s sole responsibility.
Other U.S. Approvals
Strayer University and Capella University are approved by appropriate authorities for the education of active duty military personnel and qualifying family members, veterans and members of the selected reserve and their spouses and dependents, as well as for the rehabilitation of veterans. In addition, Strayer University is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. Strayer University is also authorized to participate in state financial aid programs in Pennsylvania, Florida, Alabama, and Vermont. Capella University is authorized to participate in the Minnesota GI Bill and the Minnesota Indian Scholarship programs.
Financing Student Education
Students finance their education at Strayer University and Capella University in a variety of ways, and historically about 75% of students participated in one or more Title IV programs. Many financial aid programs are designed to assist eligible students whose financial resources are inadequate to meet the cost of education. With these programs, financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the cost of attending a program of study and the amount a student reasonably can be expected to contribute to those expenses. All recipients of federal student financial aid must maintain a satisfactory grade point average (“GPA”) and progress in a timely manner toward completion of a program of study.
In addition, many of our working adult students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Congress has enacted several tax credits for students pursuing higher education and has provided for a tax deduction for interest on student loans and exclusions from income of certain tuition reimbursement amounts. Eligible students at Strayer University or Capella University may participate in educational assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) (and related state agencies), the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), and various private organizations. Eligible students at Strayer University may also participate in educational assistance programs administered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of Florida, and the State of Vermont. Some Capella University students may qualify to participate in the Minnesota GI Bill program or the Minnesota Indian Scholarship program.
Under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (as amended), sometimes referred to as the “New GI Bill,” eligible veterans may receive, among other benefits, tuition benefits up to the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance), subject to a cap of $26,043 for non-public domestic institutions for 2021-2022. In addition, eligible students pursuing an educational program solely through distance learning are eligible to receive a housing stipend of approximately $871 per month, half the amount available to students attending certain classroom-based programs or programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning.
On August 16, 2017, the President signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, commonly known as the “Forever GI Bill”. The law makes several changes to the administration of VA education benefits. Among other things, for service members who left the military after January 1, 2013, the bill removes the requirement that they use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits within 15 years after their last 90-day period of active-duty service. The bill also alters the way the VA calculates eligibility for VA education benefits by providing additional benefits to service members with at least 90 days but less than six months of active-duty service. Additionally, the bill will restore VA education benefits to students who were enrolled in schools that closed after January 2015 if their credits did not transfer.
On January 5, 2021, former President Trump signed into law the Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, which expands student veterans’ protections. Among other things, the legislation requires a risk-based review of schools if an institution is operating under Heightened Cash Monitoring 2, under provisional approval status by the Department of Education, subject to any punitive action by a federal or state entity, facing the loss or risk of loss of accreditation, or has converted from for-profit to non-profit status. The legislation also restores veterans benefits to students whose school closed, as long as the student transferred fewer than 12 credits; protects students from debt collection by the Department of Veterans Affairs for overpaid tuition benefits; and establishes a number of institutional requirements, including: providing clear disclosures about cost, loan debt, graduation and job placement rates, and acceptance of transfer credit; ensuring institutions are accommodating short absences due to service; prohibiting same-day recruitment and registration; and prohibiting more than three unsolicited recruiting contacts. In 2021, Congress also passed, and the President signed into law, two related technical corrections bills that amended certain provisions of the Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020: the Training in High-demand Roles to Improve Veteran Employment ("THRIVE") Act and the Responsible Education Mitigating Options and Technical Extensions ("REMOTE") Act. 
Strayer University and Capella University participate in DOD military tuition assistance programs under Memoranda of Understanding (“MOU”). Strayer University’s current MOU was executed on September 5, 2019. Capella University’s current MOU was executed on September 26, 2019. Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the DOD military tuition assistance programs. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, Strayer University and Capella University agree to comply with DOD rules and procedures regarding the receipt of tuition assistance on behalf of active duty military personnel (and qualifying family members) in attendance at the University.
Title IV Programs
Strayer University and Capella University maintain eligibility for their students to participate in the following Title IV programs:
•Federal Grants. Grants under the Federal Pell Grant program are available to eligible students based on financial need and other factors.
•Campus-Based Programs. The campus-based Title IV programs include the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, the Federal Perkins Loan, and the Federal Work-Study Program. Neither Strayer University nor Capella University actively participates in the Federal Perkins Loan program, which expired on September 30, 2017. In addition, Strayer University does not actively participate in the Federal Work-Study Program.
•Federal Direct Student Loans. Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Department of Education makes loans directly to students and their parents. Undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized loan. The federal government pays the interest on a subsidized loan while the student is in school and during any approved periods of deferment, after which the student’s obligation to repay the loan begins. Unsubsidized loans are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized loan or, in some cases, in addition to a subsidized loan. PLUS loans, including Graduate PLUS loans, are unsubsidized loans available in amounts up to the total cost of attendance less any other financial aid.
Federal Financial Aid Regulation
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer and Capella Universities must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. As part of those participation standards, the Department of Education determines whether, among other things, the institution meets certain standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility. The institutions must also follow extensive Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under Title IV programs. Some of the key provisions regarding institutional eligibility and processing federal financial aid are described below.
Program Participation Agreement
Each institution participating in Title IV programs must enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education. Under the agreement, the institution agrees to follow the Department’s rules and regulations governing Title IV programs. On December 13, 2021, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University’s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through September 30, 2025. On January 18, 2019, consistent with standard procedure upon a Title IV institution’s change of ownership, the Department and Capella University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Capella University’s continued participation in Title IV programs with provisional certification through December 31, 2022.
Provisional Certification
In certain circumstances, the Department of Education may certify an institution’s continuing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for up to three complete award years (July 1 – June 30) from the date of provisional certification. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement, which typically require approval by the Department of Education for establishment of an additional location, increase in the level of academic offering, and addition of any educational program (including degree, non-degree, or short-term training programs) before awarding or disbursing Title IV aid to students enrolled at such a location or in such a program. If the Department of Education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may revoke or further condition the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Should the Department of Education revoke eligibility during the provisional period, the institution may request reconsideration, and the Secretary of Education’s decision whether or not revocation is warranted constitutes final agency action. Strayer University is 
operating under full certification. Consistent with standard procedure following a change of control, Capella University is operating under provisional certification with no conditions other than the customary conditions described above. The Department of Education is currently in the process of developing new regulations regarding, among other things, requirements of institutions that are provisionally certified as part of the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
Administrative Capability
Department of Education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution, among other things, must: (1) comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; (2) have cohort default rates below specified levels; (3) have acceptable methods for defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; (4) have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; (5) not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; (6) submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and (7) not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. 
If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or any other Department of Education regulation, the Department of Education may:
•Require the repayment of Title IV funds;
•Transfer the institution from the Department of Education’s advance system of receiving Title IV program funds to a cash monitoring or reimbursement system, under which an institution must disburse its own funds to students and document the students’ eligibility for Title IV program funds before receiving such funds from the Department of Education;
•Place the institution on provisional certification status; or
•Commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.
The Department of Education is currently in the process of promulgating new regulations regarding, among other things, administrative capability criteria as part of the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
Financial Responsibility
The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Strayer and Capella Universities must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to the Department of Education for debts and liabilities incurred in programs administered by the Department of Education.
Department of Education standards utilize a complex formula to assess financial responsibility. The standards focus on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s financial viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit or within its means). An institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without alternative measures and further federal oversight. For Strayer University and Capella University, the Department evaluates financial responsibility at the parent level, based on review of SEI’s financial statements. We have applied the financial responsibility standards to our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and based on our calculated composite score and other relevant factors, we believe we meet the Department of Education’s financial responsibility standards. 
On November 1, 2016, the Department of Education released a new regulation, which after a series of delays became effective as of October 16, 2018, under which an institution may no longer be considered financially responsible if one or more of a list of “triggering events” occurs. The Department of Education will automatically determine that an institution is not financially responsible if, among other things, the institution receives certain warnings from the SEC, fails to file required reports in a timely manner, or has a cohort default rate of 30% or greater for each of the two most recent official calculations. The Department of Education will also determine that an institution is not financially responsible if certain triggering events, such as a lawsuit against the institution, an accrediting agency’s requirement that the institution submit a teach-out plan, or 
potential loss of Title IV eligibility for gainful employment programs, result in the institution’s recalculated composite score to be less than 1.0. The Department of Education may also invoke certain “discretionary” triggering events, such as citation by a state agency or accrediting agency for failure to satisfy the agency’s standards, to determine that an institution is not financially responsible. An institution determined not to be financially responsible because of one or more triggering events may be required to issue an irrevocable letter of credit for not less than 10% of the Title IV funds received by the school for the most recently completed fiscal year and/or will be issued a Provisional Program Participation Agreement. 
On August 30, 2019, as part of the final Borrower Defense to Repayment (“BDTR”) regulations, the Department of Education made changes to the financial responsibility requirements, including establishing a more limited set, as compared to the 2016 rule, of mandatory and discretionary triggering events that have, or could have, a materially adverse impact on the institution’s financial condition and therefore warrant financial protection. The 2019 rule left intact the consequences of the triggering events under the 2016 rule. The 2019 rule further updates the definitions of terms used to calculate an institution’s composite score and otherwise amends the composite score methodology to reflect changes in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) accounting standards pertaining to new leases. The financial responsibility changes became effective July 1, 2020.
The Department of Education is currently in the process of promulgating new regulations regarding, among other things, financial responsibility as part of the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
Student Loan Defaults
The Department of Education calculates a rate of student defaults (known as a cohort default rate) for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year. The Department of Education includes in the cohort all student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct or Federal Family Education Loan Program loan during that fiscal year. The cohort default rate is the percentage of those borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year and default by the end of the second federal fiscal year following that fiscal year, resulting in a three-year cohort default rate. Because of the need to collect data on defaults, the Department of Education publishes cohort default rates three years in arrears; for example, in the fall of 2021, the Department of Education issued cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2018.
The Department of Education may take adverse action against an institution if it has excessive cohort default rates, including the following:
•If an institution’s cohort default rate is 30% or more in a given fiscal year, the institution will be required to assemble a “default prevention task force” and submit to the Department of Education a default improvement plan.
•If an institution’s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two consecutive years, the institution will be required to review, revise, and resubmit its default improvement plan.
•If an institution’s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two out of three consecutive years, the Department of Education may subject the institution to provisional certification.
•If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which data are available, the institution will be ineligible to participate in the Direct Loan Program and Federal Pell Grant Program.
An institution generally loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its most recent cohort default rate is greater than 40%. Institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 15% for any of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available are subject to a 30-day delayed disbursement period for first-year, first-time undergraduate borrowers.
Strayer University and Capella University’s official three-year cohort default rates for 2016, 2017, and 2018, as well as the average official three-year cohort default rates for proprietary institutions nationally, were as follows:

 | Strayer University | | Capella University | | National AverageProprietary Institutions
2016 | 10.4 | % | | 6.8 | % | 15.2 | %
2017 | 11.3 | % | | 6.5 | % | 14.7 | %
2018 | 8.6 | % | | 5.2 | % | 11.2 | %

As part of the compliance programs related to the cohort default rate, Strayer University and Capella University provide entrance and exit counseling to their students and engage the services of third parties to counsel students once they are in repayment status regarding their repayment obligations.
On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which included a provision that established a federal student loan administrative forbearance period, pause in interest accrual, and suspension of collections activity through September 30, 2020. Former Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos extended these student loan flexibilities through January 31, 2021. President Biden subsequently extended the period through May 1, 2022. While it is too early to know the entirety of the impact that COVID and COVID-related repayment flexibility will have on the cohort default rate, the Company expects that the next one or more cohort years will be affected.
The 90/10 Rule
A requirement of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education, which include Strayer University and Capella University. Under this rule, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenues (as revenues are computed under the Department of Education’s methodology) from Title IV funds on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year.
A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for up to two fiscal years. Proprietary institutions of higher education that violate the 90/10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years will become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and will be required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. In addition, the Department of Education discloses on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the 90/10 requirement, and reports annually to Congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education.
Using the statutory formula, Strayer University derived approximately 82.95% of its cash-basis revenues from Title IV program funds in 2020. Capella University derived approximately 71.98% of its cash-basis revenues from Title IV program funds in 2020. Our computation for 2021 has not yet been finalized and audited; however, we believe we will remain in compliance with the 90/10 Rule requirement.
The key components of non-Title IV revenue for Strayer University and Capella University are individual student payments, employer tuition reimbursement payments, veterans’ education benefits, military tuition assistance, vocational rehabilitation funds, private loans, state grants, and scholarships.
On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included a change to the 90/10 methodology to include all federal funding. Under the legislation, these revisions to the 90/10 Rule would apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The Department of Education is currently in the process of promulgating new regulations regarding, among other things, the 90/10 rule as part of the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
In addition, certain members of Congress have proposed to revise the 90/10 Rule to reduce the limit on federal funding to 85% of total revenue. In the context of Higher Education Act reauthorization, defense bills and appropriations bills, other members of Congress have proposed legislation that would eliminate the 90/10 Rule. We cannot predict whether or how legislative or regulatory changes will affect the 90/10 Rule.
Restrictions on Incentive Compensation
As a part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the Department of Education and in accordance with the Higher Education Act and Title IV regulations, the institution may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or awarding financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid-awarding activity. The rule applies to all institutional employees and service providers who are engaged in or responsible for any student recruitment or admission activity or making decisions regarding the award of financial aid. The Department of Education has interpreted the regulation not to apply to employees who are involved only in the development of policy and do not engage in individual student contact. Merit-based adjustments to covered employees' compensation may be made if they are not based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid.
Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in loss of certification to participate in federal student financial aid programs, limitations on participation in the federal student financial aid programs, False Claims Act litigation, or financial penalties. In June 2015, the Department of Education announced in a memorandum that it would revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the incentive payment prohibition. The memorandum stated that the Department of Education would calculate the amount of institutional liability based on the cost to the Department of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to the Department of all Title IV funds received by the institution over a period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment prohibition. We believe we are in compliance with the regulation.
Gainful Employment
Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts (for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations related to gainful employment. The regulation went into effect on July 1, 2015 (“2015 Regulations”), with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which generally went into effect January 1, 2017, although some portions of those requirements were delayed until July 1, 2019. 
The 2015 Regulations included two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual income rate measured student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measured student debt in relation to discretionary income. A program passed if the program’s graduates:
•have an annual income rate ratio that does not exceed 8%; or
•have a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.
In addition, a program that did not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics and had an annual income rate between 8% and 12% or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30% was considered to be in a warning zone. A program failed if the program’s graduates had an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program became Title IV-ineligible for three years if it failed both metrics for two out of three consecutive years or failed to pass at least one metric for four consecutive award years. 
On January 8, 2017, Strayer and Capella Universities received their final 2015 debt-to-earnings measures. None of their programs failed the debt-to-earnings metrics. Two active Strayer University programs, the Associate in Arts in Accounting and Associate in Arts in Business Administration, were “in the zone,” and one active Capella University program, the Masters of Science in Marriage and Family Counseling/Therapy, was “in the zone.” Each of those three programs remained fully eligible. The Department has not yet released any subsequent debt-to-earnings measures.
On July 1, 2019, the Department of Education released final gainful employment regulations, which contain a full repeal of the 2015 Regulations, including all debt measures, reporting, disclosure, and certification requirements, effective July 1, 2020.
On December 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for, among other topics, gainful employment, via the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility rulemaking. Meetings of the negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
Return of Federal Funds
Under the Higher Education Act’s return-of-funds provision, an institution must return Title IV funds to a Title IV program in a timely manner if a student received funds from that program, but did not earn them due to the student’s withdrawal from the institution. In order to determine if funds should be returned, the institution must first determine the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned. If the student attends the institution, but withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% point, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. Strayer University and Capella University are required to measure the last day of attendance based on official attendance records, and “attendance” for online classes must include participation in an academically-related activity. Strayer University's and Capella University's systems allow for measurement on this basis. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of the unearned Title IV program funds or the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date that the institution determines that a student withdrew.
If the Title IV funds are not returned in a timely manner, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit an irrevocable letter of credit equal to 25% of the funds the institution should have returned in its most recently completed fiscal year. If late returns of Title IV program funds constitute 5% or more of students sampled in the institution’s annual compliance audit for either of its two most recently completed fiscal years, an institution generally must submit such a letter of credit payable to the Secretary of Education.
Misrepresentation
Under the Higher Education Act, the Department of Education may impose various sanctions, including a fine or suspension or termination of an institution’s participation in Title IV programs, if it engages in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Department’s related regulations, which took effect July 1, 2011, set forth the types of activities that constitute misrepresentation and describe the adverse actions that the Department of Education may take if it finds that an institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution engaged in substantial misrepresentation. The rule specifies the types of statements that can subject the institution to liability for misrepresentation, as well as the nature and form of misleading statements. 
As part of the Department’s 2016 promulgation of the Borrower Defenses to Repayment regulation, the Department changed the definition of misrepresentation for Title IV regulations to include any statement that “has the likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances.” The expanded definition included “any statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading.” This regulation was published on November 1, 2016 and, after a series of delays, went into effect as of October 16, 2018. 
On August 30, 2019, the Department released final Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations that included a new definition of “misrepresentation,” which became effective July 1, 2020. The final rule defines a “misrepresentation” as: a statement, act, or omission by an eligible school to a borrower (a) that is false, misleading, or deceptive, (b) that was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth, and (c) that directly and clearly relates to either (1) enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution, or (2) the provision of educational services for which the loan was made.
On August 10, 2021 the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations on, among other things, Borrower Defense to Repayment, including a new definition of misrepresentation. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings completed in December 2021 with no consensus reached on the topic. As a result, the Department of Education has discretion to propose a new rule for public comment.
Borrower Defenses to Repayment
Pursuant to the Higher Education Act and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, the Department of Education released a final regulation specifying the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the Secretary of Education (the “2016 BDTR Rule”). Under the 2016 BDTR Rule, for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, a student borrower may assert a defense to repayment if: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a “substantial misrepresentation” on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment.
These defenses are asserted through claims submitted to the Department of Education, and the Department has the authority to issue a final decision. In addition, the regulation permits the Department to grant relief to an individual or group of individuals, including individuals who have not applied to the Department seeking relief. If a defense is successfully raised, the Department has discretion to initiate action to collect from an institution the amount of losses incurred based on the borrower defense. The 2016 BDTR Rule also amends the rules concerning discharge of federal student loans when a school or campus closes and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers for borrower defense-type claims. On January 19, 2017, the Department of Education issued a final rule, updating the hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution of higher education and establishing procedures for recovery proceedings under the borrower defense regulations. Several times between June 2017 and February 2018, the Department of Education announced delays until July 1, 2019 of implementation of certain portions of the 2016 BDTR Rule, including those portions of the regulations that establish a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a Direct Loan borrower has a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan based on an act or omission of an institution. However, in October 2018, a judge denied a request to delay implementation of portions of the regulations, and as a result the 2016 BDTR Rule went into effect as of October 16, 2018.
On September 23, 2019, the Department published final Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations (the “2019 BDTR Rule”), which governs borrower defense to repayment claims in connection with loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. Under the 2019 BDTR Rule, an individual borrower can assert a defense to repayment and be eligible for relief if she or he establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the institution at which the borrower enrolled made a misrepresentation of material fact upon which the borrower reasonably relied in deciding to obtain a Direct Loan or a loan repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan; (2) the misrepresentation directly and clearly related to the borrower’s enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or the institution’s provision of education services for which the loan was made; and (3) the borrower was financially harmed by the misrepresentation. The Department will grant forbearance on all loans related to a claim at the time the claim is made.
The 2019 BDTR Rule defines “financial harm” as the amount of monetary loss that a borrower incurs as a consequence of a misrepresentation. The Department will determine financial harm based upon individual earnings and circumstances, which must include consideration of the individual borrower’s career experience subsequent to enrollment and may include, among other factors, evidence of program-level median or mean earnings. “Financial harm” does not include damages for nonmonetary loss, and the act of taking out a Direct Loan, alone, does not constitute evidence of financial harm. Financial harm also cannot be predominantly due to intervening local, regional, national economic or labor market conditions, nor can it arise from the borrower’s voluntary change in occupation or decision to pursue less than full-time work or decision not to work. The 2019 BDTR Rule contains certain limitations and procedural protections. Among the most prominent of these restrictions, the regulation contains a three-year limitation period of claims, measured from the student’s separation from the institution, does not permit claims to be filed on behalf of groups, and requires that institutions receive access to any evidence in the Department’s possession to inform its response. The 2019 BDTR Rule permits the usage of pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of enrollment, so long as the institution provides plain-language disclosures to students and the disclosure is placed on the institution’s website. The regulations also allow for a borrower to choose whether to apply for a closed school loan discharge or accept a teach-out opportunity. In addition, the closed school discharge window is expanded from 120 days to 180 days prior to the school’s closure, though the final rule does not allow for an automatic closed school loan discharge.
Institutions are required to accept responsibility for the repayment of amounts discharged by the Secretary pursuant to the borrower defense to repayment, closed school discharge, false certification discharge, and unpaid refund discharge regulations. If the Secretary discharges a loan in whole or in part, the Department of Education may require the school to repay the amount of the discharged loan.
On August 10, 2021 the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations on, among other things, Borrower Defense to Repayment. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings completed in December 2021 with no consensus reached on the topic. As a result, the Department of Education has discretion to propose a new rule for public comment.
Third-Party Servicers
Department of Education regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution’s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to the Department of Education new contracts or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. Strayer University and Capella University have written contracts with third-party servicers to perform activities related to Strayer University’s and Capella University’s participation in Title IV programs. Strayer University also has a contract with Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. for processing stipends due to students. For loan default prevention, Strayer University and Capella University contract with Student Connections. Strayer University and Capella University also contract with the National Student Clearinghouse to report enrollment status updates to the National Student Loan Data System. Strayer University and Capella University believe that their third-party servicer contracts comply with the regulations, and they have reported such contracts to the Department of Education.
Lender Relationships
As part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the Department of Education, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans. Strayer University and Capella University have a code of conduct that we believe complies with the provisions of the Higher Education Act in all material respects. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, the Higher Education Act contains provisions that apply to lenders, prohibiting lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions.
Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
State requirements and accrediting agency standards can limit, slow, or halt the ability of Strayer University and Capella University to establish legally authorized additional locations and programs. Most states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. Middle States requires its accredited institutions to notify it in advance of implementing new programs or additional locations as defined by Middle States, which may require additional approval. At its discretion, Middle States may also conduct site visits to additional locations to evaluate whether accredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of additional locations, among other reasons, maintain educational quality. All new Strayer University locations require Middle States approval before students are enrolled, and the Higher Education Act requires Middle States to monitor institutions with significant enrollment growth. The Higher Learning Commission, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, and other state educational regulatory agencies that license or authorize Capella University and its degree programs require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs and, upon notification, may undertake a review of the institution’s licensure, authorization or accreditation.
The Higher Education Act requires proprietary institutions of higher education to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, the applicable regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. These additional locations generally may qualify immediately for participation in Title IV programs, unless the location was acquired from another institution that has ceased offering educational programs at that location and has Title IV liabilities that it is not repaying in accordance with an agreement to do so, and the acquiring institution does not agree, among other matters, to be responsible for certain liabilities of the acquired institution. The new location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval of the additional location by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency. Any Strayer University or Capella University expansion plans assume its continued ability to establish new campuses as additional locations under such applicable regulations and thereby avoid incurring the two-year delay in participation in Title IV programs. 
Department of Education regulations require institutions to report to the Department of Education a new additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program may be offered, if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Under its Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education, Strayer University must notify the Department of Education of the addition of any such location within ten days of opening, but need not seek prior approval. Under Capella University’s provisional certification, the Department of Education must approve any new campus locations, level of academic offerings, and non-degree and degree programs before Capella University may award or disburse Title IV aid to students enrolled at any such location or in any such program. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions. The loss of state authorization or accreditation of a university or an existing campus, or the failure of a university or a new campus to obtain state authorization or accreditation, would render the university ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, at least in that state or at that location. 
Credit Hours
The Higher Education Act and regulations use the term “credit hour” to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV program funds an institution may disburse during a payment period. The regulations define the term “credit hour” and require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution’s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by the Department of Education could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution’s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If the Department of Education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the Department of Education could impose liabilities or other sanctions. We believe that both Strayer University and Capella University are in compliance with the credit hour rules.
In addition to the credit hour model, the Department of Education has granted approvals for a small number of institutions to operate direct assessment academic programs. Instead of measuring student progress through the number of credit hours spent in the course, these direct assessment programs allow students to progress through courses by showing mastery over material through the completion of assessments. These programs sometimes allow students to finish courses in less time than it would take to complete a course under a credit hour model. The Department of Education approved Capella University to operate direct assessment courses, and Capella University has been doing so under its FlexPath programs. 
COVID-19 Related Legislation and Administrative Actions
On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes provisions that provide relief to students and to the institutions of higher education that they attend. This legislation granted the Department of Education regulatory flexibility in waiving some requirements established under the Higher Education Act related to the administration of federal student aid programs. For example, the CARES Act modified the process that institutions must follow for the return of unearned Title IV funds in connection with student withdrawals and provided institutions with additional flexibility for the measurement of satisfactory academic progress for students. The CARES Act suspended payments and interest accrual for Federal Family Education Loans and Direct Loans until September 30, 2020. Subsequent executive action by the previous and current administrations have extended these suspensions until May 1, 2022. The Department issued several guidance documents outlining and interpreting these changes. Additionally, the CARES Act established a $12.6 billion Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (“HEERF”). While the Department allocated CARES Act HEERF funding for Strayer, the university did not accept its allocation. 
On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”), which included several education-related provisions. Relevant provisions of the CAA increased the maximum Pell Grant for the 2021-2022 award year, restored quarters/semesters of Pell eligibility to students who have successfully asserted a borrower defense to repayment; repealed the limitation on lifetime subsidized loan eligibility (known as “Subsidized Usage Limit Applies,” or SULA), and simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The CAA also appropriated an additional $22.7 billion for the HEERF to be distributed to higher education institutions. In January 2021, the Department released a table of institutional allocation of funds which indicated that Capella University was eligible for $328,602 and Strayer University was eligible for $5,831,606, all of which was disbursed to students with the highest need, in the form of direct grants in spring 2021.
On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARP”), which included $40 billion in emergency funding for higher education. Capella University disbursed $184,323 to students of the highest need in June 2021, and Strayer University disbursed $2,554,682 to students of the highest need in July 2021. ARP also included an adjustment to the tax code by making any student loan debt discharged through 2025 tax-free, and an adjustment to the 90/10 rule. The change includes all federal funding – not just Title IV funds – in the 90/10 calculation. ARP’s 90/10 changes require the Department to issue regulations, with an effective date no earlier than institutional fiscal years beginning January 1, 2023. On December 8, 2021 the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations on, among other things, the 90/10 rule via the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022. 
Other Regulations Governing Title IV Programs
The Department of Education has enacted a comprehensive set of regulations governing an institution’s participation in Title IV programs. If either Strayer University or Capella University were not to continue to comply with these regulations, such noncompliance might affect the operations of the University and its ability to participate in Title IV programs.
The Clery Act and Title IX
Strayer and Capella Universities must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the “Clery Act”). In addition, the Department has interpreted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination and to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure by the Universities to comply with the Clery Act or Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department fining the Universities, or limiting or suspending their participation in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, and could harm the Universities’ reputations. We believe that the Universities are in compliance with these requirements. 
On May 6, 2020, the Department of Education published final rules related to implementation of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The final rules define what constitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, describe what actions trigger an institution’s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and specify how an institution must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. Among other things, the new rules include a requirement for live hearings on Title IX sexual harassment claims, which includes direct and cross-examination of parties, university-provided advisors (in the event a student or party does not provide an advisor), rulings on questions of relevance by decision-makers, and the creation and maintenance of a record of the live hearing proceedings. The final rules became effective August 14, 2020. 
On August 24, 2021, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued guidance indicating it would cease enforcement of the rules’ prohibition against consideration of statements made by individuals failing to submit to cross-examination at a live hearing. The Department of Education has conducted public hearings concerning its Title IX regulations and expects to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment in April 2022.
Students with Disabilities
Federal agencies, including the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, have considered or are considering how electronic and information technology should be made accessible to persons with disabilities. For example, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance. The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), prohibits discrimination based on disability in several areas, including public accommodations. In 2010, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, which enforces the ADA, asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights and third parties have brought enforcement actions against institutions related to website accessibility of online course material. As a result of such enforcement action or as a result of new laws and regulations that require greater accessibility, the Department of Education or the Department of Justice may require an institution to modify its online classrooms and other uses of technology to satisfy applicable requirements. As with all nondiscrimination laws that apply to recipients of federal financial assistance, an institution may lose access to certain federal financial assistance if it does not comply with Section 504 requirements. In addition, private parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits alleging failure to comply with laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, such as Section 504 and the ADA, and seeking monetary damages and correction of the alleged violations. 
Compliance Reviews
Strayer University and Capella University are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department of Education, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, guaranty agencies, and accrediting agencies. The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations also require an institution to submit annually to the Secretary of Education a compliance audit of its administration of Title IV programs conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit guides of the Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General (“ED OIG”). For fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, Strayer University and Capella University must submit such audits that have been conducted in accordance with a guide for audits of proprietary schools that was issued by the ED OIG in September 2016. In addition, to enable the Secretary of Education to make a determination of financial responsibility, an institution must submit annually to the Secretary of Education audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Department of Education regulations. For Strayer University and Capella University, financial responsibility is determined at the SEI parent level. 
In June 2019, the Department conducted an announced, on-site program review at Capella University, focused on Capella University’s FlexPath program. The review covered the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 federal financial aid years. The Department issued its preliminary program report on November 13, 2020, and Capella University responded to the report. On February 9, 2021, Capella University received the Department’s Final Program Review Determination, which closed the Program Review without further action required on the part of Capella University.
On March 17, 2021, the Department informed Strayer University that it planned to conduct an announced, remote program review. The review commenced on April 19, 2021 and covered the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 federal student financial aid years. On September 21, 2021, Strayer University received the Department’s Final Program Review Determination, which closed the Program Review without further action required on the part of Strayer University.
On October 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced establishment of an Office of Enforcement within the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, designed to strengthen oversight over and enforcement against postsecondary schools that participate in federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. The Office of Enforcement restores an office first established by the Department in 2016. The Office of Enforcement will be comprised of four existing divisions: Administrative Actions and Appeals Services Group, Borrower Defense Group, Investigations Group, and Resolution and Referral Management Group. The Department intends the Office of Enforcement to coordinate with other state and federal partners, including the Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
If either Strayer University or Capella University fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the Department of Education could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring the University from the advance payment method to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV funds, requiring the University to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against the University, or referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate the University’s participation in Title IV programs. Although there are no such sanctions currently in force against Strayer University or Capella University, if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of that University’s participation in Title IV programs or resulted in substantial fines or monetary liabilities, that University and the Company could be materially and adversely affected.
If Strayer University or Capella University lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if Congress reduced the amount of available federal student financial aid, the University would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although the Universities believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending the Universities, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such student financial aid are unlikely to be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. The Universities may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance in a manner that complies with rules governing schools’ relationships with lenders or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of eligibility of Strayer University or Capella University to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on Strayer University or Capella University, even if it could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties.
Acquisitions of Other Institutions
When a company, partnership or any other entity or individual acquires an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV programs, that institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by the Department of Education. Upon such a change of control, an institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs is generally suspended until it has applied for recertification by the Department of Education as an eligible institution under its new ownership, which requires that the institution also re-establish its state authorization and accreditation. 
The Department of Education may also temporarily and provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change of ownership under certain circumstances while the Department of Education reviews the institution’s application. The time required for the Department of Education to act on such an application may vary substantially. The Department of Education’s recertification of an institution following a change of control will be on a provisional basis.
On December 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations for, among other topics, issues related to changes of control, via the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022.
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
Many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies. Both Strayer University’s accrediting agency, Middle States, and Capella University’s accrediting agency, the Higher Learning Commission, require institutions that they accredit to inform them in advance of any substantive change, including a change that significantly alters the ownership or control of the institution. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to, and approval by, the agency include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a proprietary institution. Both agencies must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution’s accreditation status. Additionally, both Middle States and the Higher Learning Commission will undertake a site visit to an institution that has undergone a change in ownership or control no later than six months after the change. Each state in which the institution operates may also have its own change in ownership 
approval processes. Additionally, SARA and its affiliated state portal agencies may require certain notifications or applications in relation to a change in ownership. 
Federal agencies also regulate changes in ownership and control. The Higher Education Act provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to the Department of Education in order to reestablish such eligibility. An institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period from the change of ownership and control until recertification. The Higher Education Act provides that the Department of Education may also temporarily, provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change of ownership and control based on preliminary review by the Department of Education of a materially complete application received by the Department of Education within ten business days after the transaction. The Department of Education may continue such temporary, provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application. If the Department of Education approves the application after a change in ownership and control, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. The Higher Education Act defines one of the events that would trigger a change in ownership resulting in a change of control as the transfer of the controlling interest of the stock of the institution or its parent corporation. For a publicly traded corporation such as Strategic Education, Inc., the Department of Education regulations define a change of control as occurring when a person or entity acquires ownership and control of a corporation, such that the corporation is required to file a Form 8-K with the SEC publicly disclosing the change of control. The regulations also provide that a change in ownership and control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if a person or entity who is a controlling stockholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling stockholder. A controlling stockholder is a stockholder who holds, or controls through agreement, at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other stockholder. Additionally, the Department of Education regulations require institutions to make certain notice filings with the agency should a shareholder acquire 25% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. Strayer University currently is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements (because Capella is on-line only, and foreign students must take a portion of their classes on-ground, Capella University does participate). In certain circumstances, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.
Pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists, some of the programs offered by Strayer University and Capella University are approved by state approving agencies for the enrollment of persons eligible to receive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits. In 2021, Strayer University had such approval in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. In 2021, Capella University had such approval in Minnesota, and because all of its programs are online only, this approval allows it to extend VA education benefits to students in all states and abroad. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.
If Strayer University or Capella University underwent a change of control that required approval by any state authority, accrediting agency, or any federal agency, and such approval were significantly delayed, limited, or denied, there could be a material adverse effect on the University’s ability to offer certain educational programs, award certain degrees, diplomas, or certificates, operate one or more of its locations, admit certain students, or participate in Title IV programs, which in turn, could materially and adversely affect the University’s operations. A change that required approval by a state regulatory authority, an accrediting agency, or a federal agency could also delay the University’s ability to establish new campuses or educational programs and may have other adverse regulatory effects. Furthermore, the suspension from Title IV programs and the necessity of obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with a change of control could materially limit the University’s flexibility in future financing or acquisition transactions.
Legislative and Regulatory Activity
Congress, from time to time, considers legislation that would make changes in the Higher Education Act and other education-related federal laws. The Department of Education and other federal agencies similarly consider new regulations and regulatory amendments. State legislatures and agencies and accreditors likewise periodically change their laws, regulations, and standards. Such activity may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions. Although legislative and regulatory activity in recent years has had a negative impact on the for-profit post-secondary education industry as a whole, we cannot predict the impact of recent, pending, or possible future legislative or regulatory changes, if any, on our long-term business model.
Congress
Congress historically has reauthorized the Higher Education Act approximately every five to six years. In 2008, Congress reauthorized the HEA through the end of 2013. Congress has held hearings regarding the reauthorization of the HEA and continued to consider new legislation regarding the passage thereof. It is currently unclear when Congress will reauthorize the Higher Education Act, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has further delayed these efforts. The most recent reauthorized Higher Education Act continued all of the Title IV programs in which we participate, but made many revisions to the requirements governing the Title IV programs, including provisions relating to the relationships between institutions and lenders that make student loans, student loan default rates, and the formula for revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the Title IV programs. Notwithstanding the lack of a full HEA reauthorization, Congress has annually appropriated funds for the existing Title IV programs under the HEA. In addition, further rulemaking by the Department of Education may impose additional requirements on institutions that participate in Title IV programs. Existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change based on HEA reauthorization. Additionally, funding for the student financial assistance programs may be affected during appropriations and budget actions.
Appropriations
Congress reviews and determines appropriations for Title IV programs on an annual basis. On February 18, 2022, the President signed the “Further Additional Extending Government Funding Act,” which provides fiscal year 2022 appropriations to Federal agencies through March 11, 2022. A future government shutdown, particularly one that includes the Department of Education or appropriations for Title IV programs, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
An elimination of certain Title IV programs, a reduction in federal funding levels of such programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education. Such reductions, in turn, could lead to lower enrollments at Strayer University or Capella University or require us to increase our reliance upon alternative sources of student financial aid. Given the significant percentage of our revenues that are derived indirectly from Title IV programs, the loss of, or a significant reduction in, Title IV program funds available to our students could have a material adverse effect on Strayer University, Capella University, and the Company.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has pursued enforcement actions against certain proprietary institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2021, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released its annual report analyzing more than 1,900 complaints the CFPB received from private student loan borrowers between September 1, 2020 and August 31, 2021 and more than 3,400 federal student loan financing complaints the CFPB received from federal student loan borrowers. We do not know what steps the CFPB or Congress may take in response to these actions and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
U.S. Department of Education
Title IV regulations applicable to Strayer University and Capella University have been subject to frequent revisions, many of which have increased the level of scrutiny to which higher education institutions are subjected and have raised applicable standards.
Current Federal Rulemaking
On August 10, 2021, the Department announced its intention to establish the Affordability and Student Loans committee, to prepare proposed regulations to address the following topics: borrower defense to repayment, misrepresentation, closed school discharges, discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability, discharges for false certification of student eligibility, loan repayment plans, interest capitalization, mandatory pre-dispute arbitration and prohibition of class action lawsuits provisions in institutions’ enrollment agreements and associated counseling about such arrangements, Pell Grant eligibility or prison education programs, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Department also announced the formation of a Prison Education Program Subcommittee. Negotiations occurred in October-December 2021, with negotiators reaching consensus on total and permanent disability discharge, eliminating interest capitalization for nonstatutory capitalization events, false certification discharge and Pell Grant eligibility for prison education programs. The committee failed to reach consensus on the remainder of the topics. In the absence of consensus, the Department of Education has discretion to propose a rule for public comment. Issue papers and redlines provided by the Department indicate the Department is 
considering changes to borrower to defense to repayment regulations that include eliminating a limitations period on claims, making the group claims process the default process for loan relief, establishing the borrower defense application as a form of evidence, and revising the definition of misrepresentation.
On December 8, 2021, the Department announced its intention to establish the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility committee, to prepare proposed regulations to address the following topics: 90/10, ability to benefit, certification procedures for participating in Title IV programs, change of ownership and change in control of institutions of higher education, financial responsibility for participating institutions of higher education, gainful employment, and standards of administrative capability. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022. 
We cannot predict the outcome of the negotiated rulemaking process.
College Affordability and Transparency Lists
The Department of Education publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of four categories, with (1) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (2) the highest “net price” for the most recent academic year, (3) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (4) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to the Department of Education explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. The Department of Education will report annually to Congress on these institutions and will publish their reports on its website. The Department of Education also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the four categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. Under the Higher Education Act, net price means average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted.
College Scorecard
In September 2015, the Department of Education publicly released its “College Scorecard” website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. In October 2017, the Department of Education announced that its Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System, or IPEDS, would publish for the first time completion data for part-time and non-first-time students, which provides additional information about institutions’ performance. The Department of Education updates the data available on the College Scorecard on a periodic basis. In 2019, the Department of Education added new metrics to the College Scorecard, including information on non-degree institutions and data concerning student outcomes, including salary, at the program level. The Department of Education continues to update data, metrics, and functionality of the College Scorecard.
Privacy and Data Security
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and its implementing regulations apply to all educational institutions that receive funding from the Department of Education. FERPA requires institutions to protect the privacy of personally identifiable information in education records maintained by the institution. Among other provisions, FERPA requires that institutions limit disclosure of personally identifiable information and provide students access to their educational records. The Department of Education enforces FERPA by initiating corrective actions against noncompliant institutions, which could lead to the loss of federal funding.
Recently, legislatures in a number of states have sought to enact privacy bills. These bills would protect consumer information in a variety of contexts and, unlike most federal privacy legislation, would not apply only within a specific sector. The most prominent of these bills is the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect in January 2020. The CCPA seeks to protect the personal information of California residents by giving those residents control over how the information is collected, used, and shared. These rights include the right to request details about the personal information a company has collected or shared and the ability to obtain copies of the personal information collected by the company, the ability to opt out of certain personal information sharing between companies, and the right to require that a company delete the personal information it maintains about the requesting individual. The California Attorney General oversees civil enforcement of the CCPA, which allows for civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for each intentional violation. In addition, the CCPA imposes on companies an obligation to maintain reasonable security procedures and empowers individuals to bring private actions to recover damages if their personal information is subject to a security breach as a result of a company’s failure to maintain reasonable security practices. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will expand the CCPA’s requirements when it becomes effective in 2023.
Collection of personal information outside the United States may subject companies to global privacy and data security laws. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which came into effect May 25, 2018, contains significant requirements to provide individuals with information about data collection, use, and sharing practices. The GDPR also provides individuals with rights to control how information about them is collected, used, and shared. It also requires that companies notify European regulators within 72 hours of a data breach. These measures generally exceed the requirements of U.S. state and federal privacy and data security laws. The GDPR applies to entities that process personal information (1) in the context of the activities of an establishment of the entity in the European Union (“EU”), regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not, or (2) of individuals who are in the EU, where the processing activities are related to (a) targeting of individuals in the EU in its offering of goods or services, or (b) the monitoring of the behavior of individuals in the EU as far as that behavior takes place within the EU. Noncompliance with the GDPR can result in administrative, civil, or criminal liability.
Australian and New Zealand Regulation
We operate two post-secondary educational institutions in Australia, Torrens University Australia Limited (“Torrens”) and Think: Colleges Pty Ltd (“Think”). In Australia, a distinction is made between higher education and vocational education organizations.
Higher education providers consist of public and private universities, Australian branches of overseas universities and other higher education providers. Higher education qualifications consist of undergraduate awards (bachelor’s degrees, associate degrees and diplomas) and postgraduate awards (graduate certificates and diplomas, master’s degrees and doctoral degrees). The regulation of higher education providers is undertaken at a national level by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (“TEQSA”). All organizations that offer higher education qualifications in or from Australia must be registered with TEQSA. Higher education providers must also have their courses of study accredited by TEQSA unless they have been granted and hold self-accrediting status. Torrens currently holds self-accrediting status, but Think does not. Registration as a higher education provider is for a fixed period of up to seven years. TEQSA regularly reviews the conduct and operation of accredited higher education providers.
The vocational education and training (“VET”) sector consists of technical and further education institutes, agricultural colleges, adult and community education providers, community organizations, industry skill centers and private providers. VET qualifications include certificates, diplomas and advanced diplomas. The regulation of VET providers is undertaken at a national level by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (“ASQA”). An organization providing VET courses in Australia must be registered by ASQA as a Registered Training Organisation (“RTO”). Courses offered by RTOs need to be accredited by ASQA. Registration as an RTO is for a fixed period of up to seven years. ASQA regularly reviews the conduct and operations of RTOs.
Torrens is one of 43 universities in Australia. It is a private, for-profit entity and is registered with TEQSA in the Australian University category. As a self-accrediting university, it is not required to have its individual courses of study accredited by TEQSA. Torrens is also registered with ASQA as an RTO and is thus entitled to offer vocational and training courses.
Think is one of approximately 5,000 RTOs in Australia and in that capacity is regulated by ASQA. It is also registered as a higher education provider with TEQSA. Its higher education courses require, and have received, accreditation by TEQSA.
Australia also maintains a Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (“CRICOS”) for Australian education providers that recruit, enroll and teach overseas students. Registration on CRICOS allows providers to offer courses to overseas students studying on Australian student visas. Both Torrens and Think are so registered.
The Commonwealth government has established income-contingent loan schemes that assist eligible fee-paying students to pay all or part of their tuition fees (separate but similar schemes exist for higher education and vocational courses). Under the schemes, the relevant fees are paid directly to the institutions by the Commonwealth government on behalf of the student. A corresponding obligation then exists from the participating student to the Commonwealth government, which is addressed by adding a levy to that student’s income tax until the loan amount has been repaid. Neither Torrens nor Think have any responsibility in connection with the repayment of these loans by students and, generally, this assistance is not available to international students. Both Torrens and Think are registered for the purposes of these plans (a precondition to their students being eligible to receive such loans).
We operate a post-secondary educational institution in New Zealand, Media Design School Limited (“MDS”). MDS is a Private Training Establishment, a private organization offering education or training. It is a globally renowned and specialist provider of design and creative technology education with qualifications ranging from diplomas to postgraduate degrees. MDS 
also has access to New Zealand Government student finance where study loans are offered to students who are New Zealand citizens or ordinarily resident in New Zealand, subject to certain conditions.
Privacy and Data Security
Privacy laws and regulations in other countries where the Company has significant international presence, including Australia’s Federal Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles and New Zealand’s Privacy Act, may also impact the manner in which the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are able to transfer and process personal information.
