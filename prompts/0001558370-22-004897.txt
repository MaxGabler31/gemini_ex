ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
XpresSpa Group, Inc. (“XpresSpa Group”) is one of the leading global travel health and wellness services holding companies. XpresSpa Group currently has three reportable operating segments: XpresSpa®, XpresTest, and Treat™.
​
XpresSpa Group’s subsidiary, XpresSpa Holdings, LLC (“XpresSpa”) has been a global airport retailer of spa services through its XpresSpa spa locations, offering travelers premium spa services, including massage, nail and skin care, as well as spa and travel products. 
​
In March 2020, we temporarily closed all global XpresSpa locations due to the categorization by local jurisdictions of the spa locations as “non-essential services.” XpresSpa reopened 22 locations as of December 31, 2021 as described under "Recent Developments -­ XpresSpa Premium Spa Services" below. We will evaluate reopening the remaining XpresSpa spa locations on a location-by-location basis as travel returns and resume normal operations at such selected locations once airport traffic returns to sufficient levels to support operations at a unit level, and achieve adequate unit-level economics, including acceptable profit levels as well as serves our longer-term strategy of offering fully integrated health and wellness services.
​
Since the beginning of the temporary closure of our XpresSpa locations, we successfully launched our XpresCheck® Wellness Centers, through XpresSpa Group’s subsidiary XpresTest, Inc. (“XpresCheck” or “XpresTest”), offering COVID-19 and other medical diagnostic testing services to the traveling public, as well as airline, airport and concessionaire employees, and TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. XpresCheck has entered into managed services agreements (“MSAs”) with professional medical services companies that provide health care services to patients. The medical services companies pay XpresCheck a monthly fee to operate in the XpresCheck Wellness Centers. Under the terms of the MSAs, we provide office space, equipment, supplies, non-licensed staff, and management services in return for the management fee. Also, we continue to evaluate alternative testing protocols and work in partnership with airlines and others for safe travels.
​
The third segment is Treat, which is operating through XpresSpa Group’s subsidiary Treat, Inc. (“Treat”) launched in 2021 as our new travel, health and wellness brand transforming the way we provide care to our customers through a suite of health and wellness services supported by an integrated digital platform and a relevant retail offering to the traveling public.
​
Treat’s on-site centers (currently located in JFK International Airport and opening in April 2022 in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and later this year in Salt Lake City International Airport) provide access to health and wellness services for travelers. Our teams provide travel-related diagnostic testing for virus, cold, flu and other illnesses as well as hydration therapy, IV drips, and vitamin injections. Travelers can purchase time blocks to use our wellness rooms to engage in interactive services like self-guided yoga, meditation and low impact weight exercises or to relax and unplug from the hectic pace of the airport and renew themselves before or after their trip.
​
Treat offers a website (www.treat.com) and mobile app to complement the offering with relevant health and wellness content designed to help people on the go with information that could impact their travel. The platform provides travelers access to a comprehensive online marketplace of services including global illness tracker tools such as the COVID-19 Requirements Map, on-demand chat care by licensed providers, a health wallet to store personal and family health records (including COVID-19 testing results), and a scheduler to arrange for direct care at one of our on-site locations.
​
Although we recognize three segments of business, our strategy for the future is to create and leverage a fully integrated set of products and services that are both profitable and scalable across our portfolio of brands. Additionally, we will expand our retail strategy, not only adding more products for sale but aligning those products more efficiently to our service offerings. This product strategy may include, for example, adding fortified water and hydration packets to the delivery of 

4



an onsite hydration IV or adding muscle relaxation patches to a neck or back massage to continue treatment after the delivery of the service. 
​
We also plan to build our capability for delivering health and wellness services outside the airport. We believe operating outside of the airport complements our offering and allows us to scale growth faster.
​
We will be looking to further expand internationally.  While international travel has not picked back up to pre-pandemic levels, we want to be opportunistic in our approach, taking advantage of the current market to grow in preparation for a full return of travel. We believe a strategy for international expansion further advances our overall biosurveillance efforts.
​
These strategic imperatives will be accomplished through development of an infrastructure specifically focused on enabling scalable and efficient growth.
​
While management has used all currently available information in assessing our business prospects, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our XpresCheck Wellness Centers and on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain and could have a material effect on our business.

​
During the fourth quarter of 2021, XpresCheck initiated a $2 million, eight-week pilot program with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with Concentric by Ginkgo. Under this program, XpresCheck is conducting biosurveillance monitoring at four major U.S. airports (JFK International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) aimed at identifying existing and new SARS-CoV-2 variants. On January 31, 2022, we announced the extension of the program, bringing the total contract to $5.6 million. Approximately $1.6 million of the original $2 million in revenue was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2021. We anticipate the remaining $4.0 million of the full $5.6 million amount will be realized during the first and second quarters of 2022.
XpresSpa Premium Spa Services
There are currently sixteen operating XpresSpa domestic locations (including one franchise location in Austin-Bergstrom International Airport) and we expect to re-open four additional domestic locations in the near-term. A significant number of the domestic XpresSpa locations are operating approximately eight hours per day during the busiest hours (compared to up to sixteen hours per day pre-pandemic) improving labor productivity. Additionally, XpresSpa implemented a price increase in mid-October 2021 which further improved profitability. As airport volumes improve, we will continue to review our operating hours to optimize revenue opportunity.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we began testing several new services to take advantage of a growing interest in non-traditional spa services and expansion of our retail offering to align more closely with the services we provide. We are evaluating the success of these new initiatives at each airport on an on-going basis and will incorporate changes to our approach as more of the portfolio is reactivated.

There are also six international locations operating, including three XpresSpa locations in Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates and three XpresSpa locations in Schiphol Amsterdam Airport in the Netherlands. We have also signed for an additional five locations at Istanbul Airport and expect to open the first store during the summer of 2022.

HyperPointe Acquisition

In January 2022, we announced and closed on the acquisition of GCG Connect, LLC d/b/a HyperPointe. HyperPointe is a leading digital healthcare and data analytics relationship marketing agency servicing the global healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. HyperPointe has significant experience in patient and healthcare professional marketing and deep technological experience with CXM (customer experience management) and data analytics. Since June 2020, HyperPointe’s management team and suite of services and technology have been used to develop and deploy the technological infrastructure needed to scale the growth of our XpresCheck business HyperPointe’s experience in this space continues to serve the XpresCheck business and should play a critical role in the expansion of on-going biosurveillance efforts.

Terms of the transaction were $5.6 million in cash, and $1 million in common stock, as well as potential additional earn-out payments of up to $7.5 million over a three-year timeframe based upon future performance; these earn-out payments may be satisfied in cash or common stock or a combination thereof subject to various terms and conditions.

HyperPointe currently operates as a stand-alone entity within XpresSpa Group. Ezra Ernst, the current Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of HyperPointe, also serves as CEO of XpresCheck, reporting to Scott Milford, XpresSpa Group’s CEO. Mr. Ernst is spearheading efforts to further integrate XpresCheck’s biosurveillance screening and testing business with HyperPointe’s customer experience management technology and data management know how in the healthcare and pharmaceutical verticals to further drive new revenue opportunities.
​
Reverse Stock Split
On June 11, 2020, we effected a 1-for-3 reverse stock split, whereby every three shares of our common stock was reduced to one share of our common stock and the price per share of our common stock was multiplied by 3. All references to shares and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
Our Strategy and Outlook
We believe that our company is well positioned to benefit from consumers’ growing interest and pent-up demand in travel health and wellness and increasing demand for health and wellness related services and products. Our go-forward plan includes the expansion and integration of products and services across our three brands; the execution of an ‘off-airport’ strategy to deliver more products and services; the implementation of an international expansion plan; and ensuring we can scale our growth in a responsible way that drives shareholder value. 
​
XpresSpa was created for travelers to address the stress and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness. It is a well-recognized and popular airport spa brand with a dominant market share in the United States, with nearly three times the number of domestic locations as its closest competitor.
​
As travel needs changed based on new health and passenger safety concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, we created a companion company, XpresCheck, which is also in airports and which offers COVID-19 testing and other medical diagnostic testing services to airport employees and the traveling public.

Further, the Company continues developing Treat, a travel health and wellness brand that is positioned for a post-pandemic world and that leverages our historic travel wellness experience and newly acquired healthcare expertise. The Company sees this concept evolution as a significant opportunity to be a category innovator in a new niche industry where it can leverage technology in addition to its existing real estate and airport experience in providing travelers with peace of mind and access to integrated care. 
​
While COVID-19 testing will be available under this new brand, the broader suite of services may include: pre-travel health and wellness planning. Treat’s on-site centers (currently located in JFK International Airport and in April 2022 in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and later this year in Salt Lake City International Airport) intend to provide access to health and wellness services for travelers. Our teams provide travel-related diagnostic testing for virus, cold, flu and other illnesses as well as hydration therapy, IV Drips, and vitamin injections. Travelers can purchase time blocks to use our wellness rooms to engage in interactive services like self-guided yoga, meditation and low impact weight exercises or to relax and unplug from the hectic pace of the airport and renew themselves before or after their trip.
​
Although we recognize three segments of business, our strategy for the future, is to create and leverage a fully integrated set of products and services that are both profitable and scalable across our portfolio of brands. Additionally, we will expand our retail strategy, not only adding more products for sale but aligning those products more efficiently to our service offerings. For example, adding fortified water and hydration packets to the delivery of an onsite hydration IV or adding muscle relaxation patches to a neck or back massage to continue treatment after the delivery of the service. 
​
We also plan to build our capability for delivering health and wellness services outside the airport. We believe operating outside of the airport complements our offering and allows us to scale growth faster.
​
We will be looking to further expand internationally. While international travel has not picked back up to pre-pandemic levels, we want to be opportunistic in our approach, taking advantage of the current market to grow in preparation for a full return of travel. We believe a strategy for international expansion further advances our overall biosurveillance efforts.
​
These strategic imperatives will be accomplished through development of an infrastructure specifically focused on enabling scalable and efficient growth.
​
​
Impairment
​
We completed an assessment of our property and equipment and operating lease right of use assets for impairment as of December 31, 2021. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded an impairment expense related to property and equipment and operating lease right of use assets of $90,130 and $747,497 respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included in Impairment/disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The expense was primarily related to the impairment of leasehold improvements made to certain XpresSpa spa locations and operating lease right of use assets where management determined that the locations discounted future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets over the remaining lease term. 
​
We completed an assessment of our intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2021 and determined that these assets were not impaired as the majority of the assets are related to our new business brand Treat which opened its first location in December 2021. It is still too early to determine impairment for Treat due to its early business stage. 
​
In 2020 we recorded an impairment expense of approximately $5.0 million, $3.9 million, and $6.3 million related to property and equipment, intangible assets, and operating lease right of use assets, respectively, which is included in Impairment/disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2020. This expense was related to the impairment of the XpresSpa trademarks, where management determined that in light of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the XpresSpa brand’s discounted future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets.

The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, the actions to contain or treat its impact and vaccinations. 
​
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material adverse effect on our XpresSpa business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects in the near-term and beyond 2022. While we have used all currently available information in our forecasts, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is highly uncertain. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which at the present time are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy. 
Chief Executive Officer Transition

Mr. Scott R. Milford, previously our Chief Operating Officer was promoted to the CEO effective January 19, 2022. Mr. Milford, 57, has served as the Company’s Chief People Officer since July 2019 until his promotion to the Chief Operating Officer in December 2020. Before joining the Company, he served as VP, People Operations of SoulCycle from January to July 2019. Prior to that, he served as Chief People Officer for Bayada Home Health during 2018. Previously, he was Senior Vice President – Human Resources for Le Pain Quotidien from 2016 to 2018, and Senior Vice President – Human Resources for Town Sports from 2009 to 2015. His other relevant experience includes senior Human Resources leadership positions at Starbucks Coffee Company (2003-2008), Universal Music Group (1999-2003), and Blockbuster Entertainment and its parent Viacom International (1991-1999).
​
Competition
Our domestic units operate within many of the largest and most heavily trafficked airports in the United States. The balance of the domestic market is highly fragmented and is represented largely by small, privately-owned entities.  The largest domestic competitor operated 21 locations in11 airports in the United States.
There are no other multi-city multi-airport operators. Competition, where present, is typically a locally based health system urgent care center, or heath provider, or a contracted vendor of the airport.
Our Market
Airport retailers differ significantly from traditional retailers. Unlike traditional retailers, airport retailers benefit from a steady and largely predictable flow of traffic from a constantly changing customer base. Airport retailers also benefit from “dwell time,” the period after travelers have passed through airport security and before they board an aircraft. For over 15 years, increased security requirements have led travelers to spend more time at the airport. In addition, in anticipation of the long and often stressful security lines, travelers allow for more time to get through security and, as a result, often experience increased downtime prior to boarding. XpresSpa was developed to address the stressful and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time productively, by relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness. 
We believe that XpresSpa Group is well positioned to benefit from consumers’ growing interest in health and wellness and increasing demand for products and services designed to improve overall health and well-being.
​
In addition, a confluence of microeconomic events has created favorable conditions for the expansion of retail concepts at airports, in particular, retail concepts that attract higher spending from air travelers. The competition for airplane landings has forced airports to lower landing fees, which in turn has necessitated augmenting their retail offerings to offset budget shortfalls. Infrastructure projects at airports across the country, again intended to make an airport more desirable to airlines, require funding from bond issuances that in turn rely upon, in part, the expected minimum rent guarantees and expected income from concessionaires.
Equally as important to the industry growth is XpresSpa Group’s flexible, valuable and desirable retail format and footprint within the airport retail segment. Before the pandemic, XpresSpa Group historically opened multiple locations annually, which have ranged in size from 200 square feet to 2,600 square feet, with a typical size of approximately 800 square feet.

XpresSpa Group has been able to adapt its operating model to almost any size location available in space constrained airports. This increased flexibility compared to other retail concepts has allowed, and will continue to allow XpresSpa Group to operate multiple stores within an airport, including in some cases for different concepts.
XpresSpa Group believes that its operating metrics represent an attractive return on invested capital and, as a result, is pursuing new locations at airports and terminals around the country. Historically, XpresSpa has won the majority of all requests for proposal (“RFP”) in which it has participated.
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, effective March 24, 2020, we temporarily closed all global spa locations, largely due to the categorization of our spa locations by local jurisdictions as “non-essential services”. Normal market conditions and travel behavior were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Similar to many businesses in the travel sector, our business has been materially and adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Most of the domestic travel restrictions have been lifted as of December 31, 2021 and we believe that travel conditions are slowly returning to pre pandemic level. We have reopened sixteen locations out of our total domestic portfolio of thirty one Spas. As travel slowly returns, our intention is to continue to review our portfolio and reopen spas once airport traffic returns to sufficient levels to support our operations and achieve adequate unit-level economics, including acceptable profit levels as well as serves our longer-term strategy of offering fully integrated health and wellness services.
​
The market for XpresCheck is predominantly airline passengers requiring a negative COVID test at their destinations to avoid quarantine, with much smaller components of airline employees and general public electing testing at the airport. We believe this market will continue to exist into and potentially beyond 2023, albeit with some changes in the size and test types.
Our new concept envisions delivering integrated health and wellness care, through technology and services, accessed at on-site airport wellness centers as well as outside of airports. We expect this travel health and wellness brand to expand our relevant market well beyond the flying passengers of the airports, in which we have a physical presence, and into a digital experience before, during and after travel. We also believe these offerings will be more relevant products and services and hence consumed by a greater portion of our target population.
Regulation
Our operations are subject to a range of laws and regulations adopted by national, regional and local authorities from the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to, among others, licensing (e.g., massage, nail, and cosmetology), public health and safety and fire codes. Failure to obtain or retain required licenses and approvals, including those related to licensing, public health and safety and fire codes, would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, significant problems obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits or approvals could delay or prevent the opening, or adversely impact the viability, of our operations.
Airport authorities in the United States frequently require that our airport concessions meet minimum Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise ("ACDBE") participation requirements. The Department of Transportation’s (“DOT”) ACDBE program is implemented by recipients of DOT Federal Financial Assistance, including airport agencies that receive federal funding. The ACDBE program is administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), state and local ACDBE certifying agencies and individual airports. The ACDBE program is designed to help ensure that small firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals can compete for airport contracting and concession opportunities in domestic passenger service airports. The ACDBE regulations require that airport recipients establish annual ACDBE participation goals, review the scope of anticipated large prime contracts throughout the year, and establish contract specific ACDBE participation goals. We generally meet the contract specific goals through an agreement providing for co-ownership of the retail location with a disadvantaged business enterprise. Frequently, and within the guidelines issued by the FAA, we may lend money to ACDBEs in connection with concession agreements in order to help the ACDBE fund the capital investment required under a concession agreement. The rules and regulations governing the certification of ACDBE participation in airport concession agreements are complex, and ensuring ongoing compliance is costly and time consuming. Further, if we fail to comply with the minimum ACDBE participation requirements in our concession agreements, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which could result in the 

10



termination of a concession agreement and monetary damages. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business Operations – Failure to comply with minimum airport concession disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals and requirements could lead to lost business opportunities or the loss of existing business.”
We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Affordable Care Act, the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and various federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wages, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, which may require us to design or modify our concession locations to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.
We are also subject to certain truth-in-advertising, general customs, consumer and data protection, product safety, workers’ health and safety and public health rules that govern retailers in general, as well as the merchandise sold within the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
We are also subject to HIPAA and the HITECH Act as they relate to patients’ Protected Health Information (PHI), patient rights, breach notification and other actions.
