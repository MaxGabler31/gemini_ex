COMPANY BACKGROUND
 
Evolving Systems was founded in 1985 to provide software and services to the U.S. telecommunications industry.  During our early years our product focus was on solutions that supported number management and number porting. In November 2004, we expanded our product set and geographical reach with the acquisition of Tertio Telecoms Ltd. (Evolving Systems U.K.), a supplier of Operations Support Systems (OSS) software solutions for service activation and mediation to communication carriers throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. With this acquisition we not only expanded our markets beyond North America, we also added service activation and mediation solutions to our product portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded our product and service capabilities, allowing us to address a larger portion of our customers OSS application needs with a balanced mix of products as well as services.  The Companys focus was primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, selfservice mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation and management of services.
 
On October 24, 2013 we acquired privately held Telespree Communications (Telespree), now known as Evolving Systems Labs, Inc. (Evolving Systems Labs), for an initial payment of approximately $1.6 million, comprised of approximately $0.8 million in cash and approximately $0.8 million in stock.  There was an earn-out provision whereby we potentially would have made additional payments in cash on the achievement of certain financial targets for the period from October 25, 2013 through October 24, 2016.  This provision was not achieved and was recognized as other income in 2016.  In addition, there is a final payment of $0.5 million to be made subject to reduction for certain claims.  The final payment has not been made as of the date of this Form 10-K was filed.  The acquisition included technology used in the delivery and management of mobile data services and a portfolio of SaaS based solutions.
 
On September 30, 2015, we acquired privately held SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC, Inc. (Evolving Systems NC) for an initial cash payment totaling approximately $9.75 million, plus customary working capital adjustments, and we agreed to make a payment of $250,000 on the one-year anniversary of the transaction, with such payment being available to secure SSMs representations and warranties under the acquisition agreement. The acquisition included SSMs software solution, RLM, a platform which enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time as well as a platform for Customer Loyalty and Retention.  The final payment has not been made as of the date this Form 10-K was filed due to pending resolution of outstanding claims.
 
On July 3, 2017, BLS Limited (EVOL BLS), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the purchase of Business Logic Systems Limited (BLS).  EVOL BLS and BLS are both companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.  Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2017 (the Purchase Agreement), the BLS will sell substantially all of its assets and transfer certain liabilities relating to BLSs business of providing customer value management solutions and data driven marketing solutions for £1.2 million ($1.6 million) in cash, plus (a) an additional sum of £0.1million ($0.1 million), reduced by any sums paid by EVOL BLS for certain employee severance obligations (collectively, the Cash Payments); (b) a percentage of collections on certain receivables over a 24  month period; and (c) an earnout equal to 50% of BLS based revenue over defined threshold levels for a period of 3 years after the closing date. BLS specializes in data-driven customer value management and customer engagement solutions that have been implemented in over 20 mobile operators in Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean. BLS solutions turn customer data into actionable insights and personalized contextual offers. Customer engagement occurs through in-bound and out-bound offers and is further extended through a suite of loyalty and retention solutions.
 
On September 7, 2017 EVOL Holdings acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of four (4) Lumata Holdings (Seller) subsidiaries, Lumata Entities, in exchange for a cash payment totaling 4.0 million ($4.8 million), subject to certain adjustments.  The Seller and certain members of the Sellers management entered into Management Warranty Deeds to secure Lumata Holdings representations and warranties under the Purchase Agreement and, to the extent the amounts provided under the Management Warranty Deeds are not sufficient to satisfy post-closing claims, EVOL Holdings may seek recovery from the Guarantor in an amount not to exceed 0.4 million ($0.5 million).  In connection with the Acquisition, EVOL Holdings entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement, a Debenture and a Subordination Deed with East West Bank as lender in the amount of $4,730,000 (collectively, the Loan Facility Agreements).
 
The Lumata Entities are a leading global provider of real-time, next generation loyalty and customer lifecycle management software and services that helps businesses gain value from their customer data for relevant and contextual insights and actions of value to both customers and enterprises. Its customers are mobile operators including Orange, Telefonica and other Tier-1 and emerging operators in Europe and around the world. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to our operations once the integration of the business is completed during 2018.
 
Evolving Systems, through its acquisitions of Sixth Sense Media, Business Logic Systems and Lumata is now a leader in real-time digital engagement solutions and services that drives increases in customer lifetime value through increases in customer acquisition and activation, the extension of customer lifetime and the increase in customer value and revenues in the converging

mobile, entertainment, financial and retail services eco-system. We now also have one of the industrys best teams of experts, experience and platforms to help drive service providers increase their customer lifetime value (CLV) over the course the customer lifecycle.
 
INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
 
The market for digital engagement to increase customer life time value through increased customer acquisition, customer retention and value management is growing. Several key factors are driving carrier demand for next generation solutions, supporting growth for specific products within the sector:
 
·                      Carriers seeking to further monetize their customer relationships and associated demographic, behavioral, location and contextual information to up-sell their network services and open new channels for optimized and personalized third-party service revenues;
 ·                      Rapid adoption of smart phones and network-attached devices, driving increased usage of mobile data;
 ·                      On-going network investment in 5G and Internet of things (IoT) networks is driving increased demand for digital engagement solutions
 ·                      Pricing pressure within the telecom industry driven by relatively flat subscriber growth, network upgrade costs, subscriber churn, and increased competition from traditional and new market entrants such as Over-the-Top (OTT) services both in the developed and emerging markets; and
 ·                      Adoption of the Enterprise Mobility and Machine to Machine (M2M) requirements are driving further demand.
 
Today, carriers are compelled to offer a growing array of services to deliver personalized and differentiated user experiences, reduce subscriber churn and maintain or grow market share. These value-added services have to be delivered to the market in ever shorter windows as competitive pressure has increased the velocity at which carriers deliver new products and services. To achieve these objectives, operators are increasingly reliant on flexible service enablement solutions that offer a myriad of options for their subscribers.
 
As network migrations to 5G, IoT and M2M accelerate the SIM card and embedded SIM (eSIM) have emerged as a vital links in the end to end value chain. Evolving Systems full life cycle management of SIMs and eSIMs from ordering, dynamically activating and managing the SIM card is becoming an important component in the service providers infrastructure, both to reduce operating costs associated with the provisioning of SIM cards, as well as to improve the end-user experience. We are a pioneer and leader in this market and believe we are well-positioned to maintain our leadership role in this growth segment.  To date our Subscriber Activation solution has activated over half a billion SIM cards, providing enhanced functionality and significant operator savings.
 
In a market where consumers perceive their telecoms services as a commodity, maintaining or growing customer value and retaining valuable customers is a persistent challenge. Customers are demanding ever greater incentives for their loyalty, attracted by disruptive OTT alternatives and competitive offers on data, airtime, and SMS. This can lead to a spiral of price-driven value destruction unless a truly differentiated approach is used to stand out from the crowd and deliver superior value.
 
The digital revolution offers unparalleled opportunities to generate new revenue streams, create highly relevant and differentiated offerings, and deliver more engaging customer experiences to the growing universe of connected consumers. But digital requires a whole new way of interacting with consumers in real-time, via multiple channels such as apps, web, email, as well as traditional SMS, in a highly contextual manner. Having a deep understanding of customer preferences and behaviour is critical in this digital environment full of demanding customers.
 
Mobile service is ubiquitous and mobile operators are the digital enablers between consumers and brands, the trusted processors of customer data, uniquely able to bridge the digital and physical world through their technology infrastructure. The mobile industry is going through a transition period. Traditional voice and messaging revenues are in decline due to several factors including the over-the-top OTT players. Mobile data demand is growing.  Service providers are focused on building upon their brand and their last mile connectivity to more actively engage their customers  and to increase the customer wallet-share through digital and non-digital partnerships.
 
Evolving Systems can help Telcos navigate through the digital marketing jungle of fragmented technologies, converging communication channels and data overload through our portfolio of digital engagement solutions.  Evolving Systems combines big ideas and a deep understanding of mobile customer behaviour with powerful software capabilities to create digital engagement & loyalty experiences that stand out from the crowd.

We sit at the intersection of technology and marketing. Our solutions leverage mechanics such as digital vouchering, digital badges, in-app engagement, etc. to drive a two-sided business model, where we generate value from 3rd party brands, as well as retail customers. It is a virtuous circle where customers increase spend and extend tenure in return for perceived high value rewards and experiences, which brands provide in order to access a highly targeted mobile customer base.
 
This is important because connecting brands and consumers via a digital platform, positions the mobile operator at the center of commerce, content, and communication flows in the connected world. Mobile operators have access to accurate data on customer preferences, behaviour, spending, etc.. While it is critical to ensure customer opt-in for data use, industry research confirms that consumers will allow a trusted mobile operator to use customer information in return for highly relevant and attractive incentives from brands.
 
DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO
 
Acquisition and Activation
 
Our Subscriber Acquisition and Activation solutions support carriers in adding new subscribers to their network, from the sales and contract process through to the allocation of network and service resources and the activation of services to the mobile device.
·                  Smart Dealer provides SIM retailers with a tool set that enables them to sell SIM cards efficiently and effectively. With Smart Dealer, the operator is able to communicate and guide dealers towards using the latest promotions, enabling instant reactions to competitor activities.  Smart Dealer captures subscriber details for Know Your Customer prepaid registration, including biometric data, using standard, low cost devices.
 
·                  Dynamic SIM AllocationTM is a SIM Activation solution which is integrated into the carriers signaling network, enabling new SIM cards that have not been pre-provisioned to be detected on first use. This triggers an efficient, dynamic provisioning process and eliminates the need for pre-provisioning, thus lowering the operators costs of subscriber acquisition. The SIM activation occurs only when a SIM card is first used. During the activation process, the solution enables an on-device interaction with the end-user, delivering a differentiated user-experience, reducing customer churn and boosting revenue for the carrier.
 
·                  Tertio® Service Activation is used by carriers to activate a new subscriber or to add a new service to an existing subscriber.  Our solution provides a flexible operating environment for carriers to manage their voice, data, and content service needs for both their traditional and broadband IP networks. It provides a point of flexibility in the carriers OSS/BSS architecture, allowing fast introduction of new network technologies and easing the burden of integration with existing devices and systems. Service providers who use our Tertio solution can better plan, manage and execute the introduction of new services.
·                  Number Inventory and Management is a scalable and fully automated solution that enables operators to reliably and efficiently manage their telephone numbers (i.e. SIMs, MSISDNs, IMSIs, Integrated Circuit Card Identifiers (ICCIDs) as well as other communication identifiers such as Uniform Resource Locators or (URLs) and email addresses. Our solution focuses on the automation of all number resource management processes, allowing operators to adhere to regulatory requirements and effectively manage the lifecycle of telephone numbers, as well as benefit from time savings and reduced costs.
Analytics and Value Management
 
Our Analytics and Value Management solutions empower marketing departments to create and deploy highly personalized, location and contextually relevant, interactive customer engagement campaigns.  Our cutting-edge Evolution platform enables us to deliver a full-service solution in a cloud SaaS model or hosted on-site, worldwide. The platform monitors customer events and behavioural patterns in real-time, building a profile of each subscriber. When the right conditions are met, the platform pushes the best match or a personalized offer or ad to the customer.
 
Compared with many other marketing campaign management systems, our solution more accurately targets marketing messages and campaigns that drive incremental revenue more quickly.

·                  The Profiling Engine supports static as well as ongoing dynamic profiling of subscribers. It fully supports any real-time or micro segmentation requirements as needed by the business. The Profiling Engine is a rules-driven flexible aggregator of subscriber baseline and usage data. It has been designed to handle any data model, including any data representation that may be available within the carriers legacy billing and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) environment.
·                  The Campaign Engine is used to configure and deliver marketing campaigns and offers to subscribers. It includes a business friendly dashboard that enables rapid configuration, testing and launching of new business campaigns. Through the dashboard the business user can target specific subscribers, define offers and rewards, and create personalized messages per campaign, interaction and subscriber. The dashboard provides a real-time view on each campaigns effectiveness and impact.
·                  Campaign Modules provide predefined templates for specific types of real-time mobile marketing tactics, including marketing for data bundles, digital services such as music, video, movies, gaming, entertainment, and mobile money as well as non-digital services including retail offers.
·                  Social Media Integration enables carriers to expand their engagement with subscribers beyond simple network usage and direct channels and can support social marketing campaigns that leverage the subscribers as a part of the marketing network.
·                  App Promotion engages subscribers when they are first configuring new services or when they are upgrading to mobile devices with new capabilities. It enables carriers to promote the use of their own mobile applications for subscriber care, and also those of third party app publishers, opening possibilities for new revenue streams.
Customer Retention and Loyalty
 
Evolvings Customer Retention and Loyalty solutions help reduce churn, extend the customer lifetime and generate more revenue from existing subscribers by using the latest innovative programs. Strong subscriber loyalty is created by rewarding subscribers via schemes that offer additional carrier services or the services and products of participating partners.
 
Brand partnerships are the true differentiators given the commoditization of typical carrier offers in the market. Some of the examples of Digital Engagement concepts we have created include Orange Wednesdays Film Sponsorship, Recharge & Instant Win, the largest points system with 28 million customers online and two of the most successful loyalty programs in the tough African market.  Badges, a highly-successful next generation loyalty eco-system with gamification, is another break-through innovation that is very successful among European mobile operators. These concepts were designed with specific mechanics that work within the local market in conjunction with brand partners.  They are successful solutions which endure, because of key ingredients such as simple customer journeys, perceived high value rewards and innovative engagement mechanics in conjunction with strategic brand partnerships.
 
The key modules include:
 
·                  Loyalty Points and Programs are used to reward mobile subscribers for use of the carriers services. Credit is earned in the forms of status points and bonus points. Gamification can be used to encourage the collection of rewards by subscribers and comparison with others in their social group. Loyalty Credit is then exchanged for services or discounts from the carrier, or for digital and physical goods from third party businesses and retail partners.
·                  Coupon, Voucher and Badges Management covers the whole lifecycle of coupons, vouchers and badges as a medium for delivering rewards. Our solution manages the interface with partners, the delivery of coupons to subscribers, redemption for digital or physical goods, and settlement between carrier and partner.
·                  Digital Engagement Engine includes several solution components:
 
·                  Proprietary framework for engagement concept design and partner selection
 ·                  Flexible business rules to define tiers to earn, burn or transfer credits
 ·                  Multi-variable definition to calculate loyalty, including spend, tenure, social advocacy, brand engagement, digital maturity, etc.
 ·                  Intelligent predictive analytics engine and segmentation capability

·                  Channel agnostic redemption capability with standard partner APIs to connect into Point of Sale retail systems and other redemption networks
 ·                  Tier1 carrier grade data capture and configurable provisioning engine

Our services cover all aspects of the project lifecycle, including system architecture, design, software development and customization, system integration, testing, live deployment and production support, program and project level management, post-implementation maintenance and domain and product expertise.
 
Our Managed Services can be delivered on-site at a carrier or remotely. Services range from operational support of our software solutions, through technical services to expand those solutions with new modules and functionality to support new business value, to marketing and customer engagement consultancy that directly drives marketing campaigns for our customers and helps them achieve their business objectives. The Managed Services teams also offer their expertise and experience to create the maximum financial impact to the carrier from using our solutions.
 
Our teams work closely with customers and integration partners and have established long-term relationships with operators in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
Our Product Development teams develop our software solutions internally in our labs in North Carolina, France, Romania and India. We conduct research to identify specific industry and customer business needs as well as market requirements and we use that information to determine our investment in product development. We evaluate the market for new products and we leverage our existing product capabilities with enhancements of existing products.  We build investment plans for our principal product areas and we make other investments in tools and product extensions to accelerate the development, implementation and integration process for customer solutions.
 
The Evolution platform, a combination of software capabilities through each of the acquisitions will provide a powerful environment to configure and operate rich Customer Lifecycle Journeys from Acquisition to Retention through variety of Engagement Models, Offer Schemes and Loyalty Programs. Primarily designed to address integrated mobile Digital Engagement needs it can accommodate any type of customer and any type of use case. The platforms Customer Journey Manager will be responsible for profiling individual engagements to enable better insights and more automation. This approach produces more relevant and engaging predictions and offers for us to present to customers.
 
The platform will provide service providers with unmatched Artificial Intelligence based on smart data and operational predictive analytics functions enabling to improve efficiency and to maximize revenues, all the while reducing time and effort to execute hundredss of micro-segmented engagement and offers. Evolving Systems is looking to take its digital engagement readiness solution for carriers beyond just enabling customers to use their traditional data. The new platform will move beyond its current SQL engine to using a Docker-optimized Kafka-powered Big Data platform. This will enable the real-time processing of multiple data-streams for unlimited flexibility and scalability.

Gathering all knowhow acquired by Evolving, the Evolution platform will be used to operate the most innovative large-scale loyalty programs, as well as to provide unique mechanics enabling gamification, optimization and personalization across a variety of channels. It will enable to engage with customers at all stage of their lifecycle, providing interactive dialogue and smart recommendations through all available traditional and digital channels. The platform will seamlessly integrate within the service providers IT infrastructure, either on premises or on private cloud. It will be operated or managed as a service depending on the market needs.
 
Product Development is expensed as incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we expensed $2.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in development costs.  The majority of product development investments in 2017 went into the further development and enhancement of our RLM and DSA solutions.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Our sales force is primarily a field organization structured to focus on specific geographical territories around the world including North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States (comprised of Russia and other former Soviet Republics), South Asia and Asia Pacific. Our sales activities cover direct sales to enterprise customers as well as sales through partners and resellers. Partners include Ericsson and Gemalto who include our products as part of their wider solution offerings and systems integrators such as IBM, TechMahindra and Wipro who license our technology to customers as part of their delivery engagements. The Resellers include regional or country specific companies that manage our customer relationships in countries where English is not the primary language.
 
Our solutions and our customers infrastructures are complex, and require a high degree of consultative selling which often results in a long sales cycle in excess of twelve months. In addition, our business relies on incremental revenue from existing customers, which requires regular interaction with customers to discuss enhancements to our existing solutions as well as the introduction of new features and functionality. The sales team is also responsible for making proactive proposals to prospects, as well as managing and delivering responses to competitive tenders. This complex, highly interactive approach, typically results in a long sales cycle, requiring us to invest a considerable amount of time developing business opportunities without guaranteed sales.
 
Our marketing organization supports our sales activities by identifying markets for our products and establishing an awareness of our offerings in those markets through a combination of direct marketing, web marketing, and participation in shows, conferences, and industry bodies. The marketing organization is responsible for maintaining our web site and creating electronic and print-based sales collateral to support our sales activities and lead generation.
 
COMPETITION
 
The market for telecommunications OSS products and mobile analytics and advertising is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, changing industry standards, regulatory developments and consolidation. We face increasing demand for improved product performance, enhanced functionality, rapid integration capabilities; all in the context of continuing pricing pressure. Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that often have substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and other resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with telecommunications customers. The market for telecommunications OSS software and services is extremely large and we currently hold only a small portion of total market share.  Nonetheless, we believe our work to establish the Subscriber Acquisition and Activation area has resulted in our achieving a measurable and reasonable market share in those areas.
 
Our principal competitors for Subscriber Acquisition and Activation are vendors such as Comptel-Nokia, Amdocs and Oracle, as well as billing vendors and vendors such as Ericsson.  In the area of Subscriber Acquisition and Activation, we believe we hold a significant leadership position; however, we see occasional competition from Giesecke & Devrient GmbH and HP, as well as a few other smaller regional competitors
 
Competitors for Digital Engagement Customer Value Management, Retention and Loyalty, include specialist vendors such as Pontis (acquired by Amdocs), CRM software from vendors such as SAP and Oracle, Analytics software from vendors like SAS and a few independent software companies like FlyTxt and Pelatro.
 
For all of our products, our ability to compete successfully depends on a wide range of factors.  First and foremost is our ability to deliver both marketing services and expert services based on our solutions platform, which offers a cost-effective way for our customers to benefit from our many years of experience and product investment. We deliver value by offering competitively priced quality solutions, tailored specifically to our customers network and IT infra-structure. After a customer implements our products, we often receive subsequent orders for enhancements to add functionality or increase capacity.  Complex solutions tailored to customers needs are expensive and time consuming to replace, thus providing us with an incumbent advantage. Furthermore,

many of our customer relationships span five years or more.  We believe all of these factors give us a competitive advantage and can be a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
 
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017 one significant customer accounted for 11%  of revenue from operations.  This customer is a large telecommunications operator in Europe.   For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no significant customer exceeded the threshold (defined as contributing at least 10%) of revenue from operations.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have 16 patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and other products.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 314 people including 17 in the United States, 126 in the United Kingdom and European Union and 171 in India.  This includes 111 employees from the recent acquisitions.  Of our worldwide staff, 80% are involved in product delivery, development, support and professional services, 4% in sales and marketing, and 16% in general administration.  The number and mix of our staff was significantly affected by the recent acquisitions and changes may occur in the coming year.  The Company also engages with multiple contractors in various countries to allow us to service our global customers.
