General
 Ultra Petroleum Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”, “Ultra”, “our”, “we”, or “us”) is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, production, operation, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. The Company was incorporated in 1979, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Ultra remains a Canadian company, and since March 2000, has operated under the laws of Yukon, Canada pursuant to Section 190 of the Yukon Business Corporations Act. The Company’s principal business activities are developing and producing its long-life natural gas reserves in the Pinedale and Jonah fields of the Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming.

 Oil and Gas Properties Overview 
 Principal Operating Area
 Ultra’s operations in southwest Wyoming have historically focused on developing its long-life natural gas reserves in a tight gas sand trend located in the Green River Basin. The Company targets sands of the upper Cretaceous Lance Pool in the Pinedale and Jonah fields. The Lance Pool, as administered by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”), includes sands of the Lance formation at depths between approximately 8,000 and 12,000 feet and the Mesaverde formation at depths between approximately 12,000 and 14,000 feet. As of December 31, 2018, Ultra owned interests in approximately 114,000 gross (79,000 net) acres in Wyoming covering approximately 190 square miles.  Following the sale of the Company’s Pennsylvania properties in late 2017 and Utah assets in late 2018, all oil and gas operations are now focused in the Pinedale and Jonah fields.
 2018 and 2017 Divestitures
 The Company previously had operations in the Uinta Basin in Utah and in north central Pennsylvania. 
 On September 25, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Utah assets for net cash proceeds of $69.3 million, including management fees of $0.6 million. The divested assets consisted primarily of oil and gas properties.  Prior to the sale, production from the Company’s Utah assets totaled approximately 420,000 Bbl of oil and 745,000 Mcf of natural gas in 2018. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company divested its properties in the Pennsylvania Devonian aged Marcellus Shale, for net cash proceeds of approximately $115.0 million. Prior to the sale, production from the Pennsylvania assets totaled approximately 11.2 million Mcf of natural gas in 2017.
 Mission and Strategy
 Ultra’s mission is to profitably grow as an upstream oil and gas company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders.  Ultra’s strategy to achieve this goal includes managing its portfolio of assets in Wyoming, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital investment, maximizing earnings and cash flows by controlling costs, utilizing advancements in drilling technologies to maximize results, and improving its financial flexibility.
 High Return Portfolio.  Ultra seeks to maintain a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects.  The Company evaluates opportunities for the acquisition, exploration, and development of additional oil and natural gas properties that afford risk-adjusted returns in excess of or equal to its current set of investment alternatives. 
 Disciplined Capital Investment.  The Company’s business strategy includes proactive and regular review of its portfolio of investment opportunities with a focus on investments that produce positive returns in order to optimize return to its shareholders.  The Company seeks to develop the resource from existing assets, while spending within cash flows in order to maximize profitability.  
 Focus on Maximizing Value.  Ultra strives to maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry in terms of both adding and producing oil and natural gas reserves.    The Company continues to focus on improving its drilling and production results using advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of its properties, while maintaining its low-cost structure, adhering to industry and regulatory best practices, maintaining strict safety and environmental standards, and recruiting and retaining top talent within the Company.

Financial Liquidity.   Improving financial flexibility and strengthening the balance sheet are also key components of Ultra’s business philosophy.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of $17.0 million and outstanding debt of $2.2 billion.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had borrowing base capacity of $325.0 million under its revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to the borrowing base redetermination, of which $104.0 million was outstanding. Further, the Company seeks to improve its cash flow visibility by hedging a portion of its forecasted volumes on an annual basis in order to manage commodity price risks and provide cash flow predictability.
 Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company reaffirmed its borrowing base at $1.3 billion, providing for $325.0 million of availability, and also entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility providing expansion of its allowed leverage metric, as well as other enhancements to the utility of the facility.  The next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for the fall of 2019.  This proactive effort is one of several steps towards building in time to execute the Company’s business plan and leverages the benefit from the December 2018 Exchange Transaction described below.  
 In December 2018, the Company exchanged (i) $505 million aggregate principal amount, or 72.1%, of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) and (ii) $275 million aggregate principal amount, or 55%, of the 7.125% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes” and, together with the 2022 Notes, the “Unsecured Notes”) of Ultra Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ultra Resources”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company for (a) $545.0 million aggregate principal amount of new 9.00% Cash/2.00% PIK Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due July 2024 of Ultra Resources (the “Second Lien Notes”) and (b) an aggregate of 10,919,499 new warrants of the Company entitling the holder thereof to purchase one common share of the Company (each a “Warrant” and collectively, the “Warrants”) (such transaction, the “Exchange Transaction”). The Exchange Transaction reduced principal balance of the indebtedness by $235 million. Following the Exchange Transaction, the average debt maturity was extended to 5.1 years. The weighted average cost of debt prior to the Exchange Transaction was approximately 6.3% and increased to approximately 8% after the exchange. 
 See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a description of the Revolving Credit Facility and additional details regarding the Exchange Transaction.
 Following the Exchange Transaction, subsequent to December 31, 2018, and through the date of this filing, the Company has successfully exchanged an additional $44.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes for $27.0 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes, reducing indebtedness by $252.5 million (inclusive of the Exchange Transaction).  Under the indenture governing the Second Lien Notes, the Company was permitted to exchange up to approximately $55.0 million of 2022 Notes for Second Lien Notes at terms that are the same or more favorable to the Company than the terms of the Exchange Transaction. The Company continues to retain the ability under the indenture to further exchange approximately $10.4 million of the remaining 2022 Notes within one year of the Exchange Transaction. 
 Exploration and Production
 See Item 2. “Properties” for a description of our properties. 
 Green River Basin, Wyoming
 During 2018, the Company participated in the drilling and casing of 116 vertical and 19 horizontal wells operated by the Company and others in Wyoming and continued its drilling and completion efficiency on its operated wells. In line with the Company’s commitment to make its operations more efficient, the Company’s operated well costs for vertical wells declined from an annual average of $3.8 million per well during 2014 to an annual average of $3.2 million per well during 2018, and $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Company restored its primary vertical well development program. The reduction in costs is attributable to drilling efficiencies, such as pad drilling and simultaneous operations for drilling and completion activities, application of technology and service cost reductions. The Company operates 89% of its production in the Pinedale field.
  The horizontal well program in 2018 resulted in several successful wells; however, the majority of the horizontal program was marginally economic to uneconomic, causing the Company to suspend this program in the third quarter of 2018 in order to evaluate the results, including the application of advanced geologic and engineering analysis and detailed evaluation of the horizontal wells that had been developed.  Ultra has completed one additional horizontal well in early 2019 and will integrate the results from this well into its analysis on developing the horizontal program. 
 During 2019, the Company plans, based on the availability of capital, to continue developing its position in the Pinedale field, and will continue to target tight gas sands of the Lance Pool, predominately through the development of vertical wells. All of the Company’s drilling activity is conducted utilizing historical well performance, completion efficiency, and its extensive geological and geophysical data set. This data set is used to map the productive intervals, to refine areas of drilling focus, to identify areas for future extension of the Lance fairway with both vertical and horizontal wells, as well as to consider other deeper horizons that may be viable development candidates. 
 Utah
 During 2018, the Company did not drill any wells on the Uinta Basin properties, The Company sold all of its Utah oil and gas properties in September 2018.

Marketing and Pricing
 Overview
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Ultra derived its revenues from the sale of its natural gas and associated condensate produced from wells operated by the Company in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming, and from the sale of crude oil and natural gas from wells operated by the Company in the Uinta Basin in Utah.  In September 2018, the Company divested its properties on the Uinta Basin in Utah. 
 During 2018, 95% of the Company’s production and 81% of its revenues were attributable to natural gas, with the balance attributable to associated condensate and crude oil. In the fourth quarter of 2018, subsequent to the sale of its Utah assets, 96% of Ultra’s production and 89% of its revenue were from the sale of natural gas.
 The Company’s natural gas and oil revenues are determined by prevailing market prices in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, specifically, southwest Wyoming as virtually all of its natural gas sold at the Inside FERC First of Month Index for Northwest Pipeline — Rocky Mountains (“NwRox”) is the price that is reflective of the Company’s gas sold in the Opal, Wyoming area. The NwRox and New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) is the price that is reflective of the Company’s gas sold in the Opal, Wyoming area.
 The NwRox can be volatile from time to time, particularly in peak winter and summer periods, as evidenced in November and December 2018 when natural gas at that delivery point was selling for $0.05 and $0.98, respectively, per MMBtu above NYMEX pricing for natural gas.  We also use derivative instruments in the management of the cash flows of our business, as discussed below.
 Natural Gas Marketing
 Ultra currently sells all its natural gas production to a diverse group of third-party, non-affiliated entities in a portfolio of transactions of various durations and prices (daily, monthly and longer term). The Company’s customer base includes a significant number of customers situated in the various regions of the United States. The sale of the Company’s natural gas is “as produced”. 
 Midstream services.    For its natural gas production in Wyoming, the Company has entered into various gathering and processing agreements with midstream service providers that gather, compress and process natural gas owned or controlled by the Company from its producing wells in the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah fields. Under these agreements, the midstream service providers continue to maintain and upgrade their facilities in southwest Wyoming to ensure reliability and certainty of operations. The Company believes that the capacity of the midstream infrastructure related to its production will continue to be adequate to allow it to sell all its available natural gas production.
 Basis differentials.    The market price for natural gas is influenced by a number of regional and national factors which are beyond the Company’s ability to control. These factors include, among others, weather in the western United States, natural gas supplies, imports from Canada, natural gas demand, inventory levels in natural gas storage fields, and natural gas pipeline capacity to export gas from the basins where the Company’s production is located. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information about risks to our financial condition and business results associated with basis differentials.
 The Rocky Mountain region is a net exporter of natural gas because local natural gas production exceeds local demand, especially during non-winter months. As a result, natural gas production in southwest Wyoming has from time to time sold at a discount relative to other U.S. natural gas production sources or market areas. These regional pricing differentials, or discounts, are typically referred to as “basis” or “basis differentials” and are reflective, to some extent, of (i) the costs associated with transporting the Company’s gas to markets in other regions or states, and (ii) the availability of pipeline capacity to move the Company’s gas to market.
 Since the completion of the Rockies Express and Ruby pipelines, the average annual basis for NwRox averaged 5.6% below Henry Hub from 2012 through 2016. The additional capacity of these two pipelines has had a significant positive impact on the value that the Company receives for its natural gas production in southwest Wyoming, as compared to prior years when constraints were prevalent in the region. However, during 2017 and 2018, NwRox basis has weakened from levels realized in 2012 through 2016 mainly due to weakening fundamentals in the Company’s core delivery area, California, and increasing flows from regions that produce significant quantities of oil and are connected by gas pipelines to the California market. In 2017 and 2018, NwRox basis averaged an 11.5% and 14.4%, respectively, discount to Henry Hub. This expansion in the percentage differential is due to lower absolute natural gas prices as well as significant competition for markets due to robust natural gas production in constrained areas such as the Permian and Delaware Basins in Texas, the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the Utica Shale in Ohio.  The average basis differential of NwRox was $0.36 and $0.44 below the Henry Hub in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
 While trades indicate that the basis differentials for the forward-looking basis market for 2019 and 2020 are negative to Henry Hub by approximately $0.30 and $0.46, respectively, there is expected improvement in NwRox basis beginning in 2020 as pipeline expansions and processing capacity in the Permian and Delaware Basins increase as well as processing and export capacity from the Houston and Beaumont areas.  The increased take-away capacity in these regions may improve the NwRox basis as competition for gas flowing into the mid-continent region and the West Coast are redirected to more local markets.

Oil Marketing
 Wyoming.    The Company markets its Wyoming condensate to various purchasers, which are primarily refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The Company’s condensate realized pricing is typically based on New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures daily settlement prices, adjusted for a negotiated location/transportation differential. All of the Company’s condensate sales are denominated in U.S. dollars per barrel and are paid monthly. The Company routinely maintains only operating inventories of condensate production and sells its product on an “as produced” basis. A portion of the Company’s condensate sales are entered into by its operating partners in the Pinedale field. Over 94% of oil is transported via pipeline, thereby greatly reducing the risk of spills and losses. During 2018, the Company realized a positive differential of $1.84, excluding anomalies for pipeline outages, to a West Texas Intermediate price. The improvement in the differential was a result of strong refining demand for the quality of condensate produced in the Pinedale area. This trend of strengthening oil differentials is expected to continue in 2019, as evidence by the contracts in place through 2019 at a positive differential of $3.23 per Bbl. 
 Utah.    Prior to the Company’s sale of its Uinta Basin properties in September 2018, such properties produced what is typically referred to as Black Wax Crude, considered a medium grade of crude oil. This oil was marketed through short-term or long-term contracts with refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The price for the Company’s crude oil production was typically based off of NYMEX pricing for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil or from a posting for Black Wax Crude in the Uinta Basin, less a negotiated location/transportation discount or differential. 
Derivatives
 The Company, from time to time and in the regular course of its business, enters into hedges for volumes equivalent to a portion of expected future production volumes, primarily through the use of financial swaps, collars and puts with creditworthy financial counterparties (See Note 8), or through the use of fixed price, forward sales of physical product. The Company’s Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to hedge 65% of forecast proved producing natural gas production, based on its most recent reserve report for 18 months from the end of the given quarter.  This requirement is in effect through September 30, 2019.  After that time, the requirement decreases to 50% of the estimated proved producing forecast for natural gas through March 31, 2020.  This means the Company may unwind hedges after September 30, 2019 at its discretion, provided the Company remains hedged at the 50% level for natural gas.  Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility limits the amount of hedging to 85% of forecast production for all products within a given quarter.  The Company plans to enter into additional hedge positions in much the same manner as it has done previously. See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”.
 The Company considers the requirements of the Revolving Credit Facility when developing its hedging policy.  The Company’s management and board of directors has a Hedge Committee that reviews the forecast production, the requirements under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the market outlook to determine the timing and the manner in which to hedge with the underlying goal to provide a level of cash flow predictivity while preserving some flexibility to participate in upward price movements.
 Significant Counterparties
 A significant counterparty is defined as one that individually accounts for 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during the year. In 2018, the Company had no single counterparty that represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company maintains credit policies intended to mitigate the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable related to the sale of natural gas and condensate as well as commodity derivatives. A more complete description of the Company’s credit policies is described in Note 13. The Company takes measures to ensure collectability with its purchasers through regular credit monitoring and reviews.  As necessary, the Company requires prepayment, letters of credit or parental guarantees from its purchasers for the periods of exposure.  The Company did not have any outstanding, uncollectible accounts for its natural gas and oil sales at December 31, 2018.
Regulatory Matters
 The Company’s oil and gas operations are subject to a number of regulations. Governing agencies may include one or more of the following levels: federal, regional, state, county, municipality, Tribal or other public entities. In general, the purposes of these regulations are to prevent waste of oil and natural gas resources, protect the rights of surface and mineral owners, regulate interstate transportation of oil and gas, and to govern environmental quality. Common forms of regulations may include:

• | Notification to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nondiscrimination statutes;
--+----------------------------


• | Royalty and related valuation requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | On-site security and bonding requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Location and density of drilling;
--+----------------------------------


• | Method of drilling, completing and operating wells;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Measurement and reporting of oil and gas;
--+------------------------------------------


• | Rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and gas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Production, severance and ad valorem taxes;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Management of produced water and waste; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Surface use, reclamation and plugging and abandonment of wells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 A significant portion of the Company’s operations are located on federal lands in the Pinedale and Jonah Fields of Sublette County, Wyoming. The development activities in these fields are subject to the regulation of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) which is responsible for governing their surface and mineral rights and regulating certain development activities in these fields. As required under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) was prepared to quantify and address potential impacts of natural gas development in both the Pinedale and Jonah fields. In March 2006, the BLM issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) which provides broad authorization for the development activities currently occurring in the Jonah Area. In September 2008, the BLM issued its ROD that currently governs the development activities in the Pinedale Area. In addition to the overarching authorizations provided by the Jonah and Pinedale RODs, BLM issues site-specific authorizations such as rights of way and permits to drill on an ongoing basis.
 The Pinedale ROD includes some significant components to ensure the orderly and responsible development of natural gas concurrent to minimizing the environmental impact. Some of these components include:
  
• | Year-round operations on multi-wells pads;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Liquid gathering systems to reduce truck traffic and minimize impacts to air quality and wildlife;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring of key wildlife species and mitigation of monitored impacts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced emission reductions including best practices such as controlled drill rigs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spatial progression of development to address specific surface and wildlife issues;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual meeting and long-range planning requirements to allow for socioeconomic predictability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Management to consider current and changing conditions and facilitate common-sense solutions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suspension of flank acreage until core acreage is developed and returned to a functioning habitat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the majority of the Company’s operations in Wyoming are covered by the Pinedale ROD, provisions of the Jonah ROD similarly ensure responsible and orderly development of the Jonah field while minimizing the environmental impact:
  
• | Annual reporting and long-range planning requirements to allow for planned mitigation and socioeconomic predictability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emission reduction report to ensure air quality goals are met;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual water well monitoring reports; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Flareless-completion technology to reduce noise, visual impacts and air emissions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The State of Wyoming maintains governance over some of the more traditional state-regulated matters such as individual well drilling permits, spacing and pooling, wellbore construction, as well as its own regulations on safety and environmental matters. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”) has authorized drilling density up to one well per five acres in the Pinedale field and up to one well per ten acres in the Jonah field.
 Regulations are well documented and the Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with current applicable laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company. However, changes to certain existing regulations are beyond the control of the Company and could introduce uncertainty and additional costs. See Item1A “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding environmental regulations.
 In December 2018 and January 2019, a portion of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to pass a continuing resolution.  This shut-down included all nonessential personnel at the BLM, including BLM staff tasked with processing drilling permits and sundries.  The Company has adequate inventory of approved applications for permit to drill to implement our 2019 drilling schedule, but any changes or deviations from what is approved in these permits cannot be approved during a shut-down, should another one occur, thus creating a compliance risk.  In addition, such government disruptions could delay or halt the granting and renewal of the permits, approvals, and certificates required to conduct our operations.  The WOGCC continues to permit and oversee drilling operations. 
 Mineral Leasing Act
 The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (“Mineral Act”) prohibits ownership of any direct or indirect interest in federal onshore oil and gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign corporation except through stock ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and gas lease can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. The Company’s subsidiaries that own mineral leases qualify as a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory. Although the regulations promulgated and administered by the BLM pursuant to the Mineral Act provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. The Company owns interests in numerous federal onshore oil and gas leases. It is possible that holders of the Company’s equity interests may be citizens of foreign countries that are determined to be non-reciprocal countries under the Mineral Act. In such event, the federal onshore oil and gas leases held by the Company could be subject to cancellation based on such determination.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
 Surface Damage Acts
 Several states, including Wyoming, and some tribal nations have enacted surface damage statutes. These laws are designed to compensate for damages caused by oil and gas development operations. Most surface damage statutes contain entry and negotiation requirements to facilitate contact between the operator and surface owners. Most also contain binding requirements for payments by the operator in connection with development operations. Costs and delays associated with surface damage statutes could impair operational effectiveness and increase development costs.
Environmental Regulations
 General.    The Company’s exploration, drilling and production activities from wells and oil and natural gas facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating or storing oil, natural gas and other products are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality, including those relating to oil spills and pollution control. These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2017-2019 and as a general matter, the oil and gas exploration and production industry has been and continues to be the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot be sure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. However, it is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste.    The Company has previously owned or leased and currently owns or leases, numerous properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although the Company utilized standard operating and disposal practices, hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties are or have been operated by third parties over whom the Company has no control, nor has ever had control as to such entities’ treatment of hydrocarbons or other wastes or the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. Under current and evolving law, it is possible the Company could be required to remediate property, including ground water, impacted by operations of the Company or by such third-party operators, or impacted by previously disposed wastes including performing remedial plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing contamination.
 Although oil and gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes (“Hazardous Wastes”) under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and some comparable state statutes, it is possible some wastes the Company generates presently are or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA and state analogs, even as non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for certain wastes, including Hazardous Wastes and there is no guarantee that the EPA or the states will not adopt more stringent requirements in the future. For example, in May 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that sought to compel the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise its regulations regarding existing exemptions for exploration and production related wastes. Pursuant to a consent decree entered December 28, 2016 that settled the lawsuit, the EPA committed to propose by March 15, 2019 new regulations for the management of oil and gas wastes under RCRA Subtitle D (which relates to non-hazardous wastes), or sign a determination that a revision of existing rules is unnecessary.  If the EPA proposes new rulemaking, the Consent Decree requires the EPA to take final action on such rules no later than July 15, 2021.  Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from designation as Hazardous Wastes may in the future be designated as Hazardous Wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 In addition, current and future regulations governing the handling and disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may affect our operations. For example, in Wyoming any waste material exceeding specified thresholds is subject to controls and guidance by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality Solid and Hazardous Waste Division, which determines how and where NORM wastes will be disposed of.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.    Many of the Company’s exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Congress has periodically considered legislation to amend the SDWA to remove the exemption from permitting and regulation provided to injection for hydraulic fracturing (except where diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid) and to require the disclosure and reporting of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. This type of federal legislation, if adopted, could lead to additional regulation and permitting requirements that could result in operational delays making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance and operating costs.
 In addition, the EPA has issued guidance regarding federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. Further, in December 2016 the EPA released its final report on a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing resources. While no widespread impacts from hydraulic fracturing were found, the EPA identified a number of activities and factors that may have increased risk for future impacts.  Furthermore, a number of public and private studies are underway regarding the connection, if any, between the disposal of waste water associated with hydraulic fracturing and observed seismicity in the vicinity of such disposal operations. These studies and the EPA’s enforcement initiative for the energy extraction sector could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.

In addition, some states, including Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals in the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or well stimulation operations. Additionally, some states, localities and local regulatory districts have adopted or have considered adopting regulations to limit, and in some case impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding permitting, casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Although none of the Company’s properties are in jurisdictions where the moratoria have been imposed, it is possible the jurisdictions where the Company’s properties are located may adopt such limits or other limits on hydraulic fracturing in the future. In December 2017, BLM rescinded regulations that it previously enacted for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands; that rescission has been challenged by several environmental groups and states in ongoing litigation. Further, the EPA has announced an initiative under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and is working on regulations for wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing.
 Finally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of waste has been alleged to cause earthquakes.  In Oklahoma, for example, such issues have led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity.  Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells.  Although our operations are not located in those jurisdictions, any future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection in jurisdictions where we operate could affect our operations.
 Superfund.    Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, liability, generally, is joint and several for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (“Hazardous Substances”). These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), include current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance, persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility, and in some cases the parties transporting such Hazardous Substances to the facility at issue. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases and threats of releases to protect the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRP the costs of such action. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of Hazardous Substance, in the course of its operations, adulterated petroleum products containing other Hazardous Substances have been treated as Hazardous Substances in the past, and the Company has generated and will generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of Hazardous Substances. The Company may also be an owner or operator of facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released. The Company may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages, as a past or present owner or operator or as an arranger. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Many states have comparable laws imposing liability on similar classes of persons for releases, including for releases of materials that may not be included in CERCLA’s definition of Hazardous Substances. To its knowledge, the Company has not been named a PRP under CERCLA (or any comparable state law) nor have any prior owners or operators of its properties been named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such property.
 National Environmental Policy Act.    The federal National Environmental Policy Act provides that, for federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the federal agency taking such action must prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) or an environmental impact statement (“EIS”). In the EIS, the agency is required to evaluate alternatives to the proposed action and the environmental impacts of the proposed action and of such alternatives. Actions of the Company, such as drilling on federal lands, to the extent the drilling requires federal approval, may trigger the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, including the requirement that an EA or EIS be prepared. The requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act may result in increased costs, significant delays and the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company’s activities, including but not limited to the restricting or prohibiting of drilling.
 Oil Pollution Act.    The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns liability, which generally is joint and several, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and for a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses and limitations exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, the Company could be liable for costs and damages.

Clean Air Act.    The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) regulates emissions of six criteria pollutants from stationary and mobile sources and establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for the pollutants of concern. The CAA is a federal law, but states, tribes and local governments do much of the work to develop EPA-approved plans to achieve these standards and meet the CAA’s requirements. Federal and state laws generally require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction, which may require, among other things, stringent emission controls. Administrative agencies can bring actions for failure to comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, which may result in fines, injunctive relief and imprisonment.
 The New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs under the CAA impose specific requirements affecting the oil and gas industry under both programs for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, completions and certain other equipment. Periodic review and revision of these rules by federal and state agencies may require changes to our operations, including possible installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business.
 In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector; however, in September 2018, under a new administration, the EPA proposed amendments that would relax requirements of the rules. Similarly, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of regulations it had previously enacted to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands; California and New Mexico have challenged the new rule in ongoing litigation.  In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending. Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements and cause major delays in construction, effectively depressing new development. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development, which could be significant.
 Clean Water Act.    The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Under the Clean Water Act, permits must be obtained for the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The CWA provides for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants and of oil and hazardous substances. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities.
 The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit. In September 2015, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) issued new rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction over wetlands (the “Clean Water Rule”). The Clean Water Rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule lies with the federal district courts, and the Sixth Circuit’s stay was dissolved in February 2018. On July 27, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to rescind the Clean Water Rule and re-codify the regulatory text that existed prior to 2015 defining the “waters of the United States,” for which the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Army established a non-regulatory docket to solicit written recommendations for the rulemaking, which closed on November 28, 2017. On February 6, 2018, the EPA and the Corps finalized a two-year postponement of the effective date of the Clean Water Rule to February 6, 2020. On August 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued a nationwide injunction against EPA’s and the Corps’ postponement of the Clean Water Rule, making the rule effective in 26 states, certain of which have asked the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas to postpone the rule nationwide. To the extent the Clean Water Rule is enforced in jurisdictions in which we operate or a replacement rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.  In December 2018, EPA released revisions to the definition of WOTUS, specifically excluding “ephemeral” features that exist only during precipitation events and removing any groundwater features. These revisions are anticipated for finalization in 2019. Until that time, regulations are being implemented as they were prior to August 2015.
 Also, in 2016, the EPA finalized new wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works, permitting several years until compliance will be enforced. This pending restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.

Endangered Species Act.    The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and special protections are provided to bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Company conducts operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases that have species, such as raptors, that are listed and species, such as sage grouse, that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA.  In the case of sage grouse, in October 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the beginning of a scoping process to solicit public comments on Greater Sage-Grouse land management that could warrant land plan use amendments relating to the sage grouse. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary for over 250 species.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a 7-Year National Listing Workplan in September 2016. However, on July 25, 2018, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed three revisions to regulations regarding critical habitat designation, interagency cooperation, and protection of threatened species that it believes are necessary to address industry and landowner concerns. The U.S. Department of the Interior also issued an opinion on December 22, 2017 that would narrow certain protections afforded to migratory birds pursuant to the MBTA. In response to this opinion, two separate lawsuits were filed on May 24, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the Department of the Interior’s interpretation of the MBTA. On September 5, 2018, eight states also filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on the relevant issue. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
 Climate Change Legislation.    More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), including methane and carbon dioxide, may be adopted and could cause the Company to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions.  Although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements as applicable to GHG emissions, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA has established GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. The Company has submitted all required annual reports to date. Although the rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it could require us to incur significant costs to monitor, keep records of, and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.
 In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. Cap and trade programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States was one of 175 countries to sign an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that requires member countries to set their own GHG emission reduction goals beginning in 2020. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and on August 4, 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as of November 4, 2020 unless the agreement is renegotiated. Various states and local governments have vowed to continue to enact regulations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
 Any legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.  Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced by our customers or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
 Worker Safety.    The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and analogous state laws regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. For example, under a new OSHA standard limiting respirable silica exposure, the oil and gas industry must implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. In December 2015, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Labor announced a plan to more frequently and effectively prosecute worker health and safety violations, including enhanced penalties.
 The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 151 full-time employees, including officers. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is satisfactory.
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 
 Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the drilling and producing activities and other operations in the areas in which the Company operates.  These seasonal conditions can pose challenges for meeting the well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.  For example, the Company’s operations may be impacted by ice and snow in the winter and by electrical storms and high temperatures in the spring and summer, as well as by wild fires in the fall.
 The demand for natural gas typically decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months.  Seasonal anomalies sometimes lessen this fluctuation.  In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.  As a corollary, the demand for our products can be impacted by weather in the western United States from temperature fluctuations outside of normal ranges, moisture levels in the Pacific Northwest to the extent it impacts hydroelectric power generation, and more broadly across the United States when there are unusual cold events or lack of winter weather.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies in our industry that have more extensive resources than we do or that may have other competitive advantages or disadvantages.  We compete with other companies in the acquisition of properties, in the search for and development of reserves, in the production and sale of natural gas and crude oil, and for the labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.  Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies, and individual producers and operators.
Principal Executive Offices
 The Company is incorporated under the laws of Yukon, Canada, with headquarters in Englewood, Colorado.  The principal executive offices are located at 116 Inverness Drive East, Suite 400, Englewood, Colorado.  The main telephone number is (303) 708-9740.
