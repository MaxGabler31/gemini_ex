Item 1. Business 
Overview
We are a medical technology company primarily focusing on telemedicine solutions that enable the detection and monitoring of cardiac disease outside a healthcare facility setting. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote diagnostic and monitoring technologies that can be used for patients anywhere, with initial offerings for ambulatory and emergency department use. Our products require Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance and have not been cleared for marketing (hereinafter “Product” or “Products”.) We believe our Products and services will benefit many stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare payors. Our initial focus is providing diagnostic data to help physicians with care management of patients with cardiovascular disease. There are two major markets for our initial Products: remote patient monitoring and the hospital Emergency Department (“ED”). We are developing our telehealth Product to address the rapidly growing field of remote patient monitoring. Our telehealth Product is comprised of a credit card sized Electrocardiogram (“ECG”) machine and a powerful cloud-based diagnostic software expert system. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to play a central role in remote monitoring of high-risk coronary artery disease patients, because the studies performed so far have shown that our ischemia detection system is highly accurate. Our powerful ischemia detection system is unlike other ambulatory cardiac monitors currently on the market which focus on arrhythmia detection. Also, we are applying our platform technology to create a software tool for detecting heart attacks in the ED environment. This software tool is designed to enable emergency physicians to more accurately and quickly diagnose heart attacks than currently available. Market release of this Product will precede that of the telehealth Product.
To date, we have developed working prototypes for both our telehealth Product and our ED Product. The ED Product is currently undergoing additional engineering work that we believe will make it ready for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. Both Products have been validated in three medical studies, which were designed by Harvard Medical School faculty. Peer reviewed publications that describe the studies and results are in preparation. One peer reviewed medical publication submission is planned for the second quarter of 2022 and followed by another one later in 2022. These two publications will describe results of our two key studies: HeartBeam Ischemia Detection Study (“HIDES”) and B Score. In 2022 we plan to publish results of a study on performance of our ED Product in the real-life environment of an ED. In November 2021 we presented a technology abstract at the IEEE EMBS 2021 Conference. The abstract describes the technology foundation of our ED Product.
The custom software and hardware of our Products, we believe, are classified as Class II medical devices by the FDA running on an FDA approved Class I registered platform. Class II medical devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient histories and FDA guidance documents. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket notification process.
HeartBeam has three issued U.S. patents (U.S.10,433,744, U.S.10,117,592 and U.S.11,071,490), and six pending U.S applications. Three of the pending applications have published, all of the remaining three pending cases are unpublished. Outside of the U.S., HeartBeam has three pending European (“EU”) utility patent applications (one of which is allowed), one pending Canadian (“CA”) utility patent application, one pending Chinese (“CN”) utility patent application, one pending Japanese (“JP”) utility patent application, one pending Australian (“AU”) application, and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications. 
Market Overview
Chronic diseases are the number one burden on the healthcare system, driving up costs each year, and cardiovascular illnesses are one of the top contributors. Regulators, payors and providers are focused on shifting the diagnosis and management of these conditions to drive better outcomes at lower cost. Connected medical solutions are expanding rapidly and are projected to reach $155 billion by 2026, a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17%. These solutions are socio-technical models for healthcare management and delivery using technology to provide healthcare services remotely and aim to maximize healthcare resources and provide increased, flexible opportunities for consumers to engage with clinicians and better self-manage their care, using readily available consumer technologies to deliver patient care outside of the hospital or doctor’s office. The types of companies that make up this market include Accenture, IBM, SAP, GE 
Healthcare, Oracle, Microsoft, Airstrip Technology, Medtronic, Allscripts, Boston Scientific, Athenahealth, Cerner, Philips, Agamatrix, Qualcomm, and AliveCor.
The market for remote patient monitoring (“RPM”), is projected to reach $31.3 billion by 2023. In 2019, 1,800 hospitals in the US were using mobile applications to improve risk management and quality of care. We believe the number in 2020 was likely larger as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated use and acceptance of telehealth by both patients and healthcare providers.
Cardiovascular disease is the number one cost to the healthcare system and is estimated to be responsible for 1 in every 6 healthcare dollars spent in the US. As cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, early detection, diagnosis, and management of chronic cardiac conditions are necessary to relieve the increasing burden on the healthcare infrastructure. Diagnostic tests such as ECGs are used to detect, diagnose and track numerous cardiovascular conditions. With advances in mobile communications, diagnostic monitoring of cardiac conditions is increasingly occurring outside the hospital. We believe that the trend of moving diagnostic data collection and care for heart disease to the ambulatory setting is a permanent change. This trend will continue to place increased value on cost-effective diagnostic and monitoring technologies in the ECG market.
Time to intervention is one the key factors that influence medical outcome for a patient that is experiencing a heart attack. Yet, for a number of reasons, on average, a heart attack patient will wait about three hours before seeking help. That has very negative consequences on mortality rate for these patients as well as a marked increase in the heart failure incidence in these patients. The huge increase in healthcare expenditures associated with that delay in seeking medical help is responsible for relative increase in heart failure rate of 8.7% for every 30 minutes of delay. Heart failure is one of the most expensive diagnoses to treat.
Our initial telemedicine technology Product will address the heart attack detection market as well as the market to monitor Coronary Artery Disease (“CAD”) patients who are typically at high risk for a heart attack. Currently there are no products on the market that are user friendly, easy to carry, and always with the patient in order to provide physicians and patients with timely and highly accurate information about potential Acute Coronary Syndrome (“ACS”) and Myocardial Infarction (“MI”) events. A tool that is always with the patient, that decreases time to intervention, and that decreases the number of unnecessary ED visits by chest pain patients would have a significant effect on saving lives and healthcare dollars. We believe our technology will address this problem and will provide a convenient, cost-effective, integrated telehealth solution, including software and hardware for physicians and their patients. There are approximately 18 million people in 
the US who are considered at high risk for a heart attack, including 8 million who already have had prior intervention for MI’s and are therefore considered to be at extreme risk.
In the US, mobile cardiac tests are primarily conducted through outsourced Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (“IDTFs”) or as part of a RPM system. Reimbursement rates vary depending on the use case and generally are based on the value a technology offers to patients and healthcare providers. Actual reimbursed pricing is set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Reimbursement rates for private insurers typically provide for similar or better reimbursement rates when compared to those set by the Government for Medicare and Medicaid.
In the ED environment, early and accurate diagnosis of a chest pain patient who is potentially having a heart attack is of immense importance. Guidelines state that every chest pain patient in an ED must receive an ECG within 10 minutes of presentation. The interpretation accuracy of these initial ECGs is only approximately 66%. The need for increased ECG accuracy in detecting a heart attack in the ED is well defined, and an improved solution could result in saved lives and healthcare dollars. We are currently developing a version of our ED Product that will be hosted by LIVMOR, Inc., a digital health solutions company (“LIVMOR”) on a white label version of its FDA Class 1 registered platform. Our ED Product is being developed to meet all requirements for FDA 510(k) clearance submission and we plan to submit this Product for FDA clearance during the second quarter of 2022. We believe this Product will offer a marked increase in the accuracy of heart attack detection in EDs. There are approximately 5,000 ED departments in the US and 137 million ED visits per year.
Products and Technology
The foundation of our novel technology is the concept of vectorcardiography (“VCG”), a technology that has long been seen as superior to ECGs in detecting MIs, but is no longer used clinically because of the difficulty experienced by physicians interpreting the output. We solved the crucial problem of recording three orthogonal (x, y and z) projections of the heart vector with a device that is sized like a credit card. The thickness of our credit card sized ECG signal collection device is about 1/8 inch (3 mm) and it weighs about 1 ounce (28 grams).
The core technology consists of a series of patented inventions and associated algorithms. In addition to using VCG to get a more complete 3D characterization of cardiac activity, we use the concept of a baseline. Our MI detection marker is a differential marker that measures the change in cardiac parameters between an asymptomatic (baseline) recording and the symptomatic recording. It is personalized for every patient as every patient has a unique baseline. Our increase in diagnostic performance in detecting MIs, when compared to a panel of cardiologists, is attributed to a richer cardiac information set offered by VCG and the fact that our MI marker compares the baseline and symptomatic recordings and does that in the 3D space of VCG.
This novel technology has resulted in two key Products to date: a telehealth Product for high-risk cardiovascular patients and a powerful cloud-based diagnostic expert and MI detection system for EDs. Our telehealth ECG collection device is the size of a credit card and records cardiac signals with integrated electrodes rather than wires or self-adhesive electrodes. Unlike a standard 12-lead ECG machine that records signals in empirically determined locations on a human body, our approach is focused on recording three projections of the heart vector. The successful recording of the projections of the heart vector enables the synthesis of a 12-lead signal set as well as internal algorithmic diagnostic work in the space of 3D heart vectors.
There are obvious ease of use advantages when comparing our handheld device that fits in a wallet and can be instantly self-applied versus the current 12-lead ECG machine that requires a trained professional to apply. In addition, there are diagnostic performance advantages, including, based on our initial study, increased accuracy in diagnosing MIs. The system is used by patients at home or elsewhere, with help from their physicians, to assess whether their chest pain is truly the result of an MI.
Our telehealth system will be a prescription-only mobile health system intended for individuals with known or suspected heart disease, especially CAD. It helps guide physicians in choosing the best course of action for their patients who experience chest pain outside of a medical facility. Our system will bring a medical grade ECG to patients and will enable them to receive a plan of action from a physician in a timely manner. At the time of onboarding and at regularly scheduled time intervals, patients record a baseline 30 second cardiac reading using our device. When a patient experiences symptoms, such as irregular heartbeats or chest pain, the patient can simply open the smartphone app and press the credit card sized device against the chest to collect signals that can be converted to a synthesized 12-lead ECG. This derived 12-lead ECG is sent to the physician overlayed with the patient’s derived baseline ECG recording. In addition, the patient provides input on their symptoms that are sent, along with the ECG data, to the cloud for interpretation. A cloud-based algorithm processes the signals and displays the symptom description and patient history to a physician to analyze and prescribe an action plan. From start to finish, the process takes just a few minutes.
The telehealth system consists of:
1.A credit card sized cardiac electrical signal collection device. The device captures cardiac signals that represent x, y and z projections of the heart vector and transmits them via Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. It is always with the patient as it easily fits in a wallet. It is easy to use as all that is required of the patient is that the device be pressed against the chest.
2.A smartphone application that receives the cardiac signals from the HeartBeam signal collection device. The app has several functions: guiding the patient through the signal collection, asking about symptoms, displaying the status of the data collection, and notifying the patient of the plan of action as determined by a physician. In addition, the app will contain HIPAA-compliant video conferencing or text capabilities for the healthcare provider to communicate directly with the patient.
3.A cloud-based software system that serves three basic functions: (1) Performing a final check of the ECG signal quality, (2) Synthesizing a 12-lead ECG from the measured (recorded) 3 vector leads, and (3) Preparing a summary report for the physician. In order to facilitate a more accurate physician interpretation of the data, the software overlays the patient’s synthesized baseline 12 lead ECG waveform on the synthesized 12 lead ECG waveform from the current event. To ensure high signal quality, the system checks for noise levels in the recorded signals. Those signals that can be effectively filtered are accepted and those that have a noise level above an empirically established threshold are rejected. If a recorded signal is rejected, the user is asked to repeat the recording. 
4.A web-based physician portal, which displays all of the relevant information for the physician to analyze: patient history, symptoms, baseline and current readings, synthesized 12 lead ECG, and recorded 3 vector leads. The HeartBeam physician portal assists physicians with their diagnostic interpretation by providing both the baseline 12-lead synthesized ECG and the 12-lead synthesized ECG that is under evaluation.
The market release of our telehealth Product will be in two generations. The Generation 1 product will have a limited feature set and will offer to the physician a pair of baseline and symptomatic ECGs and a symptoms report. This product is an excellent match for existing current procedural terminology (CPT) remote patient monitoring reimbursement codes. The Generation 2 product will feature our proprietary MI marker as well as our diagnostic suggestion in addition to all features of Generation 1 product. Since Generation 2 will offer increased medical value, we plan to seek a unique reimbursement code for this product.
The same core technology is used in the ED Product. In this application, the increased accuracy of detecting MIs by the ECG is of utmost importance. An ECG is the first diagnostic test a chest pain patient receives in the ED and it has a major impact on the patient’s subsequent clinical path. The ED Product has no hardware and introduces minimal change to the standard of care chest pain diagnostic path. It uses a baseline standard 12-lead ECG from the patient’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and the chest pain ECG that is being evaluated. It converts both of them to a VCG representation and utilizes our proprietary 3D VCG differential marker. An initial clinical study indicates that the ED software Product offers considerable improvement in the accuracy of MI detection compared to a panel of experienced cardiologists interpreting a standard 12 lead ECG. The importance of increased accuracy of the first ECG interpretation for a chest pain patient presenting to an ED is significant, potentially leading to faster intervention or avoiding unnecessary activation of the cardiac catheterization lab.
FDA Regulatory Path
We have defined the FDA 510(k) clearance paths for both Products and have contracted with regulatory consultants to help us clear both products with the FDA. 
Two predicate devices were identified that combined, we believe, will be acceptable to the FDA for our telehealth Generation 1 Product submission. The submission is planned to contain results of a validation study. The nature of this study will be a comparison of our synthesized 12-lead ECG recordings to standard 12-lead ECG recordings and to the synthesized ECG recordings from one of the predicate devices. We plan to submit our Generation 1 telehealth product to the FDA for a 510(k) clearance in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
The ED software product is hosted on a white label version of LIVMOR’s Class I registered software platform and a predicate device for the cloud-based diagnostic engine for the ED product was identified. It is widely used as it is part of a software package that one of the leading ECG machine manufacturers offers. The predicate device software makes a diagnostic suggestion in regard to a potential MI diagnosis. Our ED software Product will also make a diagnostic suggestion to the ED physician. In our HIDES study we have shown superiority in detecting ischemia (ACS) over a panel of cardiologists. The study that will be used for the FDA 510(k) clearance application will be a retrospective study of patient's electronic medical records that contain the patient's chest pain ECGs at the presentation to the ED and their baseline asymptomatic ECG recordings. The diagnostic suggestion of the predicate device software, which is already contained in the EMR, will be compared to the diagnostic suggestion of our Product. We plan to submit our ED Product for FDA 510(k) clearance in the second quarter of 2022.
Market Opportunity
ECGs are key diagnostic tests utilized in the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. In the US in 2016, there were 121.5 million adults living with cardiovascular disease and 18.3 million adults with diagnosed coronary artery disease. The market size is increasing, due to an aging population and lifestyle choices.
Every 40 seconds someone in the US has a heart attack, or MI. Unfortunately, there is no way for patients to tell whether the symptoms they are experiencing are due to an MI, or some other more benign condition such as indigestion. As a result, patients often ignore symptoms and delay seeking care, which leads to worse outcomes and increased mortality. On the other hand, many patients who go to the ED with chest pain are not experiencing an MI. Chest pain is the second most 
common reason for an ED visit, yet fewer than 20% of chest pain ED visits result in a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition. These unnecessary ED visits lead to well over $10 billion in unnecessary healthcare expenditures.
Most ECGs are conducted in a healthcare facility setting using a 12-lead ECG machine, the gold standard. ECGs taken outside of healthcare facilities are expected to grow more quickly than in-hospital ECGs. Monitoring cardiac patients outside of a hospital is a fast growing trend, as it is less expensive and provides a better patient experience. However, while ambulatory cardiac monitoring devices are often much easier for patients to use, they have fewer leads than the gold standard and therefore cannot offer as comprehensive a picture of cardiac health.
While a standard 12-lead ECG readout is of great medical value, it is simply impractical to have a machine next to patients when they experience symptoms outside the clinical setting, since recording the event requires attaching multiple electrodes to the patient’s body with professional assistance. While existing technologies use predominantly single lead ECG devices to monitor arrhythmias, these technologies do not provide information to the physician on the presence of life threatening conditions of ACS or heart attacks.
We believe our telehealth technology addresses these market needs and has several key attributes that make it a good fit for these patients. Our telehealth Product is generally used when symptoms occur and offers the potential for lifelong patient usage. The device is always near the patient and ready to be used for recording a cardiac event. It enables real-time cardiac data transmission during a telemedicine visit. It offers a recorded 3 vector lead set of signals and a 12-lead derived ECG set of signals. Physicians will typically prescribe our solution to chronic cardiovascular patients for long term monitoring, thereby enabling prolonged data collection and delivering a more complete picture for diagnosis. This will also enable the use of artificial intelligence on our future database that will have a unique set of longitudinal 12-lead ECGs for patients.
Market Strategy
Our goal is to establish our products as key solutions for cardiology practices and hospital EDs. Our efforts to enter the market involve establishing clinical evidence and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of adopting our products. For both the telehealth and the ED Products, the initial geographic market is the United States.
We believe that both the telehealth and EDs for our ED Product and Generation 1 telehealth Product. For the telehealth Product, the primary customers are cardiology practices and the cardiology departments of hospitals. Healthcare insurers are another important customer, as they will benefit from the reduced costs to the healthcare system. We are working to develop new clinical studies and publish results of completed clinical studies and plan to demonstrate real world cost-effectiveness of the use of the solution.
A key element of our strategy is obtaining reimbursement for the telehealth Product. This strategy has two stages in full alignment with our Generation 1 and Generation 2 telehealth product introduction plans. In the short term, we expect that physicians will use existing Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) reimbursement codes. We believe that our Generation 1 telehealth Product will be a compelling offering among RPM technologies, as it will be uniquely positioned to assess ACS and heart attacks among high-risk cardiac patients. In the longer term, we will conduct additional clinical trials that demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our next generation, full featured Generation 2 Product and will work to secure a new CPT code and reimbursement specific to the Generation 2 telehealth solution. RPM codes pay practices for providing covered services. 
The main RPM codes relevant for our Generation 1 telehealth Product are:
•CPT 99453: Remote monitoring of physiologic parameter(s), initial; set-up and patient education on use of equipment
•CPT 99454: Remote monitoring of physiologic parameter(s), initial; device(s) supply with daily recording(s) or programmed alert(s) transmission, each 30 days
•CPT 99457: Remote physiologic monitoring treatment management services, clinical staff/physician/ other qualified health care professional time in a calendar month requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the month; initial 20 minutes
•CPT 99458: Remote physiologic monitoring treatment management services, clinical staff/physician/ other qualified health care professional time in a calendar month requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the month; additional 20 minutes
CPT 99453 is paid one-time per patient, with the average CMS payment rate of $21. The technical code CPT 99454 and the professional code CPT 99457 are paid monthly, with a combined average CMS payment rate of $119. Private payers may pay at different amounts.
Practices will bill payers for monthly services related to the core HeartBeam telehealth Product, potentially bundled with a third-party blood pressure measurement device. Under this model, the company will negotiate with payers for a per patient per month fee for the ongoing HeartBeam telehealth service, which also will include an amortized charge for the cost of the device.
We will explore other business models. For example, hospitals face CMS penalties if their 30-day readmission rates for patients who are discharged after an MI exceed certain thresholds. These CMS penalties are levied on all hospital CMS payments, so the impact can be significant. Our telehealth Product can be a tool to help hospitals manage these patients after discharge. We will explore models in which hospitals pay for the device and for the initial 30 days of service. In addition, we will explore models for value-based care, in which the use of the telehealth Product reduces overall costs.
We have engaged two senior sales executives in Atlanta and Denver with extensive experience in medical device sales. We are currently speaking with hospitals in large healthcare systems to educate them about our first two products. These sales executives will be responsible for building a direct sales force for our telehealth Product and to target large hospitals and integrated practices. These are sophisticated customers, and we plan to use technical presentations, peer reviewed clinical data, and demonstration projects to achieve penetration of this market. We plan to continue to expand our medical advisory board, conduct clinical trials with leading cardiologists to increase the body of evidence, and establish reference sites among these customers.

Our long-term strategy is to generate sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness to generate reimbursement coverage and payment specifically for the HeartBeam telehealth Generation 2 solution. We expect to be able to demonstrate significant clinical benefits for patients and savings to the health care system, justifying reimbursement levels well in excess of the amount paid through the RPM pathway. 
For the telehealth Product, our primary marketing strategy will focus on the medical community with continued validation of clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness and the establishment of reference sites. We plan to also create educational materials and provide other support to help educate our customers’ patients. 
For the ED Product, the primary customers are acute care facilities. As with the telehealth Product, we plan to publish clinical studies on the effectiveness of the Product. In addition, we plan to develop financial models demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of the approach and establish reference sites who are using the Product. We do not expect to obtain specific reimbursement for the ED Product but intend to demonstrate that the purchase of the software would result in clinical and economic benefits and potentially reduced malpractice legal exposure for ED provider institutions.
We are establishing a direct sales network with relationships and experience selling to EDs. 
Clinical Data
HeartBeam has performed three clinical studies to assess performance of our technologies. 
1. HIDES — Included 66 patients whose coronary arteries were occluded during a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (“PCI”) and had electrical signals simultaneously collected by both a traditional 12-lead ECG and our vector signal-based device. 
ECG recordings:
66 baseline recordings for each patient were taken during patient enrollment and prior to the balloon inflation. These were ischemia negative recordings. 120 recordings were taken during balloon occlusions in various arteries. These were ischemia positive recordings. There were a total of 186 diagnostic recordings: 66 ischemia negative recordings and 120 ischemia positive recordings.
Study design:
The HeartBeam automated ischemia marker is based on the vector difference between ST vectors of the symptomatic and baseline recordings. Human reading results were obtained by averaging results from three expert readers (two electrophysiologists and one invasive cardiologist) who were presented with the 186 standard 12-lead ECG recordings. These readings were performed in two sessions four weeks apart. A total of six readings were averaged to arrive at human readers’ ischemia detection performance.
Study results:
The automated HeartBeam ischemia marker was superior to human expert reading for detecting acute ischemia (66 patients, 120 balloon occlusions; 186 total recordings) using ECG signals only:

 | SENSITIVITY [%] | SPECIFICITY [%] | ACCURACY [%]
Human readings | 71.94 | 70.96 | 71.59 
HeartBeam ischemia marker | 91.7 | 95.5 | 93 
 | p<0.01 | p<0.01 | p<0.01 

The ischemia marker showed an area under the curve (“AUC”) in the receiver operating characteristic (“ROC”) curve of 93.6%. HeartBeam’s marker accuracy was consistent all across the three culprit arteries (LAD, LCX, RCA), p=1.00. There was no statistically significant difference in accuracy between three human readers (p=1.00).
Synthetized vs, standard 12 lead ECG:
The synthesized 12 lead ECG was obtained using an individual transformation matrix obtained from standard 12 lead signals. Comparison of the standard 12 lead and synthetized 12 lead ECGs were performed with standard correlation analyses. Results for Pearson’s correlation coefficient R between standard 12 lead and synthetized 12 lead ECGs were:
P wave: R = 0.937; 
QRS complex: R = 0.994; 
T wave: R = 0.975
They are shown in the graphical form for all 186 pairs of signals (standard and synthesized 12-lead):
Pearson’s correlation coefficient is the test statistic that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables A value of 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship perfectly; value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables
2. B Score — Evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of the HeartBeam diagnostic algorithm in diagnosing patients with ACS in the ED setting.
Study design and enrollment:
Enrolled were all patients presenting to an ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ACS who a) answered questions about risk factors and chest pain characteristics and b) had standard 12-lead ECG and HeartBeam ECG recorded 3 times with 10-15 minutes intervals between recordings. The final decision whether a patient was having ACS was determined by 3 cardiology experts (gold standard panel) based on discharge diagnosis and one week follow up data. 
An additional HeartBeam ECG recording was taken between 9 and 12 months after the initial visit, when ST resolution was completed in the majority of cases, and this recording was used as the baseline ECG in HeartBeam’s diagnostic algorithm. The same set of data — risk factors, chest pain characteristics and three recordings — were both used for evaluation of the HeartBeam algorithm and presented to three expert cardiologists (evaluation panel) for a blinded evaluation.
Study results:
110 ER patients presenting with chest pain of which 29 (26%) with ACS (per gold standard panel), underwent HeartBeam assessment as well as assessment by the evaluation cardiologist panel. Sensitivity of the HeartBeam algorithm was 97% (27/28) and specificity was 56% (45/81). The only positive patient missed by the algorithm had known coronary disease with typical anginal episode resulting in a troponin leak. The average sensitivity and specificity of the evaluation cardiologists panel was 93% and 49%, respectively. The diagnostic performance of the HeartBeam algorithm in determining presence of the ACS in these patients was statistically indifferent from the performance of the evaluation cardiologist panel (p>0.42).
This result indicates that the quality of the advice produced by our expert system will be extremely valuable to the physician who is assessing the condition of a patient in a telehealth environment.
3. ISPEC — evaluation of the ECG signal quality and specificity of the ACS detection (false positive rate) in real-life use of the HeartBeam device by non-symptomatic patients.
Study design and enrollment:
The study included 30 participants, healthy volunteers and patients with different cardiac disturbances. The participants recorded three HeartBeam recordings three times daily, for 3 to 7 days. The ECG signal quality was evaluated as the percentage of recordings rejected by the HeartBeam cloud-based software due to insufficient signal quality. The specificity of HeartBeam in classification of non-ischemic recordings was performed by application of HeartBeam’s ACS detection algorithm. It was assumed that none of the patients was ischemic during the study period, as none reported chest pain symptoms.
Study results:
The study generated a total of 1845 recordings; 15.2% (282/1845) of the recordings were rejected by HeartBeam due to insufficient signal quality and had to be repeated. The false positive rate of the HeartBeam algorithm in classification of non-ischemic recordings was zero. In other words, the specificity was 100% in real-life use of our system in asymptomatic patients.
Competition
The cardiac monitoring and detection market is characterized by rapid technological change and strong competition. There are numerous companies developing technologies that are competitive, in a broad sense, to our products, and many of these companies have significantly greater resources than we do.
In the category of ambulatory (telehealth) cardiac monitors — devices that are intended to be used outside of a health facility setting — there are two major segments: consumer devices and devices prescribed for ACS.
Consumer Devices
The consumer device segment consists of devices that are FDA cleared but are sold directly to patients, without a prescription. Generally, these devices are single lead ECG devices intended to recognize heart rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, but are not intended for ischemia detection or for life threatening conditions such as heart attack. 
•Apple Inc, a public company located in Cupertino, CA, produces the Apple Watch, which includes ECG functionality. The Apple Watch is a single lead ECG with two electrodes that contact the wrist and the finger and is intended to detect only Atrial Fibrillation. 
•AliveCor Inc, a private company located in Mountain View, CA, produces the KardiaMobile, KardiaMobile Card and KardiaMobile 6L devices. These devices are intended to detect heart rhythm irregularities, such as Atrial Fibrillation, only. 
•Google Inc, a public company located in Mountain View, CA, produces the Fitbit Sense smartwatch and ECG app. The Fitbit Sense watch is a single lead ECG with two electrodes that contact the fingers and is intended to detect only Atrial Fibrillation. 
•Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, based in Seoul, South Korea, is publicly traded in Korea. It produces the Galaxy Watch3 and Galaxy Watch Active2 smartwatches with ECG functionality, intended to detect only Atrial Fibrillation.
Devices prescribed for ischemia detection 
There are a small number of devices that have been cleared by FDA to be used outside of healthcare facilities that provide information for patients with potential ischemic events such as MIs.
•Angel Medical Systems, Inc. is a private company based in Eatontown, NJ. The AngelMed Guardian is an implantable cardiac monitor for patients who are deemed to be extremely high risk for an MI. Physicians implant the AngelMed Guardian in patients. The company believes that the HeartBeam device will be a viable alternative to the AngelMed Guardian, as it does not require an implant and does not have a high up-front cost.
•SHL Telemedicine Ltd., is based in Tel Aviv, Israel and is publicly traded. It produces Smartheart Pro, a 12 lead ECG indicated for patient use at home. Smartheart Pro is larger and more complex than our telehealth solution, requiring the placement of an electrode belt, two underarm electrodes and a waist electrode, and moistening the areas before use. Most patients would find this technology not suited to be carried with them at all times because of the large size and complex lead attachment procedure. 
There are several competitors in the category of software that automatically analyzes 12 lead ECGs performed in healthcare facilities, specifically in an ED. Major competitors in this market include the following:
•General Electric, a publicly traded company based in Chicago, IL produces a line of ECG equipment. The company also has developed the GE Marquette 12SL ECG analysis program, which analyzes the ST segment of the ECG to detect potential cardiac ischemia. It does not use the 3D vector approach in deriving a diagnostic suggestion.
•Koninklijke Philips N.V., a publicly traded company based in Amsterdam, NL, produces a range of ECG products, including products that feature the DXL algorithm for resting ECGs. The Philips DXL algorithm monitors the ST segment to detect STEMI. It does use the 3D vector approach in deriving a diagnostic suggestion.
Intellectual Property
We believe our innovations are protected with a strong patent portfolio. For a limited number of aspects of our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret protection. It is our view that the combination of these two methods of intellectual property protection maximizes our chances for success. 
The issued and pending U.S. patent applications cover compact systems for remote detection and/or diagnosis of AMI. The pending EU and CN patent applications correspond to the pending and issued US cases. The pending PCT applications cover methods and apparatuses for automatic cardiac diagnosis as well as compact systems including retractable electrodes.
HeartBeam has three issued U.S. patents (U.S.10,433,744, U.S.10,117,592 and U.S.11,071,490), and six pending U.S applications. Three of the pending applications have published, all of the remaining three pending cases are unpublished. Outside of the U.S., HeartBeam has three pending EU utility patent applications (one of which is allowed), one pending CA utility patent application, one pending CN utility patent application, one pending JP utility patent application, one pending AU application, and two pending PCT applications. The issued patents are predicted to expire between April 11, 2036 and October 5, 2041.

We have entered into, and generally plan to continue to enter into, non-disclosure, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we intend to generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
The ownership of all filed patents is assigned to HeartBeam, Inc. At this time one additional patent application is being drafted by us.
Research and Development
The primary objective of our research and development program is to provide innovative, user friendly solutions with high medical value. To date, we have been highly successful in developing our initial products. The emphasis has been on developing a user-friendly solution that is always with the patient and that provides assistance to physicians in diagnosing heart attacks in chest pain patients.
Our Research and Development team is largely based in Belgrade, Serbia. We have assembled a highly capable team currently consisting of PhD level contributors who are credited with developing our key inventions and patents. The diverse group includes nuclear physicists, signal processing specialists, and biomedical engineers. We plan to continue to utilize this team in the future.
Future research and development efforts are expected to focus on the application of signal processing and artificial intelligence to address a range of cardiac conditions.
Future Products
Our core technology — the heart vector approach adopted and invented by our scientific team — is a platform technology that can provide diagnostic solutions to a variety of cardiovascular patients. Our plans call for expanding solutions that diagnose all major cardiac conditions that are diagnosed by ECGs.
Our future plans include the development of a 12-lead capable patch ECG monitor that is expected to provide advantages over existing single-lead ECG patch products such as the Zio-XT from iRhythm Technologies, Inc. Our plan is to offer a 12-lead ECG with a patch that is very similar, in dimensions and look and feel, to the currently available single lead ECG patches. We believe providing standard of care 12-lead ECG capabilities will have significant diagnostic advantages over a single lead patch.
While our initial telehealth Product is powered by a software expert system that serves as a diagnostic aid to a physician, we plan to develop an AI based diagnostic system to supplement our diagnostic expert system.
Government Regulation
General
Our proposed products are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products.
In addition to those indicated below, the only other regulations we encounter are regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.
U.S. Regulation
The FDA governs the following activities that HeartBeam performs, will perform, upon the clearance or approval of its Product, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
•product design, and development
•product safety, testing, labeling and storage
•record keeping procedures; and
•product marketing.
There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the approval or clearance and subsequent commercial marketing of our products. These include:
•the timely submission of product listing and establishment registration information, along with associated establishment user fees;
•continued compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which require specification developers and manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
•clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
•Medical Device Reporting regulations (“MDR”), which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
•adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary, to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and
•notices of correction or removal and recall regulations.
Depending on the classification of the device, before HeartBeam can commercially distribute medical devices in the United States, it has to obtain, either prior 510(k) clearance, 510(k) de-novo clearance or premarket approval (PMA), from the 
FDA unless a respective exemption applies to the device under review by the FDA. 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness:
•Class I medical devices, which are low risk and subject to only general controls (e.g., registration and listing, medical device labeling compliance, MDRs, Quality System Regulations, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding) and, in some cases, to the 510(k) premarket clearance requirements;
•Class II medical devices, which are moderate risk and generally require 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States as well as general controls and potentially special controls like performance standards or specific labeling requirements; and
•Class III medical devices, which are devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III medical devices generally require the submission and approval of a PMA supported by clinical trial data.
The custom software and hardware of our products, we believe, are classified as Class II that will run on a Class I platform. Class II medical devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient histories and FDA guidance documents. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k). As part of the 510(k), the FDA may have required the following:
•Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use;
•Completion of extensive preclinical tests and preclinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
•Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices; and
•If appropriate and required, certain types of clinical trials (IDE submission and approval may be required for conducting a clinical trial in the US).
Clinical trials involve use of the medical device on human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent for their participation in the clinical study. A written protocol with predefined end points, an appropriate sample size and pre-determined patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, is required before initiating and conducting a clinical trial. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring 
responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but it must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.
Given successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) premarket notification or 510(k) de-novo will be submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. This notification will include all relevant data from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation.
A 510(k) clearance letter from the FDA authorizes commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications of use.
After 510(k) clearance, HeartBeam is required to comply with a number of post-clearance requirements, including, but not limited to, Medical Device Reporting and complaint handling, and, if applicable, reporting of corrective actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to QSRs. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with FDA’s Quality System Regulations (QSRs), which impose extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements on medical device manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the change, validation activities may need to be performed. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs and other types of regulatory controls.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance from the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use or technological characteristics, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, will also regulate the advertising claims of HeartBeam’s products to ensure that the claims it makes are consistent with its regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that product advertising is neither false nor misleading.
We will apply for 510(k) clearance for both our cloud-based diagnostic engine for the ED product and the cloud-based diagnostic engine and hardware components of our telehealth Product. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a notification to the FDA demonstrating that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device (i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or Class II, or a 510(k)-cleared device). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted but also can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Once the information is submitted, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant a company 510(k) clearance for its pipeline products, and failure to obtain the necessary clearances for its products would adversely affect its ability to grow its business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive the necessary clearances, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce its business prospects.
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk may be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo process. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (“FDAMA”) added the de novo classification pathway now codified in section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. This law established an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III 
after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent, or NSE, determination in response to a 510(k) submission. Through this regulatory process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receipt, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device through what is called a “de novo request.” In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), in order to provide a second option for de novo classification. Under this second pathway, a sponsor who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence can submit a de novo request to FDA without first submitting a 510(k).
In the event that a company receives a Not Substantially Equivalent determination in response to a 510(k) submission, the device may still be eligible for the 510(k) de novo classification process.
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) or 510(k) de novo classification process require the submission of a PMA. The PMA process is much more time consuming and demanding than the 510(k) notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from preclinical and/or clinical studies and data relating to manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA’s in-depth review of the information generally takes between one and three years and may take significantly longer. 
We also need to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We plan to do this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485:2013 Medical Devices — Quality Management Systems — Requirements for Regulatory Purposes. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
In order to reduce time and minimize the need to hire permanent technical and regulatory staffing in pursuing our FDA clearances we have contracted with a service provider to prepare our Products for FDA submission. This is the most efficient way to maximize our chances for timely FDA clearances. 
Based on all available data and opinions from our well qualified external consultants who specialize in FDA submissions, we believe that both our initial products and the follow-on products qualify for the 510(k) clearance path. 
Foreign Regulation
As we plan to market our products in the EU and other foreign markets, in addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Preparations for FDA Clearance Submissions and Design for Manufacturing
Up to this point, we have focused primarily on research and development of our first two Products. At this time, we have fully functional versions of our first two Products which we have used in most of our medical studies. We consider them to be pre-production versions as they need to go through a full FDA class improvement and testing cycle before they can be presented to the FDA for a 510(k) clearance. We are not yet at a stage to commence volume production of our products.
We have a contract with LIVMOR to prepare our ED Product for clearance via a 510(K) submission to the FDA. The principal terms of this contract are to incorporate the product requirements, user needs, and 3D vector algorithm plugin developed by HeartBeam into the ED MI software product. Our contract with Triple Ring, Inc., US-based medical device and design organization (“TRIPLE RING”) as the development partner is to turn the ECG Hardware prototype into a commercially ready product cleared by the FDA. The principal terms of the agreement require TRIPLE RING to perform 
the design, development, and testing of the ECG device and interface with the user application. With oversight from and in partnership with HeartBeam, TRIPLE RING will define all requirements, testing, detailed design, verification protocols, and test cases for all subsystems included in the ECG device product. Once the subsystems are complete, the service provider will perform system-level software testing. Once completed, the product will be provided to HeartBeam to perform system validation testing using clinical data from post-MI patients.
We plan to have a scalable manufacturing strategy.
Based on our extensive research and reference checking, we believe that TRIPLE RING, an FDA Registered and ISO 13485 Certified organization, has experience in both product development of medical devices and manufacturing capabilities that we intend to use in the limited market release of our telehealth Generation 1 Product. We plan to consider other manufacturers, inside and outside the US, for our high-volume manufacturing. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 5 full-time employees. We have budgeted to hire additional full-time employees (including additional consultants or independent contractors) in the near future to execute our growth plans.
We consider our employee relations to be good.
