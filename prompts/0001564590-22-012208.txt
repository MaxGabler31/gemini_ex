 We operate primarily in domestic markets. 
 Industry Overview
 Mobile phone growth has changed the way customers and businesses interact. The majority of the world’s population now utilizes mobile phones and mobile phone usage is expected to continue to grow as the primary consumer communication device for the foreseeable future. According a 2021 study published by Pew Research, 85% of the population in the United States has a smart phone. According to a 2019 eMarketer study, consumers are spending more time on their mobile devices than in front of televisions for the first time, a trend that is forecasted to grow. According to MarketingCharts, the top two uses of mobile phones among consumers are texting/messaging and calling. We believe it is critical for many businesses to develop strategies to understand their consumer engagement across multiple communication channels as consumer seamlessly shift between different forms of communication during the buying process. 
 For many businesses, calls and texts are critical to drive sales. For businesses of all sizes, in-bound phones calls can be a key source of new customer leads and increased revenue. We believe consumers that call or text businesses directly typically have higher purchase intent and can be more likely to make a purchase or become a customer. According to an independent research study by Forrester Consulting, the study found that phone customers convert faster, spend more, and have a higher retention rate than customers who contact brands through other channels. Based on a survey of marketing decision makers, the study found that that 60% of marketers said that those who initiate an inbound call in the course of the customer journey convert an average of 30% faster, spend an average of 28% more, and 54% of marketers said they have a 28% higher retention rate. In addition, according to MessageDesk, 77% of consumers prefer to talk to someone over other means of communication such as a chatbot. Calls and texts can be particularly relevant in high-value categories, such as automotive, digital agencies, home services, insurance, telecommunications and travel and hospitality, where transaction values are large, complex or require additional information prior to completion. Calls and texts are also important for local businesses that set appointments or sell products and services over the phone. 
 Calls and texts are increasingly important to business and consumer interactions and to mobile advertising. We believe that the demand for businesses to connect with consumers over the phone, combined with the inherent functionality and technical capabilities of mobile devices, will result in calls and texts becoming a primary measurement unit/format for mobile advertising. As customers continue to shift their budgets to accommodate for the growth of mobile channels, we believe the market for conversation analytics and advertising solutions will grow even more. According to a study from App Annie, global mobile advertising grew 23% in 2021 to $295 billion and is expected to reach $350 billion in 2022. Calls and texts are two of the primary consumer communication methods with businesses on mobile devices and building solutions to help businesses understand their consumer interactions through these communication channels can help businesses engage and grow.

Understanding calls and/or texts is highly complex. Unlike clicks, impressions and other actions that are tracked and measured in digital format, calls and text messages take place offline and require unique technical capabilities and expertise to accurately measure and analyze. To realize the full benefit of call and/or text-based marketing, customers need technology that allows them to capture and analyze attributes of a call and/or text before, during and after the call and/or text is completed. This technology can connect the conversation from the placed advertisement through the interaction with the business, often with individual sales representatives, to understand the effectiveness of the marketing action. This can help better measure return on investment (“ROI”) and optimize marketing campaigns across media channels. For example, customers want to be able to dynamically track the source of a call back to the media channels and advertisements that influenced the consumer to make the call. Once a call is initiated, technology is required to understand what is happening on a call, to record anonymized calls, and to block unwanted or spam calls. For customers with call center operations, calls are often tracked and routed through interactive voice response (“IVR”) phone systems and integrated with customer relationship management (“CRM”) applications and back-office systems to measure transactions and return on investment. Successful marketing analytics for calls and texts requires expertise from multiple disciplines, including digital advertising, communications infrastructure, voice and speech recognition expertise, and marketing software.
 Competitive Strengths and Competition
 We believe that the principal factors that drive success in the market are our competitive strengths, including:
 Focus on calls and texts. Over the past several years, with the increasing importance that mobile devices play in consumer interactions with businesses and in advertising, we have shifted the focus of our company to address the large opportunity to help businesses accelerate sales through improving their interactions with consumers over the phone and, more recently, through text communications. As consumer usage and mobile performance advertising has grown over the last decade, it is driving growth in offline actions like calls and texts. As one of the first companies to help businesses utilize data driven insights and analytics to accelerate sales from phone conversations, we have developed solutions which can deliver measurable return on investment to both large national brands and local small businesses through tying these offline phone conversations to their online marketing initiatives and offering sales acceleration solutions to help business create a better customer experience and grow sales. Our conversational analytics technology and products are specifically designed to help address the challenges associated with closing the loop between digital marketing and phone calls. We are developing solutions that can provide customers insights across a broad spectrum of conversations they are have with their customers in voice and text communications along with solutions to engage consumers in their preferred communication channels. Working closely with our customers, we have innovated in conversational intelligence technology, creating specific solutions to address common needs and wants among both large enterprise customers and small businesses. We believe we are unique with our call and more recently text focused approach to technology developments and marketing solutions, facilitating a competitive advantage as mobile advertising grows and advertising budgets shift towards performance-based formats and consumer communication channels with businesses expand across multiple communication channels.
 Conversational Intelligence platform powered by artificial intelligence augmented technology. Marchex’s conversational intelligence platform delivers data into sales engagement communication tools and can provide closed loop marketing insights on offline customer interactions and operational insights to customers looking to accelerate sales and to measure the performance of their customer interactions during the sales process viamultiple communication paths including voice and text channels. When consumers call or text a business or call center from their phones, our technology can analyze that call or text data using machine and deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence-powered conversation analysis functionality that can deliver real-time conversational insights and feedback to companies on the quality of their customer interactions during the sales process as well as to identity lost businesses opportunities. Our data can also help customers adjust and improve their marketing strategies in order to create personalized solutions to drive more sales over the phone either directly with the business or the call center. This intelligence can help advertisers optimize their ad campaigns across media channels, keywords, and creative elements, which helps maximize their return on investment. We also provide integrations with other marketing dashboards to provide advertisers one place to 
 6
 

review their analytics information. Integrations may take the form of working with CRM platforms or customer-specific systems, with the purpose of enhancing advertisers’ understanding and measurement of outcomes at scale. We are consistently working to create products to help advertisers understand what is happening during conversations with their customers and how to spend their budgets more efficiently, whether the channel is online, offline, or mobile. Our conversational intelligence technology also can help determine which of these calls converts into a sale while helping businesses evaluate the sales effectiveness of individual store locations or even individual sales representatives at a business. Access to these insights provides businesses visibility and measurement into their ad expenditures by closing the loop with actual sales coversations. With Marchex’s conversational intelligence technology, we are leveraging proprietary technology to analyze and deliver actionable advertising and operational insights to businesses that engage with consumers over the phone or via text.
 Transparent pricing model. Marchex generally charges based on the number of conversations, either by call or text, that occur between a business and its customers, which it processes on behalf of the business. This enables businesses to adopt Marchex products through a transparent model that scales as a customer’s usage increases and may include a minimum commitment. Through our conversational analytics technology, we can develop a deep understanding of which publishers, devices, ad formats, keywords and ad creatives drive conversation conversion for specific advertising verticals and helps optimize the placements of advertisements across different sources that drive valuable call or text leads for customers. We work with customers to define a quality call or text conversation for their business, and then generally charge our customers, on a per call or text conversation basis. Similarly, as customers look to gain critical business insights or alerts at the moment a conversation with a sales representative or business fails to produce a desired outcome, Marchex will earn a fee based on the number of conversations it applies its sales engagement technology to on behalf of the customer which may include a minimum commitment. As a result, we are able to provide a measurable return on investment for our customers. 
 
Scalable technology platform and business model. We have developed our technology platform to address large customers, while also being able to support a large number of small local businesses. Our platform can support hundreds of millions of calls and thousands of unique customer accounts, and in aggregate help brands manage many dollars in advertising spend across various digital channels. 
 
The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. We compete with conversation analytics providers such as Twilio, EZ Texting, CallSource, CallRail, and Invoca. As we advance our data analytics technologies, the competitive landscape will increase and become broader.
 
Our Strategy
 
Innovating on Conversational Intelligence Technology and Solutions. We plan to continue to expand and invest in our conversational intelligence technology and expand our AI, data science, and machine learning capabilities. We also plan to continue to expand our range of call, text, and other communication channels analytics and sales engagement product capabilities by growing our conversation intelligence solutions, including AI-driven speech technology solutions, call tracking, call monitoring, text communications, keyword-level tracking, display ad impression measurement and other products as part of our owned, end-to-end, call and text-based advertising solutions. Our expanding capabilities are enabling us to develop new solutions, like sales engagement and personalization solutions that enable us to take advantage of our growing conversational data assets.

Supporting and Growing the Number of Customers Using Our Products and Services. We plan to continue invest in technology initiatives like Marchex Anywhere which we believe will enable us to access an wider base of businesses by offering our products to a new array of channel partners.  Through these initiatives Marchex can now integrate with businesses existing communication providers or telephony infrastructure providers to offer its products and services. Increasingly, Marchex customers will no longer have to access separate telephony infrastructure to engage with our conversational intelligence suite of products but, instead, will be able to choose to access our products from within their existing communications provider of choice.We also plan to continue to provide a consistently high level of service and support to our conversational intelligence solutions customers and we will continue to focus on helping them achieve their return on investment goals. We are focused on increasing our customer base through our direct sales and marketing efforts, including strategic sales, inside sales, and additional partnerships with resellers. 
 Pursuing Selective Acquisition Opportunities. We have historically and in the future may pursue select acquisition opportunities and will apply evaluation criteria to any acquisitions we may pursue in order to enhance our strategic position, strengthen our financial profile, augment our points of defensibility and increase shareholder value. We generally focus on acquisition opportunities that represent one or more of the following characteristics:

• | revenue growth and expanding margins and operating profitability or the characteristics to achieve larger scale and profitability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | opportunities for business model, product or service innovation, evolution or expansion;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | under-leveraged and under-commercialized assets in related or unrelated businesses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an opportunity to enhance efficiencies and provide incremental growth opportunities for our operating businesses; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | business defensibility.
--+------------------------

 Evolving Our Business Strategy. Our industry is undergoing significant change and our business strategy is continuing to evolve to meet these changes. In order to profitably grow our business, we may need to expand our current lines of business as well as explore new lines of business beyond our current focus of providing mobile advertising intelligence products and services, which may involve pursuing strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions of, or investments in, related or unrelated businesses. In addition, we may seek divestitures of existing businesses or assets. For example, in October 2020, we sold certain assets related to our Call Marketplace, Local Leads Platform and other assets not related to core conversational analytics. 
 Developing New Markets. We intend to analyze opportunities and may seek to expand our technology-based products into new business areas where our services can be replicated on a cost-effective basis, or where the creation or development of a product or service may be appropriate. We have technology integration partnerships and referral agreements with Adobe, Google Search, and Salesforce, Facebook, and other third-party marketers. We anticipate utilizing various strategies to enter new markets, including developing strategic relationships; innovating with existing proprietary technologies; acquiring products that address a new category or opportunity; and creating joint venture relationships.Sales, Marketing & Business Development
 Our sales team focuses on adding new customers to our business and growing existing customer relationships, while our business development and partnership activities focus on adding new customers, reseller partnerships and servicing existing partnerships. Our marketing team focuses on promoting our services through online customer acquisition, affiliate relationships, press coverage, strategic marketing campaigns and industry exposure.

telesales and attendance at industry events, among other methods. Our customer agreements include a combination of agency fees and cost-per-action fees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology Integration Partnerships and Referral Agreements. We have integration partnerships with Adobe, Google, Salesforce, Customer Relationship Management software providers and other third-party channel partners. We also have referral agreements with entities that promote our services to large numbers of potential customers including select technology partners. Our referral partner agreements are based on revenue sharing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reseller Partnerships. We have a business development team that focuses primarily on securing partnerships with large reseller partners, under which we supply and integrate our products and services. Our reseller partner agreements include a combination of revenue and profit sharing, licensing revenue, conversation intelligence, and text conversation cost per actions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to continue our strategy of increasing our customer base through sales and marketing programs while being efficient in terms of our marketing and advertising costs. We continually evaluate our marketing and advertising strategies to optimize the effectiveness of our programs and their return on investment.
 
Information Technology and Systems
 We have a proprietary technology platform for the purposes of managing and delivering call and cost-per-conversation analytics and texting products and services to our partners. We also combine third-party licenses and hardware to create an operating environment for delivering high quality products and services, with such features as automated online account creation and management process for customers, real-time customer support with both interactive and online reporting for customers and partners. We employ commercially available technologies and products distributed by various companies, including Cisco, Dell, Oracle, Intel, AMD, Microsoft, and IBM. We also utilize public domain software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Java, Scala and Tomcat.
 Our technology platform is compatible with many systems used by our customers, enabling us to deliver call and cost-per-action analytics and texting products and services through mobile, online and offline sources in rapid response to user queries made through our customers at scale. We continue to build and innovate additional functionality to attempt to meet the quickly evolving demands of the marketplace. We devote significant financial and human resources to improving our customer experiences by continuing to develop our technology infrastructure. The cost of developing our technology solutions is included in the overall cost structure of our services and is not separately funded by any individual customers. In order to maintain a professional level of service and availability, we primarily rely upon third parties to provide hosting services, including hardware support and service, and network monitoring at various domestic and international locations. Our servers and cloud-based services are configured for high availability and large volumes of call, mobile and texting based traffic and are located in leased third party facilities or deployed through cloud-based solution providers. Back-end databases make use of redundant servers and data storage arrays. We also have standby servers that provide for additional capacity as necessary. The facilities housing our servers provide redundant HVAC, power and internet connectivity. As revenue grows and the volume of transactions and call, mobile and texting traffic increases, we will need to expand our network infrastructure. Inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher call, mobile and texting traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
 
We continuously review ways to improve major aspects of our technology support and maintenance, including improving, upgrading and implementing business continuity plans, data retention initiatives, and backup and recovery processes.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, we have experience seasonality and we believe that we will continue to do so. Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and our experience has shown that during the spring and summer months, call volumes in certain verticals such as home services are generally higher than during other times of the year. Further, during the latter part of the fourth quarter of the calendar year we generally experience lower call 
 9
 

volumes. The extent to which call volumes may decrease during these off-peak periods is difficult to predict. Historically, we have seen this trend generally reversing in the first quarter of the calendar year with increased call volumes and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for many of our customers with fiscal years ending December 31. However, there can be no assurances such seasonal trends will consistently repeat each year. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
        We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
 As of December 31, 2021, in the United States, we have been issued 26 patents, which are estimated to expire between 2027 and 2038, and have 7 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, in Canada we also have 1 issued patent which expires in 2026 and 1 patent application pending for examination. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we have 11 trademarks registered in the United States, 7 trademarks pending registration in the United States, and 32 trademarks registered in foreign jurisdictions.  
 We further seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of 187 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relationships to be positive. If we were unable to retain our key employees or we were unable to maintain adequate staffing of qualified employees, particularly during peak sales seasons, our business would be adversely affected.
