Item 1. Business
When used in this Annual Report, the terms “Nuverra,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Overview
Nuverra is a leading provider of water logistics and oilfield services to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. Our services include the delivery, collection, and disposal of solid and liquid materials that are used in and generated by the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas. We utilize a broad array of assets to meet our customers’ logistics and environmental management needs. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We provide a suite of solutions to customers who demand safety, environmental compliance and accountability from their service providers. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 2007 as “Heckmann Corporation.” On May 16, 2013, we changed our name to Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. 
Our service offering focuses on providing comprehensive environmental and logistics management solutions within three primary groups:

• | Water Transfer Services: Collection and transportation of flowback and produced water from drilling and completion activities to disposal networks via trucking or a fixed pipeline system, and delivery of freshwater for drilling and completion activities via trucking, lay flat temporary line or fixed pipeline system.


• | Disposal Services: Disposal of liquid waste water from hydraulic fracturing operations, liquid waste water from well production, and solid drilling waste in our disposal wells and landfill.


• | Logistics and Wellsite Services: Rental of wellsite equipment and provision of other wellsite services including preparation and remediation. 

Business Strategy
Nuverra strives to be a leader in the oilfield services sector by providing value to our customers through an integrated service offering of water management solutions. Our strategy is focused on: (1) reinvesting in our core business in order to drive organic growth and provide a stable revenue stream, (2) maximizing our attractive asset base to capitalize on favorable industry trends, and (3) continuing to develop leading service offerings as the water management industry continues to evolve. 
Our produced water hauling and disposal business provides a reliable revenue stream, as produced water is generated with or without drilling rig activity. While prices fluctuate throughout each industry cycle, produced water volumes typically increase or remain relatively stable. Spears & Associates, an industry market share research firm, estimates in their October 2018 report entitled, “The US Oilfield Water Management Services Market” (the “Report”) that produced water volumes for disposal will increase anywhere between 4% to 5% annually for the years 2019 through 2023. 
Our network of assets are strategically located in the Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Southern regions. We have built a strong reputation in the industry as a result of providing our customers with excellent service quality over many years. Within the oilfield service sector, there are several key buying factors that determine the value we provide to our customers, such as: commitment to health, safety and environment; service quality including regulatory compliance; price; capacity and proximity; and technology. We continue to evolve our service offerings to address the critical value drivers while adapting to the changing water management industry. The current trend of integrated gathering and disposal systems is driving increased use of water pipelines. Our saltwater disposal wells (or “SWDs”) and pipeline are an integral part of our produced water business. SWDs provide core assets that we can leverage to provide incremental offerings on existing disposal and water midstream projects. We are also evaluating additional service line growth opportunities. As we continue to refine our portfolio and footprint, we may consider opportunistic asset sales to provide additional capital to fund our growth investments.

Market Overview
Nuverra operates in the large and fragmented market for water management. Spears & Associates estimates in their Report that the 2019 market size in the United States (or “U.S.”) for oilfield water management will be approximately $25.6 billion. The primary services in Spears & Associates’ market estimate include water hauling, water disposal, water treatment, water storage, water acquisition, water flowback, and water transfer services. Nuverra provides the majority of these services, but does not have a presence in all U.S. geographic markets. Therefore, management believes there is significant opportunity for market share gains as the Company expands its resources. Spears & Associates’ projects in their Report that the U.S. oilfield water hauling market will be approximately $8.0 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $10.0 billion in 2023 for a compounded annual growth rate of 6% over the 2018 to 2023 timeframe.
Nuverra is well positioned to benefit from the favorable trends in the broader oilfield services industry, such as hydraulic fracturing activity, well counts and footage drilled. According to World Oil’s Forecast and Data 2019 Executive Summary Report, U.S. drilling in 2019 will increase 4.0% over 2018 to 28,065 wells, and footage drilled in 2019 will increase 5.0% over 2018 to 341 million feet of hole. There is opportunity for Nuverra to capitalize on these positive industry trends, specifically in our landfill, wellsite rentals, and water transfer services. These services deliver higher margins and provide us with the ability to enhance our profits during industry expansion cycles.
From a geographic perspective, Nuverra remains focused on being the premier service provider in our core areas of the Bakken, Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville basins. We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in other areas. However, we do not plan to enter a market unless we believe we can generate attractive profitability and returns on invested capital. While some basins offer significant levels of activity, attractive economics for certain service providers are not assured given the amount of competition in those basins.
Advances in drilling technology and the development of unconventional North American hydrocarbon plays allow previously inaccessible or non-economical formations in the earth’s crust to be accessed by utilizing high pressure methods from water injection (or the process known as hydraulic fracturing) combined with proppant fluids (containing sand grains or ceramic beads) to create new perforation depths and fissures to extract natural gas, oil, and other hydrocarbon resources. Significant amounts of water are required for hydraulic fracturing operations, and subsequently, complex water flows, in the forms of flowback and produced water, represent a waste stream generated by these methods of hydrocarbon exploration and production. In addition to the liquid product stream involved in the hydraulic fracturing process, there are also significant environmental solid waste streams that are generated during the drilling and completion of a well. During the drilling process, a combination of the cut rock, or “cuttings,” mixed with the liquid used to drill the well, is returned to the surface and must be handled in accordance with environmental and other regulations. Historically, much of this solid waste byproduct was buried at the well site. We believe customers will increasingly focus on the offsite disposal or recycling of the solid waste byproduct. Produced water volumes, which represent water from the formation produced alongside hydrocarbons over the life of the well, are generally driven by geological considerations, combined with marginal costs of production and frequently create a multi-year demand for our services once the well has been drilled and completed.
In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry are affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities. However, there is no guarantee that oil and natural gas prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see a continuing increase in a demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with oil prices dropping more than 40% during the fourth quarter of 2018. Another prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.
Operations
Our business consists of operations in shale basins where customers’ exploration and production (“E&P”) activities are predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows:

• | Oil shale areas: includes our operations in the Bakken shale area. (Our exit of the Eagle Ford shale area started March 1, 2018, and was substantially complete by June 30, 2018. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information on our exit of the Eagle Ford shale area.) For 2018, 66% of our revenues from continuing operations were derived from the oil shale areas. 


• | Natural gas shale areas: includes our operations in the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville shale areas. During 2018, 34% of our revenues from continuing operations were derived from natural gas shale areas. 

6

Our business operations are comprised of three geographically distinct divisions, which are further described in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein:

• | Rocky Mountain Division: comprising the Bakken shale area;


• | Northeast Division: comprising the Marcellus and Utica shale areas; and


• | Southern Division: comprising the Haynesville shale area and Eagle Ford shale area (which we exited during the six months ended June 30, 2018).

The shale areas in which we currently operate and that comprise our operating divisions are described below. The technically recoverable resources for the shale areas noted below were obtained from the Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2019 report issued in January of 2019 by the United States Energy Information Administration with data as of January 1, 2017 (the “EIA 2019 Report”). The EIA 2019 Report notes that estimates of technically recoverable resources are highly uncertain, with early estimates tending to vary and shift significantly over time as new geological information is gained through drilling, or as long-term productivity is clarified or improved through technology and better management practices. 

• | The Bakken and underlying Three Forks formations are the two primary reservoirs currently being developed in the Williston Basin, which covers most of western North Dakota, eastern Montana, northwest South Dakota and southern Saskatchewan. According to the EIA 2019 Report, the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations contain an estimated 16.0 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves.


• | The Marcellus shale area is located in the Appalachian Basin in the Northeastern United States, primarily in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and Ohio. The Marcellus shale area is the largest natural gas field in North America with approximately 262.5 trillion cubic feet (or “Tcf”) of technically recoverable natural gas, according to the EIA 2019 Report.


• | Adjacent to the Marcellus shale area is the Utica shale area, located primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Still in the early stages of development, the Utica shale area has three identified areas: oil, condensate and dry natural gas. According to the EIA 2019 Report, the Utica shale area is estimated to have approximately 193.9 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas and 1.6 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves.


• | The Haynesville shale area is located across northwest Louisiana and east Texas, and extends into Arkansas. The Haynesville shale area is the third largest natural gas-producing basin in North America, with an estimated 122.2 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas according to the EIA 2019 Report.

As part of our environmental and logistics management solutions for water and water-related services, we serve E&P customers seeking fresh water acquisition, temporary or permanent water transmission and storage, transportation, or disposal of fresh flowback and produced water in connection with shale oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations. We also provide services for water pit excavations, well site preparation and well site remediation. We own an approximately 60-mile underground twin pipeline network in the Haynesville shale for the collection of produced water and the delivery of fresh water. The pipeline network can handle volumes up to approximately 60 thousand barrels per day and is scalable up to approximately 100 thousand barrels per day. We have a fleet of approximately 525 heavy duty trucks including 55 specialty trucks and 470 water trucks used for delivery and collection, and over 2,225 storage tanks. We also own or lease 48 operating saltwater disposal wells in the Bakken, Marcellus/Utica, and Haynesville shale areas. 
Within our environmental and logistics management solutions for solid materials, we provide collection, transportation, and disposal options for solid waste generated by drilling and completion activities, including an oilfield solids disposal landfill that we own and operate in the Bakken shale area. The landfill is located on a 50-acre site with current permitted capacity of more than 1.7 million cubic yards of airspace. We believe that permitted capacity at this site could be expanded up to a total of 5.8 million cubic yards in the future. 
A significant part of the Company’s service offering involves trucking operations. Nuverra’s fleet of more than 520 trucks positions the Company among the top 25 in the Petroleum & Chemical sector according to Transport Topics’ 2018 Top 100 Private Carriers. The Company is experiencing the same driver shortage challenge that most U.S. trucking companies are facing. As a result of these challenges, Nuverra has successfully implemented trucking price increases and implemented a number of initiatives to increase truck driver recruitment and retention. These initiatives started to show results in the second half of 2018 with driver count increasing approximately 7.0%.

Our fleet utilizes GPS and other automation tools that we expect to upgrade as technology progresses. Our service has long included electronic logging devices (ELDs). As a result, the new regulations from the U.S. Department of Transportation that include the requirement for electronic logs (rather than paper logs that can be adjusted) that became effective in December of 2017 did not impact our business. We believe that this new regulation has been positive for Nuverra as it has caused many of our less sophisticated competitors to bear higher compliance costs in 2018 that are more equivalent to the compliance costs that Nuverra has been incurring for some time. 
Customers
Our customers include major domestic and international oil and natural gas companies, foreign national oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our three largest customers were Hess Corporation, Southwestern Energy and Oasis Petroleum which represented 11%, 10% and 8%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues. The loss of any one of these three customers could have a material adverse affect on the Company. 
Competition
Our competition includes small regional service providers, as well as larger companies with operations throughout the continental United States and internationally. Some of our competitors are Select Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc., TETRA Technologies, Inc., MBI Energy Services, Inc., Stallion Oilfield Services, LLC, Waste Connections, Inc., Pinnergy, Ltd., McKenzie Energy Partners, LLC, and Buckhorn Energy Services, LLC. 
Health, Safety & Environment
We are committed to excellence in health, safety and environment (“HS&E”) in our operations, which we believe is a critical characteristic of our business. Our customers in the unconventional shale basins require us to meet high standards on HS&E matters. As a result, we believe that being a leading environmental solutions company with a national presence and a dedicated focus on environmental solutions is a competitive advantage relative to smaller, regional companies, as well as companies that provide certain environmental services as ancillary offerings.
Seasonality
Certain of our business divisions are impacted by seasonal factors. Generally, our business is negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our trucks and equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenue. In addition, these conditions may impact our customers’ operations, and, as our customers’ drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing activities are curtailed, our services may also be reduced.
Intellectual Property
We operate under numerous trade names and own several trademarks, the most important of which are “Nuverra,” “HWR,” “Power Fuels,” and “Heckmann Water Resources.” 
Operating Risks
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in our industry, including accidents and fires that could cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment, suspension of operations and litigation, as described in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, associated with these hazards. Because our business involves the transportation of environmentally regulated materials, we may also experience traffic accidents or pipeline breaks that may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. We have implemented a comprehensive HS&E program designed to minimize accidents in the workplace, enhance our safety programs, maintain environmental compliance and improve the efficiency of our operations.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.

Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs. From another perspective, a carbon constrained environment would likely reward hydrocarbons produced from low cost areas. 
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. In Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. In Pennsylvania, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission. In Ohio, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. In North Dakota, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the North Dakota Department of Health, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, Oil and Gas Division, and 
9

the North Dakota State Water Commission. In Montana, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the Montana Board of Oil and Gas.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Saltwater Disposal Wells
We operate saltwater disposal wells that are subject to the CWA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or “SDWA,” and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the Underground Injection Control Program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” which establishes minimum requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities. Our saltwater disposal wells are located in Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas. Regulations in many states require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our saltwater disposal wells in those states. These regulatory agencies have the general authority to suspend or modify one or more of these permits if continued operation of one of our saltwater wells is likely to result in pollution of freshwater, tremors or earthquakes, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or leaks to the environment. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the saltwater wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and claims by third parties for property damages and personal injuries.
Transportation Regulations
We conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” The waste water and other water flows we transport by truck are generally not regulated as hazmat at this time.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various states environmental and waste water transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work and are intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health. Due to the specialized nature of our operations in the oil and gas industry, we qualify for an exception in the federal HOS rules (i.e., the “Oilfield Exemption”). Drivers of most property-carrying commercial motor vehicles have to take at least 34 hours off duty in order to reset their accumulated hours under the 60/70-hour rule, but drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles that are used exclusively to support oil and gas activities can restart with just 24 hours off under the Oilfield Exemption. However, there are other HOS regulations that affect our operations, including the 11-Hour Driving Limit, 14-Hour On Duty Limit, 30-Minute Rest Break, 60/70-Hour Limit On Duty in 7/8 consecutive days. Compliance with these rules directly impacts our operating costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 715 full time employees, of whom 144 were executive, managerial, sales, general, administrative, and accounting staff, and 571 were truck drivers, service providers and field workers. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppages, and believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees.
Emergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization
On May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the “Nuverra Parties”) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the “Plan”). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) 
10

confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. On June 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree and order closing the chapter 11 cases, subject to certain conditions as set forth therein. See Note 4 on “Emergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional details. 
Upon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 5 on “Fresh Start Accounting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date. 
References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017.
