Item 1. Business 
Our Company
Core & Main, Inc. (“Core & Main” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company and its sole material asset is its direct and indirect ownership interest in Core & Main Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Holdings”). We are a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, and related services, to municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors across municipal, non residential and residential end markets nationwide. Our specialty products and services are used in the maintenance, repair, replacement and new construction of water and fire protection infrastructure. We are one of only two national distributors operating across large and highly fragmented markets, which we estimate to represent approximately $32 billion in annual revenue. 
As of January 30, 2022, we have a network of approximately 300 branch locations in 48 states across the U.S, which serve as a critical link between over 4,500 suppliers and a diverse and long-standing base of over 60,000 customers. Our sales reach, technical knowledge, broad product portfolio, customer service, project planning and delivery capabilities, and ability to provide local expertise nationwide, make us a critical partner to both our customers and suppliers.
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of approximately 200,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) covering a full spectrum of specialized products and services, including pipes, valves & fittings, storm drainage and erosion control solutions, fire protection products and fabrication services, and smart metering products and technology. Our products are unique to our industry and are tailored to local specifications.
We have a balanced mix of sales across product categories, end markets and construction sectors. We derived approximately 39% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2021”) from the municipal construction sector, 39% from the non-residential construction sector, and 22% from the residential construction sector. Furthermore, we had an equal mix of sales related to construction on new projects and existing repair and replace projects in fiscal 2021.
Our company and our people are committed to the provision of safe and sustainable water infrastructure. Our mission is to serve as an industry leader, supplying local expertise, products and services to build innovative water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection solutions for the communities we serve. We support our customers and their communities in their efforts to find both short- and long-term solutions to conserve water and manage consumption. We embrace our responsibility in contributing to the continued evolution of our industry over the long term, providing innovative technology solutions and giving visibility to the critical importance of sustainable water infrastructure and fire safety systems.
The impact of climate change and increased natural flooding disasters have highlighted the need in the U.S. for improvements in storm drainage infrastructure solutions. As flooding events accelerate, storm water management systems with higher water volume handling capabilities become more critical to avoiding disasters, and we are well-positioned to support this increasing need given our extensive storm drainage offering. There is also an increasing demand for solutions that restore and reuse water, particularly in areas of the country facing threats from droughts. Our reclaimed water products help address these water shortage concerns.
For a discussion of the impact of seasonality and weather on our business, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Business—Seasonality” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our History
Our first legacy distribution company dates back to 1874 and over the years, our company has grown through organic growth and a series of mergers and acquisitions. In 2005, The Home Depot acquired National Waterworks Holdings and subsequently merged it with Hughes Supply Inc. to establish one of the leading waterworks distributors in the United States. Under The Home Depot’s ownership, we became HD Supply Waterworks and completed several small acquisitions to further expand our geographic footprint. In 2007, a group of private equity investors acquired the HD Supply business from The Home Depot and subsequently executed an initial public offering in 2013. In August 2017, HD Supply Waterworks was acquired by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) from HD Supply and was subsequently rebranded as Core & Main. On July 27, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of Class A common stock (the “IPO”). 
Our End Markets
We have diversified end market exposure across three primary construction sectors: (i) municipal; (ii) non-residential; and (iii) residential.
Based on management’s estimates, we believe that our addressable market in the U.S. for the wholesale distribution of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, and related services, represented approximately $32 billion in revenue in 2021. Growth in our industry is driven by a broad array of factors, including municipal water infrastructure spending, water and wastewater utility rates, commercial construction, housing starts, population growth and other demographic trends.
Municipal
We estimate that approximately 39% of or net sales in fiscal 2021 were to contractors and municipalities for municipal funded projects, including the repair, replacement, upgrade and new construction of water and wastewater supply, filtration, storage and distribution systems. Municipalities establish local product specifications based on regulatory requirements and engineering standards. Given our extensive geographic footprint and technical knowledge of products and local specifications, we believe we are best equipped to anticipate and serve local needs as well as large private underground utility contractors who require national reach and an extensive product offering.
Municipal demand has exhibited steady growth over the long term due to the critical and immediate need to replace aged water infrastructure. However, due to limited available funding over the last decade, the pace of investment has significantly lagged the need to upgrade water systems throughout the U.S. and has resulted in significant underinvestment in water supply, water safety and wastewater management. In November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law, which includes $55 billion to invest in water infrastructure across the United States. In the coming years, we expect increased federal infrastructure investment to have a core focus on the upgrade, repair and replacement of municipal waterworks systems and to address demographic shifts and serve the growing population. We believe these dynamics, coupled with expanding municipal budgets, create the backdrop for a favorable funding environment and accelerated investment in projects that will benefit our business.
Non-Residential
We estimate that approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were directly related to clean water and wastewater infrastructure, storm drainage and fire protection systems supporting U.S. non-residential construction activity, including industrial, commercial, institutional, warehouse and multi-family development projects. Our products are often installed while breaking ground on new lot development during the initial construction phase, though some products, like storm drainage, are used during both new construction and repair and replace activities. Our fire protection products are typically installed at later stages of construction projects compared to most of our products and exhibit less seasonal patterns because they are generally installed indoors and are therefore less impacted by weather conditions.
Demand across the U.S. non-residential construction market has historically lagged residential construction activity as commercial development is necessary to support new housing development. With the recent growth in residential housing, we expect non-residential construction activity to increase as communities expand and demand increases for our waterworks, storm drainage and fire protection products. Furthermore, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides funding to protect against droughts, floods, heat and wildfires, funding to repair roads and bridges, and funding to create more modern and resilient airport infrastructure, which could provide sustained benefits for non-residential construction activity.
Residential
We estimate that approximately 22% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were directly related to clean water and wastewater infrastructure projects to supply and service U.S. residential construction activity. Residential spending in our industry is driven by new land and lot development for single-family housing. U.S. residential construction activity has accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to grow as a result of population growth, low housing inventory, affordable interest rates and demographic population shifts. The current under-build of housing in the U.S. compared with household formations implies significant pent-up demand and continued growth going forward.
Our Strategies
We intend to capitalize on our competitive strengths to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value through the following core strategies:
Utilize Scale and Platform to Accelerate New Product Adoption
We utilize our vast geographic footprint, customer relationships, local industry knowledge and training capabilities to introduce and accelerate the adoption of new products and technology in our industry. Examples include the advancement of smart metering and fusible HDPE solutions to waterworks customers, fabrication and kitting assemblies for fire protection contractors and new water retention and erosion control products for residential and non-residential developers. 
We have identified a number of underpenetrated product categories in large and attractive markets where we can grow and enhance our market share. Erosion control is representative of these opportunities as it is a complementary product offering to existing customers in a fragmented market and furthers our focus on clean water given its role in stormwater run-off prevention. We believe that we can expand our presence in these underpenetrated product categories without investing significant capital or incurring substantial incremental costs as a result of our existing branch network, favorable supplier relationships and low working capital requirements.
Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We have a strong track record of acquiring and integrating businesses. We have executed 16 acquisitions since becoming an independent company in 2017, adding more than $645 million in annualized net sales. We take a disciplined approach to sourcing, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses that help us expand into new geographic areas, acquire key talent or offer new products and services. We have a strong acquisition platform in place, which bolsters our ability to pursue attractive assets in the market. Our experienced mergers and acquisitions team actively develops a large pipeline of synergistic acquisition targets and coordinates with field leadership to identify, pursue and integrate new businesses. Through favorable purchasing capabilities, overhead cost reduction, facility optimization and our scalable information technology platform, we have been able to generate significant margin improvement and synergistic value from our acquired businesses.
We believe we are widely viewed as the acquirer of choice in our industry due to our long-standing relationships, an entrepreneurial culture, and our investment in the development and well-being of our people.
Replicate Successful Expansion in Underpenetrated Geographies
We have demonstrated an ability to successfully expand in underpenetrated geographies. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to strengthen our presence in metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) where we have an established footprint as well as in certain underserved markets. We believe we are well-positioned to do so through our market intelligence and ability to attract and develop sales talent. We also intend to continue to selectively drive greenfield expansion. We believe we can efficiently open new branches in geographies with attractive market trends given our highly capable talent pool, ability to capitalize on our scale and learning curve advantages based on past successes in entering new geographies. We have identified over 170 MSAs where we believe we are underpenetrated and thus have opportunities to pursue greenfield expansion or offer more product lines and services.
Increase Penetration with Strategic Accounts
Through our strategic accounts program, we partner with national contractors and private water companies who typically pursue large-scale, complex projects that require greater technical expertise and specialized procurement needs. Sales through our strategic accounts program represented less than 5% of our fiscal 2021 net sales. We believe that we are well-positioned to grow our share with these customers due to our dedicated sales team that includes engineers and other experts who can provide significant insights on large, complex projects, including cases in which our customers are asked to design and build new water systems or wastewater treatment plans. Our partnerships with these customers extend throughout the entire project lifecycle, from the pre-bidding design phase to post-project support. We believe our strategic partnerships and national supplier relationships will continue to generate cross-selling opportunities and future business, while driving adoption within our distribution model.
Execute on Gross Margin Enhancement Initiatives
From the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019 (“fiscal 2018”) to fiscal 2021, our gross margin has improved by roughly 350 basis points in part through several initiatives, including our private label program, category management optimization, data-driven pricing strategies and an expansion of value-added products and services. We have complemented these initiatives with accretive acquisitions, which has resulted in sustained margin expansion.
Our private label initiative has accelerated since our acquisition of Long Island Pipe Supply, Inc. ("LIP"), through which we gained access to a highly scalable assortment of private brands and products utilized throughout the fire protection product line. We believe our ability to leverage our global sourcing capabilities and strong international supplier relationships, as well as the potential for automated distribution and logistics, will continue to create competitive pricing advantages. We are expanding our direct sourcing and distribution capabilities in order to drive further margin expansion in the future.
Our category management team has identified numerous opportunities to continue shifting spend to suppliers with the best pricing and payment programs in order to optimize supplier incentives to expand gross margins.
Additionally, we have a specialized team dedicated to driving sustainable margin improvement through pricing analytics. An end-to-end review of our pricing strategies identified key margin enhancement opportunities, including continued optimization of system-wide pricing through IT enhancements, data-driven customer and product analysis that enable us to identify price opportunities and mitigate potential margin impacts from price changes. We believe these gross margin initiatives, in addition to our ability to leverage fixed costs, create a path to drive continued EBITDA margin expansion over the long term.
Invest in Attracting, Retaining and Developing World-Class Talent
We believe that our continued investment in the development and well-being of our people, together with our focus on our foundational core values of honesty and integrity, support our commitment to our associates and to customer service. Our award-winning training programs enable us to accelerate development of our top talent to drive profitable growth while maintaining a supportive and mission-driven culture.
We intend to continue investing our already strong talent base by attracting and developing associates. Our training and leadership curricula and expanded diversity and inclusion programs drive high associate engagement and a positive associate experience. In addition, we deliver attractive career growth opportunities to our associates while leveraging their knowledge and expertise.
Our Products & Services
Our comprehensive product portfolio consists of over 200,000 SKUs from approximately 4,500 suppliers. Our offering consists of pipes, valves & fittings, storm drainage and erosion control solutions, fire protection products and fabrication services, and smart metering products, services and technology. Our customers value our product breadth and geographic reach, as well as our technical product knowledge and consultation services. While pricing is important to our customers, availability, convenience, reliability and expertise are also important factors in their purchase decisions. In addition to many of our other capabilities, our ability to coordinate the logistics of on-time, last-mile jobsite delivery provides us with a competitive advantage over many competitors who offer a more limited selection of services.
Pipes, Valves & Fittings
Pipe, valves, hydrants and fittings are used in the distribution and flow control of water within water and wastewater transmission networks. Our pipe products, which typically range in diameter from 1/2” to 60”, include materials such as PVC, ductile iron, fusible high-density polyethylene, steel and copper tubing. Our valves are used to control the flow of water within water transmission networks and are often custom engineered to meet the specific needs of each project. Our hydrants provide a point-of-access for fire fighters to quickly tap into pressurized water systems and vary based on local specifications and regulations. Our fittings and restraints, made from a variety of materials depending on local specifications and regulations, are used to connect pipe sections, valves and other devices to each other. This category also includes other complementary products and services used for the service and repair of underground water infrastructure.
Pipes, valves & fittings products accounted for approximately 67% of our net sales in fiscal 2021.
Storm Drainage
Our storm drainage products are used in the construction of stormwater and erosion control management systems to retain, detain and divert stormwater runoff. Our storm drainage product offering includes corrugated HDPE and metal piping systems, retention basins, inline drains, manholes, grates and other related products. Our storm drainage product offering varies by market depending on local codes and engineering specifications.
Storm drainage products accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2021.
Fire Protection
Our fire protection products are installed in industrial, commercial, institutional and warehouse buildings and are used to extinguish and prevent the spread of fires. These products are typically installed at later stages of the construction cycle than many of our other products, and as these products are generally installed indoors, the installation process can be completed in cold weather months and therefore have seasonality characteristics that offset some of our other product offerings. Typical fire protection products include pipe, sprinkler heads and devices, fire suppression systems, accessories and specialty fabrication services. Our fire protection products meet strict quality standards, and our offering often varies by market based on local specifications, regulations and fire codes.
Fire protection products accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales in fiscal 2021.
Meters
Our smart meters are used for water volume measurement and regulation and include automated meter reading and advanced metering infrastructure technologies. We offer multi-stage smart metering solutions to our customers, including meter installation, network infrastructure and software installation, training and long-term service contracts to deliver cost efficiencies to our customers. Our smart meters and advanced metering technology provide labor savings benefits for our municipal customers and help reduce water loss through leak detection.
Meter products accounted for approximately 8% of our net sales in fiscal 2021.
Our Customers
We have a fragmented customer base that consists of over 60,000 customers. Our top 50 customers represented approximately 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, with our largest customer accounting for less than 1% of net sales. We have long-tenured relationships with our customers, as approximately 84% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were to customers that purchased products from us in each of the last five years, and we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from our existing customers in the future. 
Our customers choose us for our breadth of products and services, extensive industry knowledge, familiarity with local specifications, convenient branch locations, and timely and reliable delivery. We utilize our deep supply chain relationships to provide customers with a “one-stop-shop” experience and customized support in their efforts to maintain and construct water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection systems. Our scale and geographic footprint allows us to obtain preferred access to products for our customers, even during periods of material shortages. We have the ability to serve both smaller, local customers and larger, national customers with relevant expertise and the right inventory on hand. Our local sales associates take a consultative sales approach, using knowledge of the local regulatory requirements and specifications to provide customer-specific product and service solutions. We are deeply involved in our customers’ planning processes, and we have the ability to support our customers by converting engineered drawings and specifications into accurate and comprehensive material project plans. For specific smart metering, treatment plant, storm drainage and erosion control, or fusible pipe solutions, our sales associates partner with a deep and dedicated team of nearly 200 national and regional product specialists to assist customers in project scoping and specialized product selection. Our technical knowledge and experience are complemented by our proprietary customer facing digital technology tools, which enable us to work closely and efficiently with our customers in material management, timely inventory purchasing, quoting and coordinated jobsite delivery. We believe our customer facing technology tools build customer loyalty and drive repeat business, and also create a competitive advantage over smaller competitors who may not have the scale or resources to provide similar technology or services.
Our Suppliers
We have a diverse base of suppliers who view us as integral partners in the supply chain. We have strong relationships with our suppliers due to our long history in the industry, substantial purchasing scale, national footprint and ability to reach a fragmented customer base. Our national footprint and reach to local communities is essential to our suppliers, as we have a highly developed understanding of the relevant market, customer base and growth opportunities. We believe we are one of the largest volume customers for many of our suppliers, leading to favorable purchasing arrangements regarding product availability, payment terms and pricing. Our scale also enables us to secure distribution rights that are either exclusive or given to a limited number of distributors in key product categories, and to provide key products to customers that are unavailable to our competitors. Our size and scale, supplier relationships, and technical knowledge of products and local specifications enable us to obtain preferred access to specialized products and preferred access to products during periods of material shortages, or when shorter-than-usual lead times are required for certain projects. This provides us with a competitive advantage versus smaller competitors, particularly for large and complex projects. Our largest single supplier represented 7% of product expenditures in fiscal 2021, and our top ten suppliers represented 42% of total product expenditures during the same period. We strategically conduct business with our top suppliers in order to optimize our scale advantages, but we also have the flexibility to source the majority of our products from a number of alternate suppliers when necessary.
Our Competition
The U.S. water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products wholesale distribution industry, and the end markets we serve, are highly fragmented. We face competition on a national level from only one other national distributor, but we are unique in our dedicated focus on the water sector. The remainder of our market is served by hundreds of regional, local and specialty niche distributors, and through direct sales by manufacturers to end users. We estimate that our net sales accounted for approximately 16% of our $32 billion addressable market in fiscal 2021, and that we and our largest national competitor had a similar market share in fiscal 2021. 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include the breadth, availability and pricing of products and services, technical knowledge and project planning capabilities, local expertise, as well as delivery capability and reliability. We believe that we are a leader in the local markets that we serve, and our national scale gives us meaningful competitive advantages compared to our smaller competitors.
Our Operating Structure
We strategically organize our branch network to meet the specific needs of our customers in each local market, and we support our branches with the resources of a large company, delivered through district and regional management, including company-wide sales, operations and back-office functions. We believe this allows each local branch manager to tailor his or her branch’s strategy, marketing and product and service offerings to address the needs of customers in each of their markets, while maintaining many of the benefits of our company’s scale. Our branch associates have the opportunity to earn competitive compensation through our performance-based compensation plans, which are based on local performance.
We support our network of approximately 300 branches with the following company-wide resources: strategic accounts, product specialists, category management, sourcing, supply chain, finance, tax, accounting, pricing analytics, payroll, marketing communications, human resources, legal, safety and information technology. Nearly all of our branches operate on an integrated technology platform, allowing us to utilize our combined capabilities for procurement, inventory management, financial support, data analytics and performance reporting.
Our branch operational structure is organized by region and then by district to optimize both the oversight and sharing of resources and products. Each region is led by a regional vice president who manages a multistate territory. This regional structure enables us to address the specific management, strategic and operational needs of each region.
Our Distribution Network
Our branch-based business model is the core of our operations and the primary component of our distribution network. Our branches are strategically located near our customers and vary in size depending on local demand and customer needs. Our branches average approximately 10 associates and include branch management, sales representatives, warehouse staff and other support staff. In our larger branches, the staff may also include a sales manager, purchasing manager or estimator. Each branch carries approximately 4,500 SKUs on average, with many of them on hand as inventory and the rest available for delivery. Our branch managers have the autonomy to optimize their product and service offerings based on the local specifications, regulations and customer preferences within each local market.
Our branch network connects large suppliers with smaller volume customers whose consumption patterns tend to make them uneconomical to be served directly by our suppliers. Our branches receive products in both large and small quantities from our suppliers and stock products in warehouses and yards for purchase. Our specialized fleet of delivery equipment allows us to deliver materials to our customers’ worksites in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 
We also offer direct distribution options to our customers on a wide range of products. This value-added service includes logistics and sourcing for larger products and quantities between our suppliers and our customers, which we believe helps our customers with inventory management and delivery scheduling, particularly when working on large-scale projects with multiple phases and delivery schedules. Contractors work with our sales teams throughout all phases of the project life cycle, including estimating and material “take-off,” product sourcing and bid preparation through delivery. Leveraging our vast supplier network, we are able to arrange convenient direct shipment to jobs, which can be aligned to each phase of the project.
Our Sales Force
As of January 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,600 sales representatives, the majority of whom were inside sales representatives based at local branches. Inside sales representatives are responsible for project management, coordinating incoming orders, providing estimates and ordering material. Our sales representatives also include approximately 525 field sales representatives who directly support customers outside of local branches. These field sales representatives remain attuned to activity in their local market, identifying and tracking active projects, and are responsible for generating sales and identifying new customers and projects. They also directly assist and educate customers, taking a consultative approach and helping with custom projects and product solutions tailored to our customers’ needs. While our sales representatives are typically assigned to a local branch and report to a branch manager, they can service an entire district and report to a district manager based on a specific customer or project need and the size of the branch. 
Our sales representatives are highly experienced with in-depth product and technical knowledge, significant local insights and strong long-term customer relationships, all of which are critical to our success. On average, our field sales representatives have over 10 years of experience in the water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection industry. Our sales approach is highly consultative, as our representatives are often deeply involved in our customers’ processes and assist in project scoping, product selection and materials management. Our sales force also includes a deep and dedicated team of nearly 200 technical product specialists at the national and regional levels who have expertise in specific product and service offerings, and who support our other sales representatives with product training and technical support. 
Our Human Capital
We believe our associates are the key drivers of our success, and we are focused on attracting, training, promoting and retaining industry-leading talent. Our authentic, purpose-driven culture enables our associates to thrive in our company and our industry. We have a strong track record of developing our associates for success and driving high employee engagement. Our ability to attract and retain talent is based on four foundational pillars: pay for performance, training and development, diversity and inclusion and benefits. 
As of January 30, 2022, we employed approximately 4,100 associates, including approximately 250 in branch management positions, 1,200 in branch operations, 1,600 in sales positions, 500 in warehouse positions and 550 in other positions supporting the company. Approximately 100 of our associates were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements for 46 of these associates will expire in 2022.
Pay for Performance
We believe that our strong culture, consistent investment in our people and competitive compensation programs result in low turnover rates among our associates. Sales associates have the opportunity to earn competitive compensation through our performance-based compensation structure, which aligns our interests with those of our associates. Our leadership incentive programs link compensation levels to the achievement of branch or region-specific goals based on profitability and return on investment. Our “local business, nationwide” philosophy incentivizes both our sales force and our operations team to be entrepreneurial, making decisions grounded in a customer-centric approach. Most other associates also participate in a profit sharing plan that aligns their compensation to profitability and return on investment.
Training and Development
Our associates are the most essential resource to our company. Their knowledge, expertise and growth are critical to our company’s success. We believe that our continued investment in the development and well-being of our people, and our focus on our foundational core values of honesty and integrity, support our commitment to hands-on customer service. At Core & Main, our associates develop by learning from the best of the best—on the job, in our national learning center, through in-house subject matter experts and with virtual and online academies.
Our learning team offers a wide range of award-winning training programs and courses such as sales, operations, product expertise, leadership, management and safety. We also provide customized training, talent reviews and early career rotational programs for college graduates to develop as future leaders. We utilize our suppliers to enhance our knowledge base as new products and best practices are continually rolled out.
This talent-first approach enables us to develop and promote top talent to drive profitable growth while maintaining a supportive and mission-driven culture. Year after year, associates rate our learning opportunities as one of the most valuable aspects of working at Core & Main.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe our diversity and inclusion efforts are critical to the success of our talent strategy. A core element of our mission is to build strong relationships with one another and in the communities we serve. Some of our efforts are well established, such as our Women’s Network, and are intended to develop women in our industry. More recently, we have created an internal diversity and inclusion advisory group, a mental health council, and an associate caring fund. Through our training programs, we are taking a proactive approach to grow and retain our own talent and develop more diverse leaders in our industry. In fiscal 2020, we began to access new talent pipelines to attract talent from diverse and underrepresented communities, as well as the military. We frequently check the pulse of our associates, in addition to our annual engagement survey to listen and act on feedback. This ongoing, two-way dialogue provides our associates with a voice in creating and improving our culture, and the overall associate experience. We believe being included and having a voice is vital for associate engagement and underscores our core principle: Team members are family.
Benefits
Our comprehensive benefits program, “Live Well,” reflects our overall belief that benefits should address the whole associate experience, including health and well-being. We offer associates a comprehensive benefits package, which includes access to a concierge service to help them navigate their benefits. These efforts are representative of our focus on promoting a consistent, positive experience for all associates.
Our Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks, trade names and licenses to maintain and improve our competitive position. We believe that we have the trademarks, trade names and licenses necessary for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it. We rely on both trademark registration and common law protection for trademarks. Trademark rights may potentially extend indefinitely and are dependent upon national laws and our continued use of the trademarks.
Except for the Core & Main trademark and licenses of commercially available third-party software, we do not consider our trademarks, trade names or licenses to be material to the operation of our business taken as a whole. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks and may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to penalties, fines or various forms of civil, administrative, or criminal actions, any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.
These federal, state, and local laws and regulations include laws relating to wage and hour, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, workers’ safety, transportation, tax, business with disadvantaged business enterprises, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental and associate benefits.
Our facilities and operations are subject to a broad range of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including those relating to the release of hazardous materials into the environment, the emission or discharge of pollutants or other substances into the air, water, or otherwise into the environment, the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination and the protection of the health and safety of our associates.
Our failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws may result in fines, penalties and other sanctions as well as liability for response costs, property damages and personal injuries resulting from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and capital expenditures required to meet regulatory requirements is not currently anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position. New laws or changes in or new interpretations of existing laws, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of other environmental, health or safety liabilities or obligations in the future may lead to additional compliance or other costs, which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.
