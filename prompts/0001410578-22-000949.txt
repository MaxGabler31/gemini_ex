ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
StoneBridge Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in February 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Form 10-K as an initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate an initial business combination.
On July 20, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A ordinary share”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, pursuant to Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreements, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 8,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to StoneBridge Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), and the representative of the underwriters Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”). 7,000,000 Private Placement Warrants were sold to the Sponsor and 1,000,000 Private Placement Warrants were sold to Cantor. The Private Placement Warrants were sold at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,000,000. The sale of the Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants is collectively referred to as the “IPO”.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except as otherwise disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Our initial shareholder, which is our Sponsor, owns an aggregate of 5,000,000 Class B ordinary shares (or “founder shares”), which will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to the adjustments described herein. Prior to an initial business combination, only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the appointment and removal of directors. Holders of our Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment or removal of directors during such time. On any other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, holders of the Class B ordinary shares and holders of the Class A ordinary shares will vote together as a single class, except as otherwise required by law.
A total of $202,000,000, comprised of the proceeds from the IPO after expenses and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“CST”), acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, and up to $100,000 of interest that may be needed to pay dissolution expenses, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months, as applicable) from the July 20, 2021 closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholder’s rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months, as applicable) from the July 20, 2021 closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

The Company has 15 months from the July 20, 2021 closing of the IPO to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate an initial business combination within 15 months from the July 20, 2021 closing of the IPO, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination); provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on July 15, 2021 and incorporated as an exhibit hereto by reference, the only way to extend the time available for the Company to consummate its initial business combination is for the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,000,000 ($0.05 per share, or an aggregate of $2,000,000 if both extension options are exercised), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. In the event that the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees elect to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposit the applicable amount of money into trust, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that the Company is unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. In the event that the Company receives notice from the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees five days prior to the applicable deadline of its intent to effect an extension, the Company intends to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, the Company intends to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether the funds had been timely deposited. Neither the Sponsor nor its affiliates or designees are obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for the Company to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of the parties decide to extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination, such parties may deposit the entire amount required.
General
While we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we are focusing our search on a target with operations or prospective operations in the consumer technology, communications, software, SaaS, fintech or media sectors, which we refer to as the “new economy sectors”. In addition, we are focusing our search for target businesses in the following key verticals: Ecommerce, Fintech, SaaS (Software as a Service), Renewable Energy and Information Technology (IT) and IT Enabled Services. Our geographic focus is Asia Pacific, with a special emphasis on targets in India.
India is entering a new era of economic growth, particularly in the new economy sectors, which we expect will result in attractive initial business combination opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns. We are focusing our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $600 million and $1.5 billion, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered.
Our Management Team
In order to achieve our objective of acquiring the right Indian or other company, we have assembled a group of officers and directors who have experience in the public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets, both in India and the United States.
Our management team has served as directors, and in executive and advisory capacities, for publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures, corporate strategy and implementation, and both cross border (India-U.S.) and U.S. initial public offerings. We believe our management team’s background provides us with the ability to source transactions and identify companies that can thrive in a public-listing environment. We believe this experience is a significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates for a potential initial business combination. Additionally, over the course of their careers, our management team, board and advisors have developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships, which we believe provides us with an important source of transaction opportunities, although there can be no assurance of this.
We are sourcing potential deals through the relationships of our management team and advisory council. Leveraging our industry knowledge and our vast network of contacts, we are confident in our proprietary sourcing of deal flow to originate and complete an acquisition. Such network includes investment bank, private equity, and hedge fund relationships. We anticipate that our relationships are instrumental to our plan to complete an initial business combination within our 15-month (or up to 21-month, as applicable) timeframe.

Acquisition Strategy
While we may pursue an initial business combination with a company in any sector, we are focusing our search on the new economy sectors and related businesses, which complements the expertise of our officers, directors, and advisors. We believe the new economy sectors have been poised for significant growth starting in 2021 and will last for years to come.
Investment Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any or all of these criteria and guidelines.

● | Sustainable Earnings with Significant Growth: We are looking to acquire a business that has an established market share, consistent cash flow, and significant growth potential.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public Market Reception: During the acquisition process, we are placing strong emphasis on the viability of the business to operate within the public markets, and additionally, the reception the markets will provide for the business we select. Our goal is to find a company that generates public market enthusiasm once an acquisition is announced.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Barriers to Entry: We are looking at what, if any, barriers to entry there are for new competitors to come into the market or for current competitors to offer similar products. Ideally, the company we select will have a high barrier to entry, enabling stronger competitive advantages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Advantages: We are examining the competitive advantages potential target companies have established within their industry, and how these advantages may enable the business to gain excess market share, higher margins, higher demand, among other advantages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public Markets Management Team: We are searching for a company that will have a management team ready for the public markets and that can operate with our team as advisors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leveraging our management team’s experiences: We are searching for a business that will complement our team’s expertise and enable our team to contribute significant value to its operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other criteria: In evaluating prospective targets, we may also consider criteria such as general financial condition, capital requirements, internal structure, corporate governance, the impact of current and future regulations, licensing and other market and geographic-specific conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to an initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.

10



Effecting a business combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our IPO. We intend to effectuate an initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO, our shares, new debt, proceeds from the new issuance of securities, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in an initial business combination. We may seek to consummate an initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate an initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations, except for our pursuit of an initial business combination .
If an initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions or purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating an initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We have not entered into any definitive agreement with any acquisition target. From the period prior to our formation through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no communications, evaluations or discussions between any of our officers, directors or our co-sponsors and any of their contacts or relationships regarding a potential initial business combination. We have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate. Subject to the requirement that an initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete an initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of an initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with an initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Sources of Target Businesses
While we may pursue an initial business combination with a company in any sector, we are focusing our search on the new economy sectors and related businesses, which complements the expertise of our officers, directors, and advisors. We believe the new economy sectors were poised for significant growth beginning in 2021 and lasting for years to come. Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 20, 2021 relating to our IPO (Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-253641) (as amended, the “Registration Statement”) initially filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021).

11



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct due diligence that encompasses, among other things, (i) meetings with incumbent management and their advisors (if applicable); (ii) document reviews; (iii) interviews with various stakeholders, including, but not limited to, employees, customers and suppliers; (iv) on-site inspection of facilities; and (v) reviewing financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us.
Our acquisition criteria, due diligence processes, and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to an initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
Nasdaq rules require that an initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with an initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. Our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to an initial business combination.
If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from either (i) an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, (ii) another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire, or (iii) an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We might purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with an initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. We have also agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor. Subject to these requirements, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate an initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for an initial business combination, there is intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination and our issued and outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Management Operating and Investment Experience
In order to achieve our objectives of acquiring the right Indian or other company, we have assembled a group of officers and directors who have experience in the public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets, both in India and the United States.

12



Our management team has served as directors, and in executive and advisory capacities, for publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures, corporate strategy and implementation, and both cross border (India-U.S.) and U.S. initial public offerings. We believe our management team’s background provides us with the ability to source transactions and identify companies that can thrive in a public-listing environment. We believe this experience is a significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates and for a potential initial business combination. Additionally, over the course of their careers, our management team, board and advisors have developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships, which we believe will provide us with an important source of transaction opportunities, although there can be no assurance of this.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they will devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed an initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for an initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing a potential transaction with a target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls.
