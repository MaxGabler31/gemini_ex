ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Rosehill Resources Inc. (the “Company,” “Rosehill Resources,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. Our assets are concentrated in the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. We have drilling locations in ten distinct formations in the Delaware Basin in:

l | Brushy Canyon | l | Wolfcamp A (X/Y)
l | Upper and Lower Avalon | l | Lower Wolfcamp A
l | 2nd and 3rd Bone Spring Shale | l | Wolfcamp B 
l | 2nd and 3rd Bone Spring Sand | | 

Our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling in the Delaware Basin. We have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership interest in Rosehill Operating Company, LLC (“Rosehill Operating:), an entity for which we act as the sole managing member and of whose common units we currently own approximately 31.6% (or 43.1% assuming the conversion of Rosehill Operating Series A preferred units into Rosehill Operating common units). 
Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant (“Public Warrant”), were issued in our initial public offering. Our Class A Common Stock Public Warrants and Units trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbols “ROSE,” “ROSEW,” and “ROSEU,” respectively.
Presentation of Financial and Operating Data
On April 27, 2017, the Company was formed when KLR Energy Acquisition Corporation (“KLRE”) acquired a portion of the equity interests of Rosehill Operating, an entity into which Tema Oil & Gas Company (“Tema”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Rosemore, Inc. (“Rosemore”), contributed certain assets and liabilities (the “Transaction”). Following the Transaction, KLRE changed its name to Rosehill Resources Inc. and became the sole managing member of Rosehill Operating.
The consolidated financial results of the Company consist of the financial results of Rosehill Resources, Inc. and Rosehill Operating, its consolidated subsidiary. Because Tema had effective control of the combined company before and after the consummation of the Transaction on April 27, 2017 through its majority voting interest in Rosehill Operating and the Company, respectively, the Transaction was structured as a reverse recapitalization. As a result, the reports filed by the Company subsequent to the Transaction are prepared “as if” Rosehill Operating is the predecessor and legal successor to the Company. The historical operations of Rosehill Operating are deemed to be those of the Company. Thus, the financial statements included in this report reflect:

• | the historical operating results of Rosehill Operating prior to the Transaction;


• | the combined results of the Company and Rosehill Operating following the Transaction;


• | the assets and liabilities of Rosehill Operating at their historical cost; and the Company’s equity and earnings per share for all periods presented.

(5) | In connection with the conversion of our remaining Series A Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock, the Rosehill Operating Series A Preferred Units owned by us will convert into Rosehill Operating Common Units and, on an as-converted basis, we will own approximately 43% of the Rosehill Operating Common Units.

Our Business

We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and is comprised of three primary sub-basins; the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform and the Delaware Basin. Since the sale of our Barnett Shale assets during the fourth quarter of 2017, our assets are concentrated within the Delaware Basin, and we divide our operations into two core areas: the Northern Delaware Basin and the Southern Delaware Basin. 
9

Our sole material asset is our interest in Rosehill Operating. As the sole managing member of Rosehill Operating, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Rosehill Operating’s business without the approval of any other member, unless otherwise specified in the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Rosehill Operating (the “Second Amended LLC Agreement”).
Our management team has significant experience identifying, acquiring and developing unconventional oil and natural gas assets with the objective of being a returns-oriented pure-play Delaware Basin company focusing on (i) acreage with reduced development risk as a result of being in proven areas within the vicinity of other successful wells, (ii) stacked pay zones, including Brushy Canyon, Avalon/1st Bone Spring, 2nd Bone Spring, 3rd Bone Spring, Upper Wolfcamp A (X/Y), Lower Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B and (iii) application of geology, optimizing well process improvements and well returns. We believe these characteristics enhance our horizontal production capabilities, recoveries and economic results.
Recent Events
Class A Common Stock Offering
On September 27, 2018, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), for a public offering of 6,150,000 shares of common stock (the “Class A Common Stock Offering”) at a public offering price of $6.10 per share ($5.795 per share net of underwriting discount and commissions). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 922,500 shares of Class A Common Stock.
On October 2, 2018, upon the closing of the Class A Common Stock Offering, we issued 6,150,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. Our net proceeds from the Class A Common Stock Offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs, was $34.5 million. On October 5, 2018, the Underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 840,744 shares of Class A Common Stock at the Underwriters’ price of $5.795 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million for the shares of Class A Common Stock sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters’ option. We contributed all of the net proceeds from the Class A Common Stock Offering and the exercise of the Underwriters’ option to Rosehill Operating in exchange for Rosehill Operating Common Units.
Farm-In Agreement
In March 2019, we executed a farm-in agreement with Jagged Peak Energy covering the right to earn an interest in a strategic block in the Southern Delaware Basin. The farm-in agreement allows us to earn up to approximately 2,200 net acres upon drilling and completing up to seven wells through 2020. We will provide a 25% carry of drilling and completion costs for each of the seven wells, along with facilities equipment.
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On March 28, 2018, Rosehill Operating entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) by and among Rosehill Operating, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, as lenders. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to provide Rosehill Operating with a $500 million secured reserve-based revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $150 million. The first redetermination date occurred on June 29, 2018, increasing the borrowing base from $150 million to $210 million and then it was increased to $220 million on December 5, 2018. On March 28, 2019, the borrowing base was increased to $300 million.
Our Operations
We operate in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas, and all of our operations are conducted in the United States. Consequently, we currently report a single reportable segment. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about this reportable segment. Our future development will be focused predominately on horizontal development drilling in both our core acreage areas in the Northern Delaware Basin and the Southern Delaware Basin. We currently have two horizontal rigs under contract of less than one year.
Since 2012, we have drilled 71 gross horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware Basin and 8 gross horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin with a continuing drop in drilling times and an increase in operational capabilities and efficiencies. In 2018, our production was approximately 18,337 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 214% as compared to 
10

the daily average of 2017. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 67 gross operated producing horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware Basin and 4 gross operated producing horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin, as well as working interests in approximately 6,665 gross acres in the Northern Delaware Basin and 9,219 gross acres in the Southern Delaware Basin.
As of December 31, 2018, we have identified 513 gross operated and 53 gross non-operated potential horizontal drilling locations in the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, including 44 locations associated with proved undeveloped reserves, in up to ten formations from Brushy Canyon down through the Wolfcamp B. We believe that development drilling of our identified gross operated potential horizontal drilling locations, together with an increased focus on maximizing the value of existing assets by optimizing completions, reducing horizontal drilling costs, efficiently building out facilities and reducing operating costs will allow us to grow our production and reserves. We also intend to grow our production and reserves through acquisitions that meet certain strategic and financial objectives. 
The table below sets forth our identified potential operated horizontal drilling locations for the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin by formation as of December 31, 2018.

 | Operated Potential Horizontal Drilling Locations (1)(2)(3)
Target Formation: | Gross | Net
Brushy Canyon | 27 | | 24 
Upper Avalon | 13 | | 13 
Lower Avalon / 1st Bone Spring | 83 | | 74 
2nd Bone Spring Shale | 17 | | 17 
2nd Bone Spring Sand | 59 | | 55 
3rd Bone Spring Shale | 19 | | 19 
3rd Bone Spring Sand | 57 | | 49 
Wolfcamp A (X/Y) | 15 | | 15 
Lower Wolfcamp A | 68 | | 57 
Wolfcamp B | 155 | | 137
Total Horizontal Locations (4) | 513 | | 460


(1) | Our inventory of gross operated potential horizontal drilling locations assumes four to six wells per 640-acre section within each of the ten formations, with the number of prospective formations varying from tract to tract depending on the geology of the specific area.


(2) | Our estimated drilling locations are based on well spacing assumptions and the evaluation of our horizontal drilling results as well as results of other operators in the area, combined with our interpretation of available geologic and engineering data. In particular, we have analyzed and interpreted well results and other data acquired through our participation in the drilling of a vertical well that penetrated all of our targeted horizontal formations. In addition, to evaluate the prospects of our horizontal acreage, we have performed open-hole and mud log evaluations, core analysis, and drill cuttings analysis and acquired and interpreted modern 3-D seismic data.


(3) | The drilling locations that we actually drill will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these identified potential horizontal drilling locations may not be successful and may not result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our existing proved reserves. Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The identified potential horizontal drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the capital that would be necessary to drill such locations.


(4) | Includes PUDs and unproved locations for our leasehold in the Northern and Southern Delaware Basins.

We expect to drill between 25 and 29 wells in 2019, completing between 24 and 28 wells. As of December 31, 2018, we had 8 drilled uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and expect to exit 2019 with 8 to 10 DUCs. 
11

Our locations
Advanced petrophysical logs from the vertical portions of our wells, sidewall cores and seismic data are being utilized to guide our horizontal development of both the Northern Delaware area and the Southern Delaware area. The use of seismic data has resulted in a better understanding of our leasehold’s geology relative to other parts of the basin. The depth to the top of the Wolfcamp from a representative well central to our Northern Delaware leasehold is approximately 11,500 feet true vertical depth and approximately 9,000 feet true vertical depth in the Southern Delaware. The gross thickness of the potential pay section from the top of the Brushy Canyon formation through the base of the Wolfcamp B is approximately 4,500 feet in the Northern Delaware, an attractive thickness for development with multiple horizontal landing formations. Similarly, the gross thickness of the potential pay thickness from the top of the Bone Spring Lime through the base of the Wolfcamp B in the Southern Delaware is approximately 2,500 feet. We believe that the combination of these conditions will allow us to achieve superior results during the development of our leasehold.
Historically, our horizontal drilling has been widespread across the majority of our lease acreage. We have established commercial production in eight distinct formations in the Northern Delaware Basin in the Upper Avalon, Lower Avalon, 2nd Bone Spring Shale, 2nd Bone Spring Sand, 3rd Bone Spring Sand, Upper Wolfcamp A (X/Y), Lower Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. In addition, offset operators have drilled and are producing in all ten formations, from Brushy Canyon down through the Wolfcamp B, enabling us to evaluate our acreage across various geographic areas and stratigraphic formations. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 64.9% of our total net operated acreage was either held by production or under continuous drilling provisions. Offset operator activity within the 3rd Bone Spring Sand and the Wolfcamp formations as well as our recent successful Wolfcamp drilling program has been a catalyst for Rosehill Operating to generate a development program focused on the 3rd Bone Spring Sand, Upper Wolfcamp A (X/Y), Lower Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B formations in the Northern Delaware. Our development program in the Southern Delaware will focus largely on the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B formations. We will closely monitor this offset activity and adjust our future development plans with information and best practices learned from other operators.

Completion design and our effective execution are the predominant factors that dictate relative well performance in an area or zone. We have an evolving completion strategy that includes methodical adjustments of parameters, testing of different well designs on adjacent locations with similar rock characteristics, constant monitoring and re-evaluation of results and ultimately tailoring completions to the conditions specific to an area or formation. Our current base completion design is a hybrid fracture stimulation-a combination of slickwater and cross-linked gel. The field-level rate of return is most influenced by incremental improvements in well performance and cost savings; our philosophy is to focus on both parameters, with an emphasis on performance enhancement. 
We believe all ten formations represent opportunities across our core acreage in the Northern Delaware with opportunities in six different formations in the Southern Delaware. We plan to target those formations in our future drilling program. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, identified gross potential drilling locations are defined as locations on operated and non-operated leaseholds specifically identified by geologic, engineering and economic assessment. We have estimated our drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and the evaluation of our operated horizontal drilling results as well as results of other operators in our area. Well performances are combined with interpretation of available geologic and engineering data to generate a development model for the assets. In addition, to evaluate the prospects of our horizontal acreage, we have performed open-hole and mud log evaluations, core analysis and drill cuttings analysis. We have also acquired 48 square miles of 3-D seismic data in the Northern Delaware and 110 square miles in the Southern Delaware that has been used to aid in the interpretation of the prospective formations. The availability of local infrastructure, well performance results, subsurface data and other factors that management may deem relevant, such as easement restrictions and state and local regulations, are considered in determining such locations. The locations that we will actually drill will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs and actual drilling results, among other factors.

Based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data, we currently have approximately 513 gross (460 net) identified potential operated horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves.

Operational facilities
Our development plan includes the development of necessary infrastructure to lower our costs and support our drilling schedule and production growth. We expect to accomplish this goal primarily through contractual arrangements with third-party service providers. Our facilities are generally in close proximity to our well locations and include storage tank batteries, oil/natural gas/water separation equipment and artificial lift equipment. A crude oil gathering system and a natural gas gathering system are already in place and functioning. We have sufficient gathering systems and pipeline takeaway capacity to continue ongoing and planned operations into 2019. As we continue to drill and develop our Delaware Basin assets, we expect that additional tank battery, water disposal and intra-field gathering lines will be required. We have agreements in place with third-party natural gas and crude oil purchasers and processors to benefit from existing downstream infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate the marketplace to obtain additional transportation and gathering options and capacity in the form of new pipeline tie-ins.
Major customers 
With respect to the core properties we operate in the Delaware Basin, we maintain contracts with Gateway Gathering and Marketing Company (“Gateway”) (an affiliate of Tema), Targa Delaware, LLC and Targa Crude Pipeline, LLC (collectively, referred to as “Targa”), Plains Pipeline, L.P. (“Plains”) and Brazos Midstream Operating, LLC (“Brazos”) to gather and transport the majority of our production. We deliver crude oil and natural gas to Gateway, Targa, Plains and Brazos and they gather, transport and redeliver the oil and natural gas to certain redelivery points for sale to our customers. Please read the section entitled “Gathering and Transportation” for more detail on our gathering and transportation contracts.
We sell our production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the industry. We sell all of our natural gas and NGLs under contracts with terms generally greater than twelve months and all of our oil under contracts with terms generally less than twelve months. The following table shows the percentage of sales to each of our major customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total oil, natural gas and NGL sales for each year presented. 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

(1) | For a further discussion see Note 15 - Related Party Transactions

The loss of any one or all of our significant customers as a purchaser could materially and adversely affect our revenues in the short-term. However, based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers, we believe that the loss of any of our significant customers as a purchaser would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. 
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGLs and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 87.5%. As of December 31, 2018, 64.9% of our net leasehold acreage was held by production.
13

Gathering and Transportation 
Our oil and natural gas production from our core properties in the Northern Delaware Basin, except the Weber 26 lease, is delivered to our production facilities and then our oil is transported through Gateway’s Raven Gathering System (“Raven”) pipeline to the interconnection between the Raven pipeline and Plains pipeline and our natural gas production is transported through Gateway’s Loving County Gas System (“LCGS”) to the interconnection between LCGS Pipeline and our purchasers. We have a Crude Oil Gathering Agreement and a Gas Gathering Agreement with Gateway that will each expire in April 2027. Upon expiration, each agreement will continue on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party. We do not control Gateway’s gathering facilities.
Our oil and natural gas production from our Weber 26 lease is delivered to our production facilities and then transported through Targa’s crude oil and natural gas pipeline and gathering systems to delivery points specified in the contracts for sale to our customers. We have a five-year Crude Oil Gathering Agreement with Targa, which became effective May 1, 2018, that upon expiration, will continue on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party. We have a five-year Gas Gathering, Processing and Purchase Agreement with Targa, which became effective December 1, 2016, that upon expiration, will continue on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party.
Our natural gas production from our core properties in the Southern Delaware Basin is delivered to our production facilities and then transported through Brazos’ gas gathering system to delivery points specified in the contracts for sale to our customers. We have a fifteen-year Gas Gathering Agreement with Brazos, which became effective October 28, 2015, that upon expiration, will continue on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party.
During the further development of our properties in the Northern and Southern Delaware Basins, we expect to consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure options in the areas of our production. Gateway has a right of first refusal to build gathering and delivery infrastructure for our properties in the Northern Delaware Basin. 
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel, primarily based on price. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and future federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Please see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations - Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.”
14

Seasonality of business
Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. Weather conditions affect the demand for and prices of, oil, natural gas and NGLs. Due to these and other seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations.
Operational hazards and insurance
The oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks, including, but not limited to, the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high-pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 
In accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have insurance policies for certain property damages, control of well protection, general liability, commercial automobile, workers compensation, pollution liability (claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date), excess umbrella liability and other coverages. 
Our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. Any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations - We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or the insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.” 
We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Generally, we also require our third-party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance. Proposals and proceedings that could affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress (“Congress”), the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), other federal agencies and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. However, we do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
15

Regulation of oil and natural gas production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. We own property interests in jurisdictions that regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, reports concerning operations and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the source and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations, including the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that limit or prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws also govern various conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing or density and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing or density. Moreover, many jurisdictions impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation of oil sales and transportation
Sales of oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost‑based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates and regulations regarding access are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. In December 2015, H.R. 2029 was signed into law which lifted a ban on the export of crude oil from the United States. This will enable U.S. oil producers the flexibility to seek new markets and export oil into the global marketplace.
Regulation of natural gas sales and transportation
In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated by FERC primarily under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended (“NGA”) and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations. 
The EP Act of 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior prescribed by FERC Pursuant to the EP Act of 2005, FERC promulgated regulations that make it unlawful to: (i) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, use, or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (ii) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (iii) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the Annual Reporting requirements described below. 
The EP Act of 2005 also provided FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increased FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. Effective January 2018, to account for inflation, FERC’s civil penalty authority was increased to $1,238,271 
16

per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. Under FERC’s regulations, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices, and whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. 
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a case-by-case basis. To the extent that FERC issues an order that reclassifies certain non-jurisdictional gathering facilities as jurisdictional transmission facilities, our costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations could increase. We believe that the third-party natural gas pipelines on which our gas is gathered meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation under the NGA. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of those gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. 
For physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC under the EP Act of 2005 and under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures or derivative contracts on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity, as well as any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures or derivative contract on such commodity. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, they could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship our natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenue we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC or state policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate and intrastate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC or state regulatory bodies will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect our operations in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers and marketers with which we compete.

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to occupational health and safety, or the protection of the environment and natural resources. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future. 
Regulation of hazardous substances and waste handling 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Although petroleum substances such as crude oil and natural gas are excluded from the definition of hazardous substances under CERCLA, various substances used in drilling and production operations are not covered by this exclusion and releases of these non-excluded substances or petroleum substances could give rise to CERCLA liability. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances or petroleum released into the environment. We are only able to directly control the operation of those wells for which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the liability of an operator other than us for releases may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, but we are unaware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws impose detailed requirements for the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. RCRA specifically excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, in the course of our operations, we may generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics or are listed hazardous wastes. In addition, even wastes excluded from the definition of hazardous waste may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under state laws or other federal laws. Moreover, it is possible that those particular oil and natural gas development and production wastes now excluded from the definition of hazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, from time to time various environmental groups have challenged the EPA’s exclusion of certain oil and gas wastes from regulations RCRA. In one such challenge, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a consent decree requiring EPA to evaluate the exclusion and, by March 2019, to either sign a notice of proposed rulemaking revising the regulations excluding oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the exclusion is not necessary. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes, if the EPA were to eliminate the exclusion, could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant, we do not believe that our costs in this regard are materially more burdensome than those for similarly situated companies. 
18

We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas development and production activities for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property, or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Regulation of water discharges
The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into or near navigable waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”). In September 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued new rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act with respect to certain types of waterbodies and classifying these waterbodies as regulated wetlands. The 2015 rule was previously stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases challenging the new rules. The EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts; following which, the previously-filed district court cases were allowed to proceed. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years while the agencies reconsidered the rule. Multiple states and environmental groups challenged the stay and a federal judge barred the agencies’ suspension of the rule in August 2018. Separately, a federal court in Georgia enjoined implementation of the rule in eleven states. However, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps released a proposed rule that would replace the 2015 rule and significantly reduce the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. Such proposal is currently subject to public review and comment, after which additional legal challenges are anticipated. As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the 2015 rule is uncertain. To the extent any revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. 
In addition, pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” for on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We believe that we maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations and further believe we are in substantial compliance with the terms thereof. 
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. Owners or operators of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge is one type of “responsible party” who is liable. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Regulation of air emissions
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air 
19

emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. In November 2017, the EPA published a list of areas that are in compliance with the new ozone standard and, separately in December 2017, issued responses to state recommendations for designating non-attainment areas. States had the opportunity to submit new air quality monitoring to the EPA prior to the EPA finalizing its non-attainment designations. The EPA issued final attainment status designations in April 2018 and July 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or could delay or limit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
In addition, the EPA has adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”)
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHG present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that otherwise require such permits for non-GHG emissions. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions are also required to meet “best available control technology” standards that are being established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. Furthermore, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rule includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. However, the agency proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to stay the requirements for a period of two years and revisit implementation of these methane standards in their entirety. In September 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 rules that would reduce the 2016 rules’ fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to controlling methane emissions from pneumatic pumps, among other changes. Various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the 2016 rules and the EPA’s attempts to delay the implementation of such rules. As a result of these developments, future implementation of the standards is uncertain at this time. To the extent implemented, compliance with these rules would require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks and increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules would also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third-party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. New rules related to the reduction of methane and other GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.
There have not been significant legislative proposals to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional programs and initiatives have been enacted or are being considered that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs, direct taxation of carbon emissions, or that promote the use of less carbon-intensive fuels. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges from participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
20

Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events. Our operations are onshore and not located in coastal or flood-prone regions of the United States, but if any such effects were to occur at our locations, these effects have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water for our operations and thus could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of hydraulic fracturing 
Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Also, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. 
The EPA has issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. These rules require a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted from these activities by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on new hydraulically-fractured wells. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. 
The EPA has also released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events.
Several states, including Texas, and local jurisdictions, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The Texas Railroad Commission has also adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments also clarify the Texas Railroad Commission’s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells.
21

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
ESA and migratory birds 
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered or proposed for listing are known to exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the Agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The agency missed this deadline and continues to review species for listing under the ESA. Also, in the past, the federal government has issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. However, in December 2017, the Department of Interior issued a new opinion revoking its prior enforcement policy and concluded that an incidental take is not a violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as a critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
OSHA 
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Related Permits and Authorizations
Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for ongoing operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which, in certain cases, can delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 79 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
