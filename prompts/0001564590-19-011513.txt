Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are an ophthalmic device company which has developed and is in the process of obtaining FDA approval for a proprietary optical lens implant for treating presbyopia, the age-related loss of the ability to focus on near objects. Our lens, which we refer to as our microlens, is a miniature lens designed to be surgically implanted in a patient’s eye to improve that patient’s ability to see objects at close distances. Our current strategy is to continue to commercialize our microlens in certain strategic countries where we currently have marketing approval and to obtain FDA approval for our microlens in the United States. Our goal is to become a leading provider of corneal inlay presbyopia-correcting treatment worldwide.
 According to Market Scope, an ophthalmic market research organization, presbyopia is a common vision disorder that affects approximately 1.9 billion people worldwide. Presbyopia is associated with the inability of the eye’s natural lens to change shape, or accommodate, in order to see clearly objects in the near and middle distance ranges. According to Market Scope, the worldwide presbyopic population is expected to grow to approximately 2.1 billion by 2021. We believe that the optimum market for our microlens is the global emmetropic presbyopic market, which as an example, in the U.S., is estimated at 38% of the total U.S. presbyopic market, estimated at 119 million presbyopes. We do not currently have marketing approval in many jurisdictions included in the foregoing global data, which jurisdictions collectively represent a majority of the worldwide presbyopic population, including the United States.
 We believe that our solution offers each of the following benefits: 
  
• | our solution is intended primarily for emmetropic-presbyopes, or those individuals who suffer from presbyopia but do not have any other visual disorder, and it has also been used effectively after laser procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our solution is also intended for plano-presbyopes, those who have had prior lens replacement procedures, and currently seek treatment for presbyopia.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our solution is minimally invasive; our microlens can be implanted and removed in simple, surgical procedures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our solution offers significant near vision improvement with little or no loss of binocular distance visual acuity (the ability to see distant objects with both eyes without prescription enhancement) and minimal risk of adverse side effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our solution offers a wide range of corrective power, from +1.5 diopters to +3.5 diopters, in 0.25 diopter increments (a diopter is a unit of measurement of the optical power of a lens).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | once implanted, our microlens is invisible to the naked eye.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our microlens and the procedure to implant our microlens are not currently reimbursed through private or governmental third-party payors in any country, nor do we anticipate that they will be reimbursable in the foreseeable future. The commercialization of our microlens depends on a prospective patient’s ability to cover the costs of our microlens and the implantation procedure. We believe that a substantial portion of presbyopes worldwide do not have the financial means to cover the costs of our microlens, but we believe that a direct patient pay model enables medical providers to avoid pricing pressure from private or governmental third-party payors.
 Our microlens procedure is performed using a 150 kilohertz or greater frequency femtosecond laser, which is a laser that is currently used in certain LASIK surgeries, cataract surgeries and cornea replacement surgeries. In commercializing our solution, we intend to target those markets with a well-established presence of ophthalmic clinics equipped with femtosecond lasers. We believe that the existing infrastructure in most such ophthalmic clinics is sufficient to make our solution an attractive opportunity for such ophthalmic clinics and our commercialization strategy includes working closely with such ophthalmic clinics to train and qualify ophthalmic surgeons on the use of our solution.

Through our European Union CE Mark, we are generally authorized to market our microlens throughout the European Economic Area (all European Union member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or “EEA”, and, through mutual recognition agreements, in Switzerland. We currently market our microlens in certain strategic EEA countries as well as certain strategic countries outside of the EEA in which we possess marketing approval, such as South Korea. Through March 2019, we have shipped approximately 2,340 of our microlenses to commercial partners outside of the United States, of which ophthalmic surgeons have implanted approximately 1,350. For geographic information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets, please see Note 11 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 
We are presently seeking marketing approval in the United States. In order to commercialize our microlens in the United States, we must first obtain a premarket approval, or “PMA”, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the “FDA”. In December 2013, we received approval to commence a staged pivotal clinical trial as part of the FDA approval process. Beginning in May 2014, we enrolled a total of seventy-five (75) subjects at six (6) investigational sites in the U.S. and each subject underwent insertion of our microlens in the non-dominant eye. Based on nine-month data on fifty-two (52) subjects, in January 2015, we submitted an interim safety report as a supplement to our investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. In February 2015, we received approval from the FDA to commence second stage enrollment in this trial. In September 2015, we completed enrollment of the second stage study of 346 subjects at up to five (5) additional investigational sites. This trial is necessary to obtain clinical data to provide the primary support for a safety and effectiveness evaluation to support a PMA for commercial distribution in the U.S.. Data on a minimum of 300 subjects with 24-month data was to be submitted as part of the PMA, and all subjects were to be followed for three (3) years following implantation. We pursued a modular PMA submission strategy whereby we submitted to the FDA our first module in the second quarter of 2016, containing information regarding biocompatibility. We submitted the second and third modules in the first quarter of 2017, containing information regarding preclinical testing, engineering and manufacturing. We submitted our fourth PMA module, containing 24-month data on 385 subjects, in the second quarter of 2018. Safety and effectiveness data for subjects with 24-month data was submitted as part of the PMA. On October 5, 2018, we received notification from the FDA that 36-month data on all subjects enrolled in our staged pivotal clinical trial, including additional safety and efficacy related information, is required before the FDA can complete its review of our PMA application. On April 3, 2019, the FDA granted an additional extension of time to respond, as we will need additional time to complete the 36-month Clinical Study Report and provide additional safety and efficacy related information requested by the FDA in its October 5, 2018 letter. The extension will provide us an additional 180-day period to respond, and we anticipate (though no assurance can be given) that we will complete the submission of all the requested information before the 180-day extension date of September 30, 2019. It is possible that neither our microlens nor any products we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain a PMA. Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-approval or new clinical studies as a condition of approval.   The Eye and Vision Problems
 The human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of receiving visual images and transmitting them to the visual center in the brain. Among the main parts of the eye are the cornea, the iris, the lens and the retina. The cornea is the clear window in the front of the eye through which light first passes. The interior surface of the cornea is lined with a single layer of flat, tile-like endothelial cells, whose function is to maintain the transparency of the cornea. The iris is a pigmented muscular curtain located behind the cornea that opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening at the center of the iris. The lens, known in medical terminology as the “crystalline lens,” is a clear structure located behind the iris that changes shape, or accommodates, to focus light on the back of the eye. The retina is a layer of nerve tissue in the back of the eye that senses the light image and transmits it to the brain via the optic nerve. The figure below illustrates certain elements of the basic anatomy of the human eye.

The eye may be affected by common visual disorders, disease or trauma. A normal, well-functioning eye receives images of objects at varying distances and focuses the images on the retina. Refractive errors (including myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia and astigmatism, each described below) occur when the eye cannot properly focus an image on the retina. In addition to presbyopia, common vision problems include:
  
• | myopia, or nearsightedness, which occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images in front of the retina;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hyperopia, or farsightedness, which occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | astigmatism, an optical defect in which vision is blurred due to an oval-shaped cornea or, in some cases, an oval-shaped natural lens, producing a distorted image on the retina. Astigmatism may accompany myopia or hyperopia; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cataracts, a clouding of the lens, which worsens with time and gradually occludes incoming light images.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cataracts are mostly age-related, while myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism are not. The most common surgical treatment for myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism is LASIK surgery, in which the surface of the cornea is carefully mapped and then a computerized optical laser uses this mapping to reshape the surface of the cornea by ablation to permit proper focusing. Cataracts are most often treated by surgically removing the affected lens and replacing it with a monofocal or multi-focal intraocular lens (“IOL”).
 Presbyopia is an age-related refractive disorder that generally begins to develop when a person reaches the age of 40. The disorder may go unnoticed for several years after its initial onset and can worsen with age. The first symptoms of presbyopia are typically experienced when a person begins to have difficulty reading fine print. Presbyopia is associated with a loss of lens “elasticity,” the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus incoming light on the retina from objects in near and middle distance ranges. Elasticity is slowly lost as people age, resulting in a slow decrease in the ability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. Presbyopia is a natural part of aging and affects substantially all people at some point in their adult lives.
 Presbyopia Market 
 According to Market Scope, presbyopia currently affects approximately 1.9 billion people worldwide, or approximately 25% of the global population. According to Market Scope, the worldwide presbyopic population is expected to grow to approximately 2.1 billion people by the end of 2021. The global market opportunity for surgical treatment of presbyopia is large and growing due to the aging of the population. Globally, the median age is projected to increase from 29 years in 2011 to 38 years by 2050. Consistent with the expected growth in the worldwide presbyopic population, according to Market Scope, the annual number of presbyopia-correcting surgeries performed globally is expected to increase from approximately 712,000 procedures in 2015 to approximately 1.2 million procedures by 2020. We believe that the optimum market for our microlens is the emmetropic presbyopic market, which, as an example, in the U.S., is estimated at 38% of the total U.S. presbyopic population. We do not have marketing approval in many jurisdictions included in the foregoing global data, which jurisdictions collectively represent a majority of the worldwide presbyopic population. We have marketing approval in a number of strategic countries that we are targeting for commercialization and we are actively seeking marketing approval in the United States.

Approaches for Treating Presbyopia
 Although reading glasses and contact lenses have historically been, and remain, the most common solution for presbyopia, there are significant drawbacks associated with these non-surgical approaches. Eyeglasses can easily be lost, misplaced, broken or scratched and require frequent cleaning. Also, many people wish to avoid the inconvenience of keeping reading glasses close at hand. Contact lenses require daily insertion, removal and maintenance, which can be problematic for an increasingly mobile population and for people living and working in dusty environments or in unsanitary conditions.
 There are presently four surgical correction categories for treating presbyopia:
 Monovision. Monovision treatments correct one eye, typically the dominant eye, for distance vision and correct the other, non-dominant eye for near vision. While monovision may be accomplished through the use of glasses with two different lenses with varying thickness, that approach can cause bothersome symptoms when a person looks through the edges of the glasses. A more typical approach to monovision is the use of two different contact lenses. A more permanent monovision approach is to undergo laser or IOL-based refractive surgeries adapted for presbyopia correction. A significant drawback of monovision surgical treatments is the complexity of achieving additional correction, if vision further deteriorates. Additional drawbacks include occasional patient adaptation issues, whereby patients have difficulty adjusting to the monovision arrangement and suffer from blurring of vision, difficulty driving at night and loss of stereopsis, or the ability to focus upon an object with both eyes and create a single stereoscopic image.
 Multifocal. Multifocal approaches are designed to provide both distance and near focus at the same time in each eye. Generally, both depth perception, or the ability to judge the distance of an object, and contrast sensitivity, or the ability to detect detail having subtle color gradations, are generally improved when two eyes can focus on an object. In addition, these approaches are intended to be improvements over constantly taking glasses off and putting them back on (possibly by wearing glasses around the neck) or by using bifocal or varifocal glasses or contact lenses, in which the eye is trained to look through the top part for distance vision and the bottom part for near vision. Multifocal effects can be achieved by lens replacement, including multifocal IOLs (IOLs with different zones of varying power), or through the creation of a multifocal cornea using laser refractive surgery (to create two or more refractive zones on the central cornea) or intrastromal ablation (laser used to make small changes in the thickness of the cornea). As with monovision, a significant drawback of these multifocal approaches is the complexity of achieving additional correction, if vision further deteriorates. In addition, some patients may experience halos, or rings around lights, at night, and it may also take time for multifocal patients to adapt to the different focal areas.
 Restoring Accommodation. Accommodating approaches generally attempt to replace the natural lens with an accommodating IOL, which is an artificial lens that is designed to mimic the movement of the natural crystalline lens of the eye. All IOL-based surgeries are susceptible to opacification, or clouding, of the lens capsule, which is the part of the natural lens covering that remains after surgery, decreasing vision and requiring a laser procedure to cut a hole in the clouded back lining of the lens capsule to allow light to pass through the membrane to the retina. Accommodating IOLs are also subject to certain other complications pertaining to the shrinkage, closure or clouding of the capsule that can reduce the mode of action of the accommodating IOLs, rendering them less effective. Other less common accommodating techniques include lens softening and scleral relaxation techniques, which are designed to improve near vision by restoring the function of the eye’s own accommodative system. Lens-softening techniques use pharmaceuticals or lasers to soften or change the structure of the natural crystalline lens, allowing it to flex better to increase accommodation. Scleral relaxation techniques use implants in the sclera of the eye to increase the eye’s ability to focus at near distances. To date, these procedures have had little documented success.
 Corneal Inlays. Corneal inlays include miniature surgically implanted lenses (such as our microlens), optical devices inserted into the cornea to reshape the front surface of the eye, and small implants to reduce the size of the opening into the eye to reset the angle of the light rays entering the eye and reduce both the number of rays and the light scatter, each of which is designed to improve near vision.
Our Solution 
 We have designed our microlens to address certain limitations of other surgical approaches to treat presbyopia. The critical aspects of our solution include:
  
• | Effective Treatment Option for Emmetropic Presbyopes. The largest sub-group of the presbyopic population is emmetropic presbyopes, or those individuals without significant refractive error who suffer from presbyopia. Emmetropic presbyopes account for approximately 38% of the total presbyopic population. We believe that ophthalmologists are generally reluctant to recommend a LASIK or IOL procedure as a solution for an emmetropic presbyope given the inherent risks and visual compromises of such procedures. Because our procedure does not involve the removal of the natural lens, the reshaping of the cornea or the removal of corneal tissue, we believe that ophthalmologists will be more likely to recommend our microlens as a solution for emmetropic presbyopes than a LASIK or IOL procedure.

• | Complementary Solution. While our solution is intended primarily for emmetropic-presbyopes, or those individuals who suffer from presbyopia but do not have any other visual disorder, it has also been used effectively on plano-presbyopes after laser procedures or lens replacement procedures for treatment of presbyopia.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimally Invasive. Our microlens is implanted in a pocket in the cornea created with a femtosecond laser. The pocket seals itself within a few days, holding the lens in place. The procedure does not require the reshaping of the cornea and no corneal tissue is removed. Moreover, the nature of our solution permits normal nutrient flow to the cornea, enabling corneal metabolism. As a result, there is less potential for dry-eye symptoms and less damage to the collagen fibers that support corneal shape and structure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Correction Options. The range of optical power corrections available in our microlens allows the ophthalmic surgeon to choose the correction most appropriate for the patient’s specific near vision requirements, as opposed to a unilateral “one size fits all” approach.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invisible. The clear nature of our microlens renders it invisible to the naked eye which we believe will make it appealing to patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Does Not Hinder Certain Other Procedures. Our microlens does not hinder examination of the retina and other structures in the eye necessary to diagnose other ocular health disorders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimal Side Effects. In the limited number of procedures performed to date outside of the United States and the limited number of procedures performed as part of our U.S. staged pivotal clinical trial, healing and adaptation to the microlens generally begin immediately after the surgery, with the immediate common side effects of such a procedure generally being mild eye dryness and irritation, transient elevated intraocular pressure due to standard post-surgery medication regimen, corneal haze (the activation of inflammatory cells in connection with surgery), transient light sensitivity (an abnormal occurrence of photosensitivity associated with the femtosecond laser) and certain visual symptoms, such as halos or glare.

 We believe that surgical treatment for presbyopia represents a large new market opportunity for ophthalmic surgeons. The market for traditional surgical ophthalmic treatments, such as LASIK for myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, and traditional monofocal IOLs for cataracts, is highly mature. Our procedure utilizes the femtosecond laser currently used for certain LASIK surgeries, cataract surgeries and cornea replacement surgeries. We believe that many ophthalmic clinics equipped with such lasers are not operating at full capacity, and we hope to utilize such untapped capacity. Our procedure would allow these ophthalmic clinics and ophthalmic surgeons to introduce a new treatment modality using their existing laser equipment, adding incremental revenue without the need for significant new capital commitments.
 We believe demand is likely to be fueled further by the ever-evolving, near-vision needs resulting from the increasing reliance on smart phones, tablets and other technological advances requiring good near vision.
 Our Technology
 Our microlens is a disc shaped lens that has a refractive zone in the periphery designed to improve near vision problems associated with presbyopia. The two figures below illustrate the design of our microlens.

6

Our microlens is 3.2 millimeters (mm) in diameter, has an edge thickness of 0.015 mm and has a center thickness that ranges from approximately 0.03 mm to 0.05 mm (depending on the lens power). Once implanted, it is invisible to the naked eye. Our microlens is made of a hydrophilic acrylic material, similar to the kind that has been used to make IOLs for over 20 years. Our microlens is designed to be removable. In addition, our microlens is designed to reduce the risk of permanent corneal tissue loss and is designed to be biocompatible with the cornea, allowing for corneal metabolism, which is essential to the health and normal functioning of the cornea.
 Ocular dominance is the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other. Our microlens is implanted in a patient’s non-dominant eye to minimize impact to binocular uncorrected distance vision. Through implantation in the patient’s non-dominant eye, our solution seeks to exploit the brain’s ability to perceptually suppress central vision in one eye when the two eyes are receiving disparate stimuli and focus on the clearer images while ignoring the blurrier images. Prior to implantation, we require patients to wear a contact lens for near vision correction in their non-dominant eye for a minimum of five to seven days before insertion of our microlens in order to assess whether or not the patient is able to adapt to the change in the visual system. Not all prospective patients are able to adapt to the change in the visual system. Based on feedback that we have received from surgeons to date, we believe that approximately 40% of prospective patients who underwent monofocal contact lens correction in their non-dominant eye were unable to adapt to the change in the visual system and approximately 25% of prospective patients who underwent multifocal contact lens correction in their non-dominant eye were unable to adapt to the change in the visual system.
 To improve near vision, as shown below, the refractive peripheral portion of our microlens is designed to help focus light from near objects (darker shaded light) onto the retina.
 Near Vision with Microlens

To improve maximum distance vision, the central refractive portion of our microlens is designed to permit light from distant objects to pass through the cornea and lens and focus on the retina (lighter shaded light shown below). The refractive peripheral portion of the lens causes some distant light rays to focus in front of the retina, instead of on it (darker shaded light shown below). However, when the brain receives dual visual stimulus from the corrected non-dominant eye, as well as the uncorrected dominant eye, it is able to correctly combine the information into an image for the patient.

Distance Vision with Microlens

Insertion of our Microlens
 Our microlens is surgically implanted in an outpatient setting. The procedure, requiring only topical anesthesia, typically takes a trained ophthalmic surgeon approximately 10 minutes. The procedure and equipment needed to create a corneal pocket to insert the microlens are similar to those currently used in LASIK procedures. In addition to our microlens inserter, we believe that the existing infrastructure in most ophthalmic clinics equipped with femtosecond lasers and existing surgical tools in ophthalmic surgery clinics is sufficient for our procedure.
 The ophthalmic surgeon starts the procedure by making a mark on the cornea at the center of the visual axes in order to determine the most appropriate location of the corneal pocket as well as the microlens placement and alignment once in place. Then, using a 150 kilohertz or greater frequency femtosecond laser, the ophthalmic surgeon creates a pocket, approximately four to 5.5 mm in diameter, in the cornea of the patient’s non-dominant eye. Using a microlens inserter, the ophthalmic surgeon then inserts our microlens into the corneal pocket. Finally, the ophthalmic surgeon centers and checks the position of the implanted microlens before completing the surgery. The corneal pocket automatically seals itself within a few days, holding the microlens in place at the center of the eye’s visual axis.
 We have designed our microlens and procedure to be removable in a minimally invasive manner in the event that a patient wishes to have a stronger prescription microlens implanted. This may occur if a patient’s presbyopia significantly progresses over time or in the event that a patient wishes to have the microlens removed for any other reason, including if the patient is uncomfortable with the results, if neural adaptation is not achieved, or if technological advances produce alternative solutions in the future. In the United States, our IDE does not permit replacement of a microlens in the event that a patient’s microlens is removed after implantation. Also, in the United States, our IDE requires any removal of the microlens to be reported as an adverse event.
 The procedure to remove our microlens may take place in an outpatient setting, using only topical anesthesia. The removal procedure consists of opening the corneal pocket entry point and, using a fluid to lubricate the pocket of the lens, sliding the lens from the corneal pocket. This procedure typically takes a trained ophthalmic surgeon approximately 10 minutes. A new microlens can be immediately inserted into a patient’s existing corneal pocket.
 Through March 2019, we have shipped approximately 2,340 of our microlenses to commercial partners outside of the United States, of which ophthalmic surgeons have implanted approximately 1,350.  
 Clinical Studies
 We have completed a multicenter clinical study outside the United States. In addition, several third parties have conducted limited studies of our microlens. These studies are summarized below.

Evaluation Conducted Outside of the United States
 In early 2012, we completed a 12-month multicenter, post-market evaluation in Italy and Greece of our microlens in presbyopic patients between the ages of 45 and 60 to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our microlens. We designed, and oversaw the implementation of, the protocol for this evaluation, which was conducted at our request by a surgeon at the Vardinoyannion Eye Institute at the University of Crete in Crete, Greece and by a surgeon at Prato Hospital in Prato, Italy. The 12-month data for the 70 patients who completed the study demonstrated successful patient outcomes and a low rate of post-operative adverse events. The average UCVA-near in the operated eye pre-surgery for those 70 patients was 20/110 and 99% of those patients started the study with UCVA-near in the operated eye of 20/50 or worse. Key effectiveness findings from this evaluation included the following:

• | the average UCVA-near in the operated eye for such patients post-surgery was 20/27, 99% of such patients completed the study with 20/40 or better UCVA-near in the operated eye and 70% of such patients completed the study with 20/25 or better UCVA-near in the operated eye (see Figure 1 below);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | although there was a slight loss in uncorrected distance visual acuity (the ability to see distant objects without prescription enhancement), or UCVA-distance, in the operated eye (see Figure 4 below), there was no significant change in binocular UCVA-distance (UCVA-distance when using both eyes) from before treatment to after treatment in this study (see Figure 2 below); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there was no significant change in best corrected distance visual acuity (distance vision using prescription enhancement), or BCVA-distance, in the operated eye after 12 months (see Figure 3 below).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A Snellen chart is an eye chart used by eye care professionals and others to measure visual acuity. It usually consists of letters printed in lines of decreasing size which a person is asked to read at a fixed distance. 20/20 is a term used to define normal visual acuity, which relates to the Snellen chart. The first number denotes a certain distance, and the second number denotes the distance at which a person with normal visual acuity could read clearly those letters that the subject of the assessment can read clearly at the distance denoted in the first number. The standard distance for testing distance visual acuity is 20 feet. Thus, with respect to distance vision, if an individual has 20/100 vision, it means that a person with normal distance vision can read at 100 feet what the patient can only read at 20 feet (poor distance vision). 20/10 vision, on the other hand, would mean the individual has better than normal distance vision, being able to read at 20 feet what a person with normal distance vision could only read at 10 feet. With respect to near vision, the 20/20 nomenclature is used with the distances in the first number and the second number scaled to the distance used in the study. Thus, an individual with 20/20 near vision means the patient can read clearly those letters at the distance tested (usually 40 centimeters (cm) in the United States and 33 cm outside of the United States) that a person with normal near visual acuity could read clearly at that distance. In our post-market evaluation, we tested visual acuity using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Chart, or ETDRS, Snellen chart; the distance used to test distance visual acuity was 20 feet and the distance used to test near visual acuity was 33 cm.

An important measurement is the number of patients who reach better visual acuity levels, or visual correction, after treatment. Before surgery, the 70 patients who completed the study had an average UCVA-near in the eye to be operated on of 20/110 and 99% of such patients started the study with UCVA-near measurements of 20/50 or worse in that eye. After treatment with our microlens, such patients had an average UCVA-near in the operated eye of 20/27 and 99% of such patients achieved UCVA-near measurements of 20/40 or better in the operated eye and 70% of such patients achieved UCVA-near measurements of 20/25 or better in the operated eye. The following chart summarizes the positive UCVA-near results in this post-market evaluation:
 Figure 1
 Uncorrected Near Visual Acuity Operated Eye (33 cm chart)
 (N=70 at Month 12)
 
Another important measurement is the number of patients who maintain binocular UCVA-distance levels post-treatment. There was no significant change in binocular UCVA-distance from before treatment to after treatment in this study. This stability in binocular vision is important because it indicates that patients in the study did not experience a significant compromise in binocular UCVA-distance as a result of the insertion of our microlens, meaning that their normal binocular far vision was not compromised. The following chart summarizes the binocular UCVA-distance findings in this post-market evaluation:
Figure 2
 Uncorrected Binocular Distance Visual Acuity
 (N=70 at Month 12)

In addition, patients in this study experienced no significant change in BCVA-distance in the operated eye at 12 months post-implantation, which indicates that there was no compromise in the operated eye’s optical system at 12 months. The following chart summarizes BCVA-distance findings with respect to the patient’s operated eye in this post-market evaluation:
Figure 3
 Best Corrected Distance Vision Acuity Operated Eye
 (N=70 at Month 12)

There was a slight loss of UCVA-distance in the operated eye in the study population. Before surgery, 83% of patients achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/16 to 20/25 and 17% achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/30 to 20/40. After treatment with our microlens, 17% of patients achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/16 to 20/25, 53% achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/30 to 20/40, and 30% achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/50 or worse. Although, as mentioned above, there was no significant change in binocular UCVA-distance from before treatment to after treatment in this study, far distance vision in the operated eye is also important, particularly as it relates to overall patient satisfaction. In the study population, 78% of patients who responded reported that they perceived their UCVA-distance in the operated eye as “excellent” to “good.” This generally correlates to the data at month 12, where 70% of patients achieved 20/40 vision or better in the operated eye. The remaining 30% of patients achieved UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/50 or worse, and consistent with such results, 20% of patients who responded reported that they perceived their UCVA-distance in the operated eye as “fair.” One patient who responded considered his outcome with respect to UCVA-distance in the operated eye as “poor.” The following chart summarizes UCVA-distance findings with respect to the patient’s operated eye in this post-market evaluation:

 Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity Operated Eye
 (N=70 at Month 12)
 
There are several possible explanations for the loss of distance visual acuity in the operated eye, including, but not limited to the following:
  
• | the time required for neural adaptation, or the time it takes the brain to adapt to the change in the visual system;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improper patient selection, or the selection of patients who are intolerant of monovision, impatient or not willing to wait for the neural adaptation time period; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improper lens power selection, meaning the patient is difficult to refract.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A subset of 39 patients enrolled in this evaluation underwent a monovision simulation, whereby pre-surgery UCVA-distance in the eye to be operated on with near vision contact lens correction in place was compared to UCVA-distance in the operated eye following implantation of our microlens. The purpose of this simulation was to evaluate whether UCVA-distance in the operated eye following implantation of our microlens is better than pre-surgery UCVA-distance in such eye with the use of a near vision correction contact lens. These patients were found to have an average UCVA-distance in the operated eye of 20/43 at 12 months post-surgery, while the same patients pre-surgery had an average UCVA-distance in the eye with near vision contact lens correction of 20/139. We believe that this result is due to the nature of the design of our microlens which is intended to maintain distance vision in the operated eye to the greatest extent possible. The central portion of our microlens is designed to allow for light from distant objects to enter the eye and focus on the retina, and the retina ultimately transmits that image to the brain. Figure 5 below illustrates the findings in this evaluation with respect to post-surgery UCVA-distance in the operated eye compared to pre-surgery UCVA-distance in the eye to be operated upon with near vision contact lens correction in place:

Figure 5
 
Overall, patient satisfaction with the procedure was generally high. 97% of patients who responded reported “excellent” or “good” perception of UCVA-near, and 97% of patients who responded reported “excellent” or “good” perception of binocular UCVA-distance. 75% of patients who responded reported no use of glasses for near tasks while the remaining 25% reported use of glasses less than 50% of the time. 78% of patients who responded indicated that they used glasses for near tasks more than 50% of the time prior to implantation.
 Key safety findings from the evaluation over a 12-month period included the following:
  
• | low rate of post-operative adverse events;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | one patient complained one week after implantation of significant halos and glare when driving at night and requested removal of the microlens (the lens was removed one month post-surgery);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one case of transient light sensitivity syndrome was reported: this represents an abnormal occurrence of photosensitivity associated with the femtosecond laser, which resolved after application of a topical steroid regimen;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one case of epithelial ingrowth was reported: this represents an abnormal growth of corneal epithelium in an area where it does not belong, associated with the femtosecond laser, which resolved after the ingrowth was surgically cleared; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | four cases of transient stromal haze were reported: these cases involved the activation of inflammatory cells in connection with surgery, which resolved after application of a topical steroid regimen.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There was no significant change in:
  
• | intraocular pressure, or the fluid pressure in the eye;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | endothelial cell density, or the tissue layer undersurface of the cornea and which regulates corneal water content;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pachymetry, or the measure of corneal thickness; or
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | binocular contrast sensitivity.
--+--------------------------------

 We continue to evaluate our microlens through clinical studies and marketing and post-marketing evaluations in connection with regulatory requirements and our commercialization efforts. In addition, through March 2019, we have shipped approximately 2,340 of our microlenses to commercial partners outside of the United States, of which ophthalmic surgeons have implanted approximately 1,350.

Third Party Studies
 Our microlens has been the subject of certain third party studies that have been conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of our microlens. We did not commission these studies or design, review or oversee the implementation of their protocols (although we paid the annual fees of the institutional review board, or “IRB”, reviewing one such study in Japan), and we have limited information with respect to these studies. These studies have reported certain adverse effects relating to the safety and effectiveness of our microlens. In connection with the findings in certain of such studies and observations of other surgeons regarding our procedure, we have undertaken certain investigative actions as part of our ongoing risk mitigation efforts. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If concerns regarding side effects from presbyopia-correcting surgery generally, or our products specifically, develop, including as a result of third-party studies and publications, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.”
U.S. Staged Pivotal Clinical Trial
 In May 2014, we began a staged pivotal clinical trial to seek marketing approval for our microlens in the United States. See “Clinical Development and Commercialization Targets” below for a description of this study. For a description of adverse events to date in this study, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If concerns regarding side effects from presbyopia-correcting surgery generally, or our products specifically, develop, including as a result of third-party studies and publications, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.”

On May 23, 2017, we reported the following data from our U.S. staged pivotal clinical trial. Through May 19, 2017, 421 subjects had undergone insertion of the Company’s microlens during the staged pivotal clinic trial that the Company is performing to obtain the clinical data required to enable the Company to obtain pre-market approval from the FDA. Data (representing 100% of the study cohort at month 18 and excluding subjects who had the Microlens explanted or those that did not return for scheduled trial visits and considered lost to follow-up) made available to the Company in May 2017 indicates that:
  
• | Subjects gained an average of 5 lines of uncorrected near visual acuity (the ability to see close objects without prescription enhancement) in treated eyes (Figure A).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 82% of subjects achieved 20/40 or better uncorrected distance vision in treated eyes (Figure B) and there was little to no change in binocular uncorrected distance vision from preoperative values (Figure C), and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 98% of subjects achieved 20/40 or better best corrected distance vision in the treated eyes (Figure D) and there was little to no change in binocular best corrected distance vision from preoperative values (Figure E). (Presbia Flexivue MicrolensTM is designed to take advantage of binocular vision. Most patients have the ability to fuse images in the brain from each eye to ensure the best image. This process is known as “neuroadaptation.”).

Notwithstanding these results, we cannot assure you when or whether the Company will obtain pre-market approval, or what expenditures the Company will incur whether or not we obtain such approval, given the many significant risks associated with seeking such an approval from the FDA. Furthermore, certain adverse events have been reported as part of the on-going staged pivotal clinical trial. For a discussion of previously reported adverse events, please see the risk factors, including the risk factor titled “If concerns regarding side effects from presbyopia correction surgery generally, or our products specifically, develop, including as a result of third-party studies and publications, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.”, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 The Company requires PMA approval in order to market its products in the United States.
 
We submitted our fourth PMA module, containing 24-month data on 385 subjects, in the second quarter of 2018. Safety and effectiveness data for subjects with 24-month data was submitted as part of the PMA. On October 5, 2018, we received notification from the FDA that 36-month data on all subjects enrolled in our staged pivotal clinical trial, including additional safety and efficacy related information, is required before the FDA can complete its review of our PMA application. On April 3, 2019, the FDA granted an additional extension of time to respond, as we will need additional time to complete the 36-month Clinical Study Report and provide additional safety and efficacy related information requested by the FDA in its October 5, 2018 letter. The extension will provide us an additional 180-day period to respond, and we anticipate (though no assurance can be given) that we will complete the submission of all the requested information before the 180-day extension date of September 30, 2019. It is possible that neither our microlens nor any products we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain a PMA. Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-approval or new clinical studies as a condition of approval.   Clinical Development and Commercialization Targets 
 In December 2013, we received approval from the FDA to commence a staged pivotal clinical trial of our microlens in the United States. This clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, unmasked, multicenter clinical investigation. Beginning in May 2014, we enrolled a total of 75 subjects at six investigational sites in the United States. Beginning in June 2014, each of these subjects underwent insertion of our microlens in the subject’s non-dominant eye. Based on six-month data on 52 of these subjects, in January 2015, we submitted to the FDA an interim safety report as a supplement to our IDE. In February 2015, we received approval from the FDA to commence second stage enrollment in this trial. Through February 15, 2018, 346 subjects have undergone insertion of our microlens in the second stage of this study. All subjects will be followed for three years following implantation. Subjects from outside the United States are not enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint is UCVA-near at 24 months post- implantation, together with safety objectives such as a low rate of ocular adverse events, endothelial cell loss over time in the operated eye, and an assessment of BCVA-distance and contrast sensitivity in the operated eye (the visual ability, with distance vision correction in place, to see objects that may not be outlined clearly or that do not stand out from their background). Although our microlens is designed to be removable, our IDE requires any removal to be reported as an adverse event. We pursued a modular PMA submission strategy whereby we submitted to the FDA our first module in the second quarter of 2016, containing information regarding biocompatibility. We submitted the second and third modules in the first quarter of 2017, containing information regarding preclinical testing, engineering and manufacturing. We submitted our fourth PMA module, containing 24-month data on 385 subjects, in the second quarter of 2018. Safety and effectiveness data for subjects with 24-month data was submitted as part of the PMA. On October 5, 2018, we received notification from the FDA that 36-month data on all subjects enrolled in our staged pivotal clinical trial, including additional safety and efficacy related information, is required before the FDA can complete its review of our PMA application. On April 3, 2019, the FDA granted an additional extension of time to respond, as we will need additional time to complete the 36-month Clinical Study Report and provide additional safety and efficacy related information requested by the FDA in its October 5, 2018 letter. The extension will provide us an additional 180-day period to respond, and we anticipate (though no assurance can be given) that we will complete the submission of all the requested information before the 180-day extension date of September 30, 2019. It is possible that neither our microlens nor any products we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain a PMA. Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-approval or new clinical studies as a condition of approval. 
 Outside of the United States, we plan to focus our commercialization and ongoing clinical trials in Germany and South Korea.
 Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading provider of corneal lens implants for patients with presbyopia, which includes obtaining regulatory approval of the Flexivue Microlens from the FDA and, through our European CE Mark, selective commercialization and ongoing clinical trials in Germany and South Korea. 
U.S. Staged Pivotal Clinical Trial
 Gaining approval to market our products in the United States is a critical element in our strategy. In order to obtain such approval, we must obtain a PMA from the FDA. We cannot assure you when or whether we will obtain such an approval, or what expenditures we will incur whether or not we obtain such approval, given the many significant risks associated with seeking such an approval from the FDA.

International Commercialization
 By affixing the Conformité Européene mark, or European Union CE Mark, to the products, we are authorized to market the Flexivue microlens throughout the EEA and, through mutual recognition agreements, in Switzerland (certain EEA countries also require additional in-country registration). 
 On December 10, 2017, our board of directors approved the re-ordering of the Company’s operational priorities, focusing its resources on FDA approval of its microlens and ongoing clinical trials and commercialization efforts in Germany and South Korea.  These actions reduce the pre-FDA approval marketing, manufacturing and engineering expenses associated with the post-FDA approval U.S. commercial launch of our microlens.  
 Sales & Marketing
 We intend to utilize a direct selling structure unless a country requires us to sell through a distributor, agent or we determine that a distributor/agent will offer us a more effective path to commercialization.  We have a focused team consisting of our European commercial vice president, our clinical services director, clinical application specialists and surgical trainers. Our microlens and the procedure to implant our microlens are not currently reimbursed through private or governmental third-party payors in any country, nor do we anticipate that our microlens and the procedure to implant our microlens will be reimbursable through private or governmental third-party payors in the foreseeable future. Although the commercialization of our microlens depends on a prospective patient’s ability to cover the costs of our microlens and the implantation procedure and we believe that a substantial portion of presbyopes worldwide do not have the financial means to cover the costs of our microlens, we believe that a direct patient-pay model enables medical providers to avoid pricing pressure from private or governmental third-party payors. We do not have control over the prices that medical providers charge patients for our microlens and the implantation procedure.
Research and Development 
 We remain focused on advancing our technology and continuing to improve our microlens. We maintain an active internal research and development process, which also includes clinical activities and regulatory affairs. We expended $3.5 million and $7.1 million for research and development during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technologies and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We strive to protect our investment in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our products through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as customary confidentiality and other contractual protections. We own intellectual property related to refractive powered inlays to treat presbyopia.  We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, specifically the patents therein, also gives us the ability to expand into broader vision correction solutions if we so decide. However, the extent to which our intellectual property will provide us with protection and enable us to commercialize our proprietary technology without interference from others is subject to numerous risks. See “Risk Factors—Risk Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
Patents 
 We currently own six issued U.S. patents, and four pending U.S. patent applications, all of which we consider material to our business. Three of our existing patents relate to our microlens inserter and corresponding methods of use; these patents expire in 2030 or 2031.  Two additional patents relate to the method and apparatus to package and transport our microlens, making it readily accessible; these patents expire in 2030. The other patent relates to a method that can be used by a laser to cut a pocket in the cornea and insert the microlens; this patent expires in 2028. Our four pending applications relate to a method and apparatus to package and transport our microlens, to an extension of the method for laser cutting a corneal pocket to insert our microlens, to the apparatus and method to use a preloaded inserter to insert our microlens, and a system for inserting our intracorneal lens.  
 Additionally, we have a total of 33 foreign patent applications, 27 of which are still pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. The foreign applications correspond to the content of the six issued U.S. patents. We currently own a patent in Canada, which corresponds to the U.S. patent which covers the method and apparatus to insert our microlens, and we have granted applications in Israel and China which correspond to the same U.S. patent. We also own patents in Japan and Australia, which correspond to the U.S. patent which covers the microlens inserter. 
 Our patents and patent applications may allow us to exclude others from practicing our proprietary inventions and may provide us with an opportunity to obtain royalties or cross-licenses of intellectual property from other manufacturers. Because we have limited knowledge of the research and development efforts and strategic plans of our competitors, we can only estimate the value of our patents and patent applications. Competitors may be able to design products and/or processes that avoid infringing our patent portfolio as it may exist from time to time. We may choose to abandon any of our issued or pending U.S. and/or foreign patents and/or patent applications that no longer match our commercialization and IP strategy.
 18

Trademarks
 Worldwide, we have several registered trademarks and pending trademark applications that we consider to be important to our business. The scope and duration of trademark protection varies widely throughout the world. In some countries, trademark protection continues only as long as the mark is used. Other countries require registration of trademarks and the payment of registration fees. Trademark registrations are generally for fixed but renewable terms. 
Confidentiality Agreements
 We protect our proprietary technology, in part, through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to Presbia, without additional consideration, inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by Presbia, subject to customary exceptions.
Competition 
 The medical device industry in general, and the ophthalmic medical device market in particular, are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants. Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition.
 We expect to compete against companies that are developing corneal inlay surgical solutions for presbyopia, such as the KAMRA lens owned by CorneaGen, Inc. (previously known as Sightlife Surgical Inc.), which acquired the product from AcuFocus, Inc. in March 2018. The KAMRA corneal inlay attempts to use small aperture optics to reduce distortion by eliminating peripheral light rays and limiting the width of diverging light rays. The KAMRA completed pivotal clinical trials in the U.S. and received FDA approval in April 2015. LensGen, Inc. is a newer company with little publicly available information regarding its intraocular lens which is being designed to harness fluidics and displacement to manipulate curvature to better capture light. ReVision Optics, Inc., which developed a corneal inlay solution and received FDA approval in June 2016, discontinued commercial activity in February 2018. Refocus Group, Inc. has developed the VisAbility Micro-Insert System, a procedure performed on both eyes and consisting of micro implants inserted just below the surface of the eye. Refocus Group, Inc. submitted its final module to the FDA for pre-market approval of the VisAbility Micro-Insert System in December 2017. The KAMRA corneal inlay, like the Presbia microlens, has marketing approval in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, including the EEA, and can be expected to compete with Presbia in such jurisdictions. However, we believe our microlens is less cosmetically conspicuous than the KAMRA and offers a wider range of optical power corrections.
 We expect to compete against companies that offer alternative surgical treatment methodologies, including monovision, multifocal and accommodating approaches, and companies that promote reading glasses and/or contact lenses as approaches for responding to presbyopia. At any time, our known competitors and other potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that may compete directly with our products. In addition, they may gain a market advantage by developing and patenting competitive products or processes earlier than we can or by obtaining regulatory approvals/clearances or market registrations more rapidly than we can.
 Certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, regulatory approval, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do. Because of the size of the presbyopia market and the high growth profile of that market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
  
• | improved outcomes for patients and other product quality issues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | product innovation;
--+--------------------


• | acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ease of use and reliability;
--+-----------------------------


• | regulatory status and speed to market;
--+---------------------------------------


• | product price and procedure price; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | reputation for technical leadership.
--+-------------------------------------

 We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors.

Manufacturing 
 Our microlens is manufactured using hydrophilic acrylic material that has been utilized in the lens manufacturing market for the last 20 years. This material is well known and has an established safety profile. High precision lathing machines are used to generate sub-micro level accuracy of convex/concave radii. Like other traditional IOL manufacturing processes, the manufacturing of the microlens is divided into a dry and a wet process.
 We currently have certified ISO Class 8 cleanroom manufacturing capacity in Irvine, California. Items manufactured in this facility to date have been used solely for the current IDE. We believe the facility is scalable to meet future U.S. and out of the U.S., or “OUS”, demand with the Irvine facility having received all applicable regulatory registrations, approvals and certifications in December 2016, allowing us to manufacture CE marked products at this site. Our U.S. facility received regulatory approval from the State of California to manufacture our microlens for our U.S. staged pivotal trial, and during 2014 and 2015, this facility provided all of the required lenses that were used in the treatment phase for our ongoing IDE. Additionally, our U.S. facility has demonstrated conformity with the Essential Requirements under Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC, referred herein as the EU Medical Device Directive, with respect to the manufacture of our microlens for sale in the EEA and FDA Quality System Regulation 21 CFR Part 820, current good manufacturing practices (“CGMPs”).
 We believe that our current manufacturing arrangements are sufficient to support our foreseeable manufacturing needs. Product manufactured at the Irvine, California site includes lens manufacturing, final assembly, and packaging.  Sterilization for the Irvine manufactured product is conducted at an FDA registered and ISO 13485 certified full service medical device contract manufacturer. We successfully completed the ISO 13485:2016 audit with no major findings, which was an essential step in recertifying under the ISO standard with annual surveillance audits for the next two years. The renewal of the company’s CE Mark has been completed and is valid through 2022. Inventory of our microlens is housed at our facilities in Ireland as well as in Irvine, CA.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 We use a wide range of raw materials in the production of our products, with most of the raw materials and components being purchased from external suppliers. The hydrophilic acrylic material used to manufacture our microlens is supplied to us by a single supplier located in the United Kingdom. We would be required to obtain approval from the FDA in the event that we wished to use different material or similar material from a different supplier with respect to any products to be offered and sold in the United States. Although we do not have a guaranteed supply commitment from our sole supplier of such hydrophilic acrylic material, we believe that such supplier will be able to sufficiently meet our currently anticipated supply needs. Additionally, we do not currently have any long-term agreements in place for the supply of any other raw materials used in manufacturing of the microlens, however, all other materials are currently readily available from a number of suppliers, both in the United States and abroad.
Government Regulation
 Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. governmental authorities, such as the competent authorities of the countries of the EEA. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:

• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials;
--+-----------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | regulatory clearances and approvals, including premarket clearance and approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conformity assessment procedures;
--+----------------------------------


• | product traceability and record keeping procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | product complaints, complaint reporting, recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market studies; and
--+-------------------------


• | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

 20

To market and sell our products in any country, we must first seek and obtain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations and comply with the laws and regulations of that country. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, certifications or registrations and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals, certifications and/or registrations are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals, certifications and/or registrations in any country for which we have yet to receive such approvals, certifications and/or registrations or that we will be able to maintain any regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations that we currently possess in any country. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products or if we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory laws, rules and regulations, our ability to sell our products could be jeopardized and we could be subject to enforcement actions. See “Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Requirements” for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that apply to Presbia in connection with government regulation of our products.
 Regulatory Requirements in the United States
 Under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with extensive regulation relating to the issues described above, including regulations governing the design, testing, manufacturing, packaging, quality, servicing and marketing of medical products. Our immediate focus is upon the steps that we must take before our products can be marketed and sold in the United States.
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that is distributed commercially in the United States requires either prior 510(k) clearance or prior approval of a PMA application from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose low to moderate risk are placed in either Class I or II, which, absent an exemption, requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. Our Class III products/devices require prior approval of a PMA application from the FDA. Both premarket clearance and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing.
Premarket Approval
 A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA if, as is the case with the microlens, the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s regulations. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trials, data and labeling to support the FDA’s determination that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. After a PMA application is complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application takes between one and three years, and may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information and/or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement actions, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, as well as for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 Our microlens, as an implanted device, cannot be marketed and sold in the United States without PMA approval. We anticipate that other products that we may develop in the future, as well as modifications to our existing products, will also be associated with the implantation process and thus in all likelihood will be subject to PMA approval rather than 510(k) clearance.
 21

IDE Applications
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support product clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
 In December 2013, we received approval of our IDE from the FDA to begin a staged pivotal clinical trial of our microlens in the United States.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials for a Class III device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the responsible IRBs at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. During a study, sponsors are required to comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record-keeping and with prohibitions on promoting investigational devices or making safety or effectiveness claims for them. Sponsors are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices.
 We began enrollment for our U.S. staged pivotal clinical trial in May 2014 and began treating patients in June 2014. Initially, 75 subjects underwent insertion of our microlens at six investigational sites in the first stage of this study. Based on six-month data on 52 of these subjects, in January 2015, we submitted an interim safety report to the FDA along with a supplement to our IDE requesting approval to begin second stage enrollment. In February 2015, we received approval from the FDA to commence second stage enrollment in this trial. We were authorized to enroll up to an additional 337 subjects at up to nine additional investigational sites. It is possible that neither our microlens nor any products we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain a PMA.  Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-approval or new clinical studies as a condition of approval.
 Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with U.S. federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare privacy. The investigators must obtain patient informed consents, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record-keeping requirements.
 In addition, the FDA’s grant of permission to proceed with clinical testing does not constitute a binding commitment that the FDA will consider our study design adequate to support PMA approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that the data that we generate during a clinical study will meet chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing approval.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
  
• | establishment registration and device listings with the FDA, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSRs, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling control and advertising regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, or off-label, uses or indications, and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval or clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22

 
• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We will be required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing facilities will be subject to FDA inspections for compliance with QSRs. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will also be required to comply with FDA requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. FDA regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications. The FDA may conduct unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions and related consequences including, but not limited to:
  
• | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for premarket approval or clearances of new products or modified products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | once we have received premarket approvals or clearances, withdrawing those approvals or clearances that are already granted;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution; and
--+--------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Requirements Outside of the United States
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to non-U.S. regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA market approval. These differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of our products.
 In order to be placed on the market within the EEA, medical devices must meet the essential requirements set out in the relevant medical device legislation. The principal legislation regulating general medical devices in the EEA is Directive 93/42/EEC, referred to herein as the EU Medical Devices Directive. Where a medical device meets the essential requirements set out in the EU Medical Devices Directive and complies with the appropriate conformity assessment procedure, based on the classification of the medical device, a declaration or certificate of conformity will issue and a CE Mark may then be affixed to the product. Once a CE Mark has been affixed to the medical device, it may then be placed on the market in any country within the EEA and, through mutual recognition agreements, in Switzerland (subject to certain localized registration and language requirements).
 23

In February 2010, we received a CE certificate of conformity from our notified body (a private organization designated by the competent authorities of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments and verify the conformity of manufacturers and their medical devices with Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Directive) for our microlens allowing the CE mark to be affixed to our microlens, permitting our microlens to be placed on the market within any state in the EEA and, through mutual recognition agreements, Switzerland (subject to certain localized registration and language requirements). In May 2013, we issued a declaration of conformity for our microlens inserter allowing the CE Mark to be affixed to our microlens inserter. We have also obtained an ISO 13485 quality system certification, which confirms that our medical device manufacturing quality management system is compliant with globally recognized standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization. We are required to keep up-to-date and remain compliant with the most recently issued standards. In order to maintain our certificate of conformity and CE Mark, we must continue to comply with the EU Medical Devices Directive and pass annual facilities audit inspections by an inspection agency of the EEA to ISO 13485 standards. In addition, a notified body or other competent authority in an EEA country may perform post-marketing audits on our products and premises from time to time. Failure to comply with such requests in a timely manner, and any adverse findings in any such audit, could result in the withdrawal of our certificate of conformity and our CE Mark, and the recall or withdrawal of our products from the EEA market. Each certificate of conformity may be valid for a maximum of five years but would typically be valid for three years. Our existing certificate of conformity for our microlens is valid until March 2022, and our CE Mark is valid through December 2022. At the end of each period of validity, we are required to apply to the notified body for a renewal of our certificate of conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of our certificate of conformity and the notified body may require modifications to our products or to the related technical files before it agrees to issue a new certificate of conformity.
 On May 5, 2017, the European Commission officially published the Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) and came into force on May 25, 2017. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have a transition time of three years until May 26th 2020 to meet the requirements of the MDR. For some manufacturers, the new MDR provides an additional time after the date of application allowing them to place new products for a maximum of 4 more years on the market. Additional requirements will apply for this extended transition period.
 
In addition, we have obtained marketing authorization for our microlens and microlens inserter in certain countries outside of the EEA, including certain countries in which our microlens is currently commercially available. We are subject to the regulatory laws and regulations of each such country in order to maintain our marketing authorization. In addition, we will be subject to the regulatory laws and regulations of any additional country in which we obtain marketing approval to maintain such approval. These regulatory laws are complex and vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in a variety of enforcement actions, all of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Corruption Laws
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our ongoing non-U.S. operations and our expansion into additional countries outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
 24

Environmental Matters
 Our activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. environmental and pollution control laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we conduct business or have operations. We do not expect compliance with these laws to affect materially our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have no plans to invest in material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of our current fiscal year or for the next fiscal year. We are not aware of any pending actions, litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. However, environmental problems relating to our properties could develop in the future, and such problems could require significant expenditures. In addition, we cannot predict changes in environmental legislation or regulations that may be adopted or enacted in the future and that may adversely affect us.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 20 employees, six of whom hold advanced degrees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Facilities
 Our operations are currently conducted at two leased facilities. We lease one location with an aggregate of approximately 9,000 square feet of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in Irvine, California. We lease 610 square feet of office and warehouse space in Dublin, Ireland. Our corporate headquarters is currently located at our Dublin location.
 We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs. When our leases expire, we may seek to renew our leases or look for additional or alternate space for our operations. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
 Corporate History and Information
 In February 2015, Presbia PLC consummated its initial public offering of ordinary shares. Prior to our initial public offering, we effected a series of reorganization transactions described below.
 Presbia Holdings was organized in the Cayman Islands in 2007 as an exempted company with limited liability. In 2009, Presbia Holdings acquired Visitome, Inc., a California corporation and the developer of our corneal inlay technology.
 In October 2013, we completed a restructuring which involved the establishment of our interim holding company, Presbia Ireland, Limited, that directly or indirectly owns 100% of our business, assets and subsidiaries. Presbia Ireland, Limited is organized under the laws of Ireland as a private limited company. At the time of the restructuring, Presbia Ireland, Limited was wholly-owned by Presbia Holdings and certain intercompany debt was owed to Presbia Holdings by certain of its other subsidiaries. As part of the restructuring, approximately $12.2 million of such outstanding intercompany debt owed to Presbia Holdings was converted to equity of such subsidiaries. We refer to this transaction as the 2013 Restructuring.
 In November 2014, Presbia Holdings converted additional indebtedness owed to Presbia Holdings by certain subsidiaries of Presbia Ireland, Limited at that time to equity. In this transaction, approximately $23.5 million of outstanding intercompany debt owed to Presbia Holdings was converted to equity of such subsidiaries. We refer to this transaction as the 2014 Debt Conversion.
 In January 2015, Presbia Holdings converted all the remaining indebtedness owed by a subsidiary of Presbia Ireland, Limited at that time to equity. In this transaction, approximately $1.6 million of outstanding intercompany debt owed to Presbia Holdings was converted to equity of such subsidiary. We refer to this transaction as the 2015 Debt Conversion. In addition, immediately following the 2015 Debt Conversion, Presbia Holdings contributed all the share capital in issue in Presbia Ireland, Limited to Presbia PLC, an Irish incorporated public limited company formed in February 2014 for the purpose of consummating our initial public offering, in exchange for 9,166,667 ordinary shares of Presbia PLC. We refer to this transaction as the 2015 Capital Contribution. Presbia PLC previously issued 40,000 ordinary shares to Presbia Holdings upon its formation, in order to satisfy statutory requirements for the incorporation of all Irish public limited companies, which were re-designated as deferred shares under our memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of our initial public offering. We refer to the 2014 Debt Conversion, the 2015 Debt Conversion and the 2015 Capital Contribution, collectively, as the 2014-2015 Restructuring.
 25

We refer to the 2013 Restructuring, the formation and initial capitalization of Presbia PLC, and the 2014-2015 Restructuring, collectively, as the Reorganization Transactions.
 In August 2015, Presbia Holdings distributed the 9,166,667 ordinary shares of Presbia PLC, referred to herein as the 2015 Capital Contribution and an additional 500,000 ordinary shares acquired from the initial public offering for an aggregate of 9,666,667 ordinary shares, to its ordinary shareholders. Presbia Holdings was liquidated in November 2015.
 In December 2018, pursuant to a Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement, we effectuated a corporate restructuring involving certain of our subsidiaries, pursuant to which Presbia USA (which was previously an indirect subsidiary of Presbia PLC and a direct subsidiary of Presbia Ireland, Limited) became a direct subsidiary of Presbia PLC, and Presbia Ireland, Limited (which was previously a direct subsidiary of Presbia PLC) became an indirect subsidiary of Presbia PLC and a direct subsidiary of Presbia USA.
 The Companies effectuated a restructuring on December 10, 2018, which resulted in the inversion of the parent-subsidiary hierarchy of Presbia Limited and Presbia USA (the "Restructuring"), such that, following consummation of the Restructuring transaction (i) Presbia PLC became the direct parent of Presbia USA (with Presbia USA being a direct subsidiary of Presbia PLC), and (ii) Presbia USA became the direct parent of Presbia Ireland (with Presbia Ireland being a direct subsidiary of Presbia USA). Presbia USA issued to Presbia PLC two thousand (2,000) newly-issued shares of the common stock, par value US$0.01 per share, of Presbia USA and Presbia USA repurchased from Presbia Ireland the Old Presbia USA Shares for a purchase price of US$20 cash in hand, whereupon such Old Presbia USA Shares were returned to treasury.
 Visitome, Inc. one of our former subsidiaries, was liquidated in February 2019. Presbia Investments and Presbia Cooperatief U.A. are currently under liquidation proceedings in an effort to simplify the Company’s organizational structure.
 Our corporate structure as of April 12, 2019 is set forth below.

Our principal executive offices are located at Suite 7, Sandyford Office Centre, 17 Corrig Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, D18 N6K8, Ireland, and our telephone number is +353 (1) 551 1487.
