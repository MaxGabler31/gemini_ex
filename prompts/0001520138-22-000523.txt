Item 1. Business
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Company Overview
 We were incorporated on July 22, 2021. Plasma Innovative Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an emerging cold plasma application company. We intend to use our proprietary, cold plasma technology to treat crops and plant seeds for agriculture. We believe that treated seeds yield healthier and more productive plants and crops. One of our directors has spent the last 16 years testing and developing this technology, which has been assigned to the Company.
 
Since our inception, we have undertaken the following operations:
 

➢ | On August 6, 2021, we entered into the Technology Assignment Agreement (described below) with Mr. Hanliang Shao, our director, pursuant to which we acquired certain cold plasma technology used in our business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
➢ | On or about August 19, 2021, we competed the private placement of 1,300,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for a total offering of $130,000. 
➢ | We have made preliminary contact with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, who in turn have introduced us to the director of a large university in Pennsylvania. We are hopeful that we may be able to collaborate with this and other universities so as to reach local farmers, nurseries, greenhouses and seed companies.
➢ | In early 2022, we began collaborating with a Chinese plasma company to apply our technology for the reduction of chemicals and pesticides on herbs and teas grown in China (See “Recent Events” below). 

 
As of the date of this filing, we have begun the assembly and construction of our initial cold plasma processing unit which we will use for test purposes. We expect the unit to be completed by the end of first calendar quarter 2023.
 
Technology Assignment Agreement 
 As mentioned above, on August 6, 2021, we entered into the Technology Assignment Agreement with Mr. Shao, our former director. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Shao conveyed to us all of rights, titles and interests in and to three separate technologies. In exchange, Mr. Shao will earn 4,000,000 shares of our common stock upon the filing of a patent for the three technologies with the US Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) which relate to our plasma process. In addition, Mr. Shao shall be entitled to receive a total of 2,000,000 additional shares of our common stock issuable monthly over a three (3) year period beginning with the month of August 2021 (“Term”) at the rate of 55,556 shares per month, except in final month, the amount shall be 55,540, provided that during the Term, he does not breach the confidentiality and non-compete covenants contained in the agreement. Mr. Shao was entitled 111,112 shares of common stock at $0.001 par value under the agreement for the months of September 2021 and October 2021, which were issued in January 2022 at a value of $111. Mr. Shao passed away on November 20, 2021. On December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Continuation of Technology Assignment Agreement with Ping Wu, Tian Yang, Jun Shao, Yu Shao, Chunni Shao, and Dongni Shao (collectively, the “Shao Heirs”). Pursuant to this agreement, Mr. Tian Yang was appointed by the Shao Heirs to be the recipient and record holder of the shares of common stock issuable under the Technology Assignment Agreement. As our one of key researchers and founders passed away, Our business execution met big impact and we intend to file patents with the USPTO for the technologies by the end of the second calendar quarter of 2023.

Description of Plasma in General and Cold Plasma 
 Plasma is called the fourth state of matter after gas, solid and liquid. It was identified by Sir William Crooks in 1879. Plasma is roughly defined as a collection of equal positive and negative charge carriers and has zero total charge. It is actually a partially ionized gas, which may be a gaseous complex composed of electrons, ions of any polarity, gaseous atoms and molecules in any high-energy. It is estimated that outside of our planetary system, 99% of the universe is in a plasma state, that is, the earth is also surrounded by a layer of natural plasma called the ionosphere. Lightning, comet tails, and northern lights are also natural plasmas.
 
Plasma and is generally distinguished by temperature, meaning hot plasma in contrast with cold plasma. The temperature of hot plasma ranges from several thousand degrees to one hundred thousand degrees, while the temperature of cold plasma is room temperature.
 
Hot plasma typically is generated by an arc discharge at a pressure equal to or higher than the atmospheric pressure. Highly widespread in nature (in the form of comets, galaxies, flashes, lightning), they are characterized by a high frequency of collision between electrons and gas molecules and a high gas temperature of many thousands of degrees.
 
Low-pressure cold plasma technology also is referred to as vacuum plasma technology. This technology has its origin in the processing of semiconductor materials and printed circuit boards. Cold plasma also has been used recently to inactivate contaminating microbes on meats, poultry, fruits, and vegetables.
 
Description of Our Technology
 Mr. Shao, our former director, spent a number of years developing the application of cold plasma for the agriculture industry. In 2015, through his own internal testing, he discovered that cold plasma can interact with living organisms (biomolecules), thereby enabling living organisms (biomolecules) to obtain energy. Our process applies radio-frequency lighting supplied by the plasma source in a low-pressure vacuum environment to affect the seeds at the molecular level. The process occurs in a bacteria free environment with no emissions of any kind. Mr. Shao’s internal tests have indicated that radio-frequency lighting creates a photochemical reaction of seeds on the molecular level, similar to the impact of sunlight on a seed or plant. In sum, the plasma energy is transported and stored into the cells of the seeds. The stored energy increases the metabolic activity in the seed. The result of the metabolic activity is the permeability of the seed surface increases which allows for a greater uptake and retention of water and nutrients. Our process does not involve genetic modification of seeds. As the plant life cycle develops from seed to yield bearing plants, our internal tests have indicated that the plants are healthier, demonstrating superior qualities over conventional, untreated seeds.
 
These qualities include;
 

● | Increased crop yields. Our internal tests have indicated plant yield increases of between 6-8% on average and crop dependent. Increased plant yields result in greater profit for growers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced fertilizer use. Our seeds become charged with energy, as a result, we will recommend a reduction of fertilizer of approximately 20% because of the seed treated to become more viable per our internal tests. This advantage has an ecological and cost benefit. Reduced fertilizer has a favorable impact on the environment causing less fertilizer runoff in rivers, streams and lakes with a concomitant cost saving to the grower.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced need for pesticides. Because our process delivers a healthier plant which in turn is more disease resistant, we will recommend a reduction of 20% in pesticides per our internal tests. Similar to fertilizer use, reduced chemical inputs yield an ecological and cost benefit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Greater ability to withstand stresses. Again, a healthier plant is better able to withstand stress from drought, frost and heat. This means that crop damage can be minimized during unseasonal weather conditions resulting in a cost benefit to the grower.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved germination rate. Our germination rates range from 90% to 98% crop dependent compared to normal germination rates of 85%-90% crop dependent per our internal tests. This means that fewer seeds die in the planting and grow process. This benefit in turn produces higher annual yields separate from the plant yield increase discussed above.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although the favorable characteristics of our plasma process described above have been supported by our own internal testing, the results have not been corroborated by third party, independent tests.
 
Initial and Future Processing Plants.
 We have begun assembly of our initial processing plant. The initial plant will be a test plant and thus smaller than a fully operational plant. The test plant will be assembled at our facilities located at our facility in 523 School House Rd., Kennett Square, PA 19348. For our test unit, we will purchase off the shelf components provided by a number of suppliers, including a plasma power supply and vacuum pump. We have designed other components which will be fabricated by third parties and assembled at our facility. We intend to purchase or design similar but larger components for our fully operational plants which we likewise will assemble at our facility.
 
The below picture depicts a replica of a full production unit.

The process is as follows:
 

- | Seeds are poured into the vertical, intake cannister (top right in picture #1), which drop into a conveyer belt housed in the horizontal cannister (see conveyer belt depicted in picture #2 below), 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(picture #2)
 

- | The equipment is locked and the vacuum pump is engaged to replace the air in the chamber; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The plasma power supply is engaged at pre-determined parameters and the seeds enter the plasma chamber on the conveyor belt, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | After a brief period of plasma contact (10-20 seconds), the seed drop into the vertical, output cannister (bottom left in picture #1), the plasma power is turned off and the treatment ends. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The entire process occurs within 6-8 minutes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
The process described above will treat roughly 44 pounds of seeds per application using a full production unit.

Our Growth Strategy 
 We intend to initially market our technologies to farmers, nurseries, greenhouses and seed companies in close proximity to our facilities in Pennsylvania. We will invite potential users to our facility to conduct a test runs on various crops and plants. In order to facilitate that process, we will contact agriculture departments at major universities with the hopes of establishing collaborative testing of our technology. We believe favorable arrangements with these agriculture departments will lead to introductions to major farmers, nurseries and greenhouses in the area or state.
 
During the testing period, we expect to process a small quantity of seeds of various crops and plants per user and then have the user plant and cultivate the seeds in a comparative setting against their conventional or control methods. We expect the grow cycle to occur at the user’s location. We will require all test participants to provide us with a range of data points during certain times during the grow cycle. These data points will include germination rates, height, diameter, color, weight and yields of plants.
 
We believe a test period to run between 3 to 6 months which represents the growth cycle through harvest of various crops and plants. Following the harvests, we will analyze the data independently and with the test participant. Once the test period concludes, we are hopeful to enter into a processing arrangement with test participants whereby we process their seeds at an agreed fee based on the number of seed pounds processed. However, at this time, we do not have any fee arrangements and can not predict the fee that we be able to charge to our customers.
 
In addition to developing direct relationships with local farmers, nurseries, greenhouses and seed companies discussed above, in the first half of 2023 after the test equipment is constructed, we intend to:
 

■ | Collaborate with agriculture departments at various universities. We intend to contact various universities in the Northeast so as to use and test our technology in a controlled environment (ie against conventional measures). Many farmers and growers rely on university agriculture departments to assess new technologies. In addition, university agriculture departments provide entry to local farmer cooperatives. Cooperatives generally consist of the larger growers in the area that pool their buying and selling resources. We believe that favorable test results from university agriculture departments will cause us to penetrate the local market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Expand to other geographical regions in the US. We will attempt to replicate these efforts in other agricultural regions in the United States, with a particular emphasis on those regions that have longer growing seasons found in southern states, particularly Florida and western states, particularly, California and Arizona.

Arrangement with Pietro Industries Inc. 
 On August 8, 2021, the Company signed Joint and Evaluation Agreement with Pietro Industries Inc. for the purpose of jointly testing, evaluating and optimizing various technologies and process to verify the feasibility of mushroom stump processing at a commercial scale. The parties also signed an agreement allowing the Company to use the premises at 523 School House Rd., Kennett Square, PA 19348 in connection with the Joint and Evaluation Agreement. On September 18, 2021 but effective August 28, 2021, the Company and Pietro signed a termination agreement which ended the Office Space Using Agreement and Joint Testing and Evaluation Agreement. On that same date, Pietro agreed to allow the Company to use 1,000 square feet at its premises month to month on a rent free basis.
Recent Events.
 In January 2022, the Company began collaborating with a Chinese plasma company to determine the effectiveness of the Company’s cold plasma technology in reducing common chemicals and pesticides used in growing herbs in China. In March 2022, the Company conducted tests using its technology on several Chinese herbs supplied by the Chinese company (“Initial Test”) and the processed herbs were then shipped back to the Chinese company. The Chinese company tested the processed herbs and informed the Company the processed herbs had a substantial reduction in the chemicals and pesticides.

Following the Initial Test, in August and September 2022, the Chinese company sent an additional 10 herbs for processing. The Company expects to complete the processing during November 2022. It has required that the Chinese company a complete chemical analysis of the herbs pre and post treatment. In addition, in October 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the Chinese plasma company to further explore the use of the technology for Chinese herbs and teas. Under the agreement, the parties will attempt to mutually agree on the testing protocols and the equipment design for a new plasma plant. If the parties reach an agreement on such plans, the Chinese company will pay the company the sum of $10,000 as an upfront fee. In addition, the Chinese company will pay for all costs associated with the design, assembly and production of the new plasma plant. Once the plant is operational, the Company will be entitled to receive 20% of all service fees received by the Chinese company for the treatment of herbs using the technology.
 
Competition and Our Competitive Strengths.
 While the Company believes that there is no similar commercialized application of cold plasma for plant and crop seeds, it believes that it nonetheless will face competition in the agriculture market from other products, such as biologic products. Agricultural biologicals are a diverse group of products derived from naturally occurring microorganisms, plant extracts, beneficial insects or other organic matter. They are seed treatment systems that are derived from natural materials like plant extracts to improve the crop yield and ensures nutrient growth of the plant. They also are the substitutes of harmful chemicals that damage the environment. Agricultural biologicals are not only eco- friendly but also helps the farmers to grow healthier and nutritious food. Agricultural biologicals are used to replace the chemicals in farming to prevent the crops from diseases, weeds etc. to maintain crop health. Multiple companies are working for the development of highly performing agricultural products such as pesticides and fertilizers.
 
They are typically broken down into two or three major categories according to their use in agriculture:
 

● | Biostimulants (plant growth/productivity enhancement products), 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biopesticides (plant protection or biocontrol products), and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biofertility (plant nutrition products). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However these products are generally one use specific, meaning these products can treat one specific type of disease. In addition, they are significantly more expensive than conventional fertilizer and pesticides.
 
Key players operating in global agricultural biologicals market include BASF SE(Germany), Vegalab S.A.(US), Isagro S.P.A.(Italy), Evogene Ltd(Israel), Syngenta Crop Protection AG(Switzerland), Marrone Bio Innovations(US), UPL(India), Bayer AG(Germany), Valent Biosciences, Lallemand Inc., Koppert Biological Systems, Valagro S.P.A., Novozymes, CBF China Biofertilizers AG, Biolchim SPA, Symborg, Bienvenido, Andermatt Biocontrol AG, Verdesian Life Sciences., SEIPASA, Biobest Group NV, The DOW Chemical Company, Arysta Lifescience Limited, Certis USA LLC.
 
Regulatory Matters
 As mentioned hereinabove, the unit operates under low vacuum, so any emissions are internally contained. Because the process involves no chemical reactions and no emissions, there are no requirement for federal/state/local approvals for our process or products, including any environmental approvals. Because low energy plasmas do require high voltage power supplies, we will conform to standard local safety measures and regulations.
 
We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to conduct our business, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.

Employees
 As of the date of this Prospectus, we have no full time employees. Our officers and directors each will spend between 15 to 40 hours per week on the affairs of the Company, depending on the circumstances. However, each officer and director will have other business interest and thus, certain conflicts may arise from time to time regarding their allocation of time between the business of the Company and such other business interests. Currently, we have not entered into an employment agreement with any of our officers. The Company presently does not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, the Company may adopt plans in the future. During the next 3 to 12 months, we intend to hire an intern familiar with cold plasma to assist with our applications and a bookkeeper for our operations. Apart from that hire, management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time.
Properties
 Our corporate offices are located at 523 School House Road, Kennett Square, PA 19348. The lease began on August 1, 2021, is month to month and is rent free. The principal of the lessor is a business associate of Mr. Yang.
Our Intellectual Property.
 We intend to file for patent protection in the United States on certain aspects of our technology involving the rationality of the working gas inlet and making the glow discharge more uniform. At the present time, we have not prepared the patent application. Any application filed will be for a utility invention patent. The term for a utility patent in the United States is 20 years. We have not made a determination whether we will file for patent protection in any foreign jurisdictions. We can not guarantee that we will receive a patent in the United States or elsewhere from any patent application.
 
Presently, however, we do not have any patents protecting our technology. Instead, we rely on trade secrets and know-how using the process developed by our director, Mr. Shao. There is no assurance that others will not independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain unauthorized access to our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all future employees that work on our premises to enter into strict confidentiality agreements. Presently, however, we have no paid employees. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented technology in the event of an unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. While we have attempted to protect the unpatented proprietary technology that we develop or acquire, and will continue to attempt to protect future proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secrets, we believe that our success will depend, to a large extent, upon continued innovation and technological expertise.
 
In general, the level of protection afforded by a patent is directly proportional to the ability of the patent owner to protect and enforce those rights through legal action. Since our financial resources are limited, and patent litigation can be both expensive and time consuming, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prosecute an infringement claim in the event that a competitor develops a technology or introduces a product that infringes on one or more of our patents or patent applications. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop other technologies that render our proposed products obsolete. In general, we believe the best protection of our proprietary technology will come from market position, technical innovation, speed-to-market, and product performance. There is no assurance that we will realize any benefit from our intellectual property rights.
 
Product Liability.
 Due to nature of the Company’s business, the Company may face claims for product liability resulting from the failure of its cold plasma technology. Presently, the Company does not maintain any product liability insurance to cover any claims for any process failures.
