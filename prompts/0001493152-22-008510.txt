Business Overview

We are an early-development-stage biosciences company developing next-generation mental health and oncology treatments using our clinical discovery platform to help leverage psychedelic-derived molecules for the mind and synthetic cannabinoids for the body. We seek to improve the lives of patients suffering from cancer, initially by developing palliative and supportive care products for people suffering from certain side effects of cancer and cancer treatment such as anxiety, depression, pain, and skin damage from radiation treatment. We currently intend to offer such palliative and supportive care products in the United States, following approval through established regulatory pathways.
Amalgamation Agreement with MagicMed Industries Inc. 
 
On May 24, 2021, the Company entered into the Amalgamation Agreement with HoldCo, Purchaser, and MagicMed, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company, indirectly through Purchaser, acquired all of the outstanding securities of MagicMed in exchange for securities of the Company by way of an amalgamation under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Amalgamation Agreement, such that, upon completion of the Amalgamation (as defined herein), Amalco will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Amalgamation was completed on September 16, 2021.


At the effective time of the Amalgamation (the “Effective Time”), holders of outstanding common shares of MagicMed (the “MagicMed Shares”) received such number of shares of common stock of the Company (“Company Shares”) representing, together with the Company Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the Converted Options (each as defined herein), approximately 36.6% of the issued and outstanding Company Shares (on a fully diluted basis). The MagicMed Shares were initially converted into Amalco Redeemable Preferred Shares (as defined in the Amalgamation Agreement), which immediately following the Amalgamation were redeemed for 0.000001 of a Company Share. Following such redemption, the shareholders of MagicMed received additional Company Shares equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Amalgamation Agreement) multiplied by the number of MagicMed Shares held by each such shareholder. Additionally, following the Effective Time (i) each outstanding MagicMed stock option was converted into and became an option to purchase (the “Converted Options”) the number of Company Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of MagicMed Shares subject to such MagicMed stock option, and (ii) each holder of an outstanding MagicMed warrant (including Company Broker Warrants (as defined in the Amalgamation Agreement), the “Warrants”) received upon exercise of such Warrant that number of Company Shares which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Amalgamation if, immediately prior to the date of the Amalgamation (the “Effective Date”), such holder had been the registered holder of the number of MagicMed Shares to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had exercised such holder’s Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time (the foregoing collectively, the “Amalgamation”). In aggregate, holders of MagicMed Shares received 9,951,217 Company Shares representing approximately 31.7% of the Company Shares following the consummation of the Amalgamation. The maximum number of Company Shares to be issued by the Company as in respect of the Warrants and Converted Options shall not exceed 7,404,101 Company Shares.
 
The aggregate number of Company Shares that the Company issued in connection with the Amalgamation (collectively, the “Share Consideration”) was in excess of 20% of the Company’s pre-transaction outstanding Company Shares. Accordingly, the Company sought and received stockholder approval of the issuance of the Share Consideration in the Amalgamation in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Amalgamation Agreement, the Company appointed, effective as of the Effective Time two individuals selected by MagicMed to the Company Board of Directors, Dr. Joseph Tucker and Dr. Brad Thompson.
 
The Amalgamation Agreement contained representations and warranties, closing deliveries and indemnification provisions customary for a transaction of this nature. The closing of the Amalgamation was conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the Share Consideration being approved for listing on Nasdaq, (ii) the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 registering the Share Consideration (the “S-4 Registration Statement”) and (iii) the approval (a) of the MagicMed stockholders of the Amalgamation and (b) of the Company’s stockholders of each of the Amalgamation and the issuance of the Share Consideration in the Amalgamation. The closing of the Amalgamation occurred on September 16, 2021.
 
MagicMed Industries develops and commercializes psychedelic-derived pharmaceutical candidates. MagicMed’s psychedelic derivatives library, the Psybrary™, is an essential building block from which industry can develop new patented products. The initial focus of the Psybrary™ is on psilocybin and DMT derivatives, and it is then expected to be expanded to other psychedelics.
 
Psychedelics
 
Following our amalgamation with MagicMed completed in September 2021 (the “Amalgamation”), we have continued to pursue the development of MagicMed’s proprietary psychedelic derivatives library, the Psybrary™ which we believe will help us to identify and develop the right drug candidates needed to address mental health challenges, including cancer-related distress. We synthesize novel versions of classic psychedelics, such as psilocybin, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline and MDMA, using a mixture of chemistry and synthetic biology, resulting in the expansion of the Psybrary™, which includes 15 patent families with over a million potential variations and hundreds of synthesized molecules. Within the Psybrary™ we have three different types of molecules, Generation 1 (classic psychedelics), Generation 2 (pro-drugs), and Generation 3 (new chemical entities). The Company is working to add novel psychedelic molecular compounds and derivatives (“Psychedelic Derivatives”) on a regular basis through our work at Enveric Labs in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where we have a team of PhD scientists with expertise in synthetic biology and chemistry. To date we have created over 500 molecules that are housed in the Psybrary.

---


We screen newly synthesized molecules in the Psybrary™ through PsyAI™, a proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Leveraging AI systems is expected to reduce the time and cost of pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial development. We believe it streamlines pharmaceutical design by predicting ideal binding structures of molecules, manufacturing capabilities, and pharmacological effects to help determine ideal drug candidates, tailored to each indication. Each of these molecules that we believe are patentable can then be further screened to see how changes to its makeup alter its effects in order to synthesize additional new molecules. New compounds of sufficient purity are undergoing pharmacological screening, including non-clinical (receptors/cell lines), preclinical (animal), and ultimately clinical (human) evaluations. We intend to utilize our Psybrary™ and the AI tool to categorize and characterize the Psybrary™ substituents to focus on bringing more psychedelics-inspired molecules from discovery to the clinical phase.
 
Cannabinoids
 
We are also aiming to advance a pipeline of novel cannabinoid combination therapies for the side effects of cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
 
We intend to bring together leading oncology clinicians, researchers, academic and industry partners to develop both external proprietary products and a robust internal pipeline of product candidates aimed at improving quality of life and outcomes for cancer patients. We intend to evaluate options to out-license our proprietary technology as it moves along the regulatory pathway.
 
In developing our product candidates, we intend to focus on cannabinoids derived from non-hemp botanical sources, and synthetic materials containing no tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in order to comply with U.S. federal regulations. Of the potential cannabinoids to be used in therapeutic formulations, THC, which is responsible for the psychoactive properties of marijuana, can result in undesirable mood effects. Selected cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) candidates, on the other hand, have amounts of THC well below 0.1% and are not psychotropic and therefore more attractive candidates for translation into therapeutic practice. Drugs with less than 0.1% THC have a history, when approved as drugs by FDA, of being able to be rescheduled by DEA from Schedule I to Schedule V, as in the case of Epidiolex and Marinol. In the future, we may utilize cannabinoids that are derived from cannabis plants, which may contain higher amounts of THC; however, we only intend to do so in jurisdictions where THC is legal. However, synthetic THC is a Schedule I controlled substance; so, the use of any APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) containing synthetic THC (or naturally derived THC in concentrations greater than 0.3%) may increase regulatory scrutiny and require additional expenses and authorizations. All current and future product candidates that we are developing or may develop will be tested for safety and efficacy under an IND application and subject to the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) pre-market approval process for new drugs.
 
While we continue to pursue the development of our cannabinoid-based product candidates, our principal focus is on the development of psychedelic-based treatments.

Academic and Industry Partners

We have also established relationships with certain academic and industry partners, whom we believe have the potential to accelerate product development, market entry, data collection, analysis and advancement of clinical trials.
 
Our current academic and industry partners are set forth in the table below:
 

Name | Description 
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tikun Olam Ltd. | Tikun Olam Ltd. brings proprietary products and data, clinical research experience, and access to resources in Israel. 
St. George’s University of London | St. George’s University of London brings research capabilities and relevant domain expertise in cancer and cannabinoids. 
The Soroka Medical Cancer Center | The Soroka Medical Cancer Center brings clinical research capabilities and extensive patient access.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge and technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We intend to focus on the development of novel and viable Psychedelic Derivatives for mental illnesses and unmet medical needs, and partner with pharmaceutical and other drug development and biotechnology companies in developing and commercializing psychedelic-derived drugs for diverse psychological and neuropsychiatric indications, of which will be fundamentally composed of the Psychedelic Derivatives contained in the Psybrary™. While we believe that our technology, knowledge and experience as well as the scientific resources at our disposal provide us with significant competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. Any product candidates we successfully identify will compete not only with existing therapies but also new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
The diagnosis of Cancer Related Distress (CRD) has been characterized by neuropsychological (emotional, behavioral and cognitive), social, spiritual, and physical ailments. The diagnosis and treatment of cancer are associated with psychological distress which encompasses serious consequences that interfere with one’s ability to cope effectively and comply with treatment to ensure optimal outcome. Such distress extends along a continuum, ranging from common normal feelings of vulnerability, sadness, and fear to problems that can become disabling, such as depression, anxiety, panic, social isolation, and existential and spiritual crisis.
 
A growing awareness and body of literature surrounding CRD came to be defined in recent years; however, no approved treatment is available and there remains significant unmet need to treat CRD. Addressing CRD is among our goals in developing novel and viable Psychedelic Derivatives for mental illnesses and unmet medical needs includes.
 
We are currently working to advance a pipeline of novel cannabinoid combination therapies for hard-to-treat cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and several other indications. For the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), we believe that only one drug product (Epidiolex, developed by GW Pharmaceuticals) is a potential late-stage competitor to our GBM product candidate, EV101: Cannabinoid + Chemotherapy Combination Therapy. Other than Epidiolex, we are aware of exploratory research into the effects of cannabinoid drug formulations. We are also aware of discovery research within the pharmaceutical industry into synthetic agonists and antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors, as well as companies that supply synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis extracts to researchers for pre-clinical and clinical investigation, and various companies that cultivate cannabis plants with a view to supplying herbal cannabis or non-pharmaceutical cannabis-based formulations to patients. These therapies have not been approved by the FDA.

Patients suffering from GBM in the U.S. are treated with a variety of FDA-approved products, including, but not limited to, Bevacizumab, Carmustine Implant, Lomustine, and Temozolomide. Our potential competitors regarding the GBM product candidate include pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Genentech, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Next Source Pharmaceuticals, and Merck, among others, depending on when the candidate is approved for commercialization, if ever (and what, if any, new therapies are approved in the interim). Such competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved medicines than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our radiation dermatitis (also referred to as radiodermatitis) product candidate, EV102: Cannabinoid Cream for Topical skin Application, faces competition from Lutric Pharma, which has a topical B-Raf Inhibitor in Phase 1/2 studies that is intended to treat radiation dermatitis.


With respect to CBD, a number of non-approved and non-standardized CBD preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis have been made available in limited quantities by producers of “medical marijuana” in the U.S. We do not believe prescription cannabinoids are the same as distributing or legalizing crude herbal cannabis, or preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis, and therefore we do not believe they are competitive with, crude herbal cannabis. We believe that only a cannabinoid medication, one that is standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies, can meet the standards of regulatory authorities around the world, including those of the FDA. We also believe that these regulatory processes provide important protections for patients, and that any cannabinoid medication must be subjected to, and satisfy, such rigorous scrutiny.
 
Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for their medicines more rapidly than us, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
Regarding our Psybrary™ and the intellectual property kept and developed therein, our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our ability to achieve and maintain key partnerships aimed at the development, licensing and marketing of Psychedelic Derivatives without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Patent positions within the pharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, principally by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and, to a lesser extent, by state and local governments. Before our prescription products may be marketed in the U.S., they must be approved by the FDA for commercial distribution. Certain OTC products must comply with applicable FDA regulations, known as OTC Monographs, in order to be marketed, but do not have the benefit of FDA review and approval before marketing. We are also subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other present and future local, state, federal and foreign regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and other regulatory developments concerning our products and the healthcare industry in general.
 
The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, quality control, export and import, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, pricing, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements both before and after approval, can subject us, our third party manufacturers and other collaborative partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as, among other things, warning letters, fines and other monetary payments, recall or seizure of products, criminal proceedings, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, interruption or cessation of clinical trials, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, limitations on or the limitation of claims we can make for our products, and refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts for distribution directly by governmental agencies, or delay in approving or refusal to approve new drug applications. The FDA also has the authority to revoke or withhold approvals of new drug applications.

FDA approval is required before any “new drug,” can be marketed. Our products are new drugs and require prior FDA approval. Such approval must be based on extensive information and data submitted in a NDA, including, but not limited to, adequate and well controlled laboratory and clinical investigations to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for its intended use(s) as well as the manufacturing suitability of the product. In addition to providing required safety and effectiveness data for FDA approval, a drug manufacturer’s practices and procedures must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), which apply to manufacturing, receiving, holding and shipping, and include, among other things, demonstration of product purity, consistent manufacturing and quality and at least six months of data supporting product expiration dating based on clinical registration batches. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all applicable areas relating to quality assurance and regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMPs. Failure to so comply risks delays in approval of drug products and possible FDA enforcement actions, such as an injunction against shipment of products, the seizure of non-complying products, criminal prosecution and/or any of the other possible consequences described above. We are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), which inspections may or may not be announced in advance.
 
The intellectual property kept and developed in our Psybrary™ is focused solely on developing and commercializing non-hallucinogenic synthetic derivatives of psychedelic substances. While we use psychedelic inspired compounds and classic psychedelics as our starting point for our research and identification of compounds, we do not have any direct or indirect involvement in the illegal selling, production or distribution of any substances in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enveric is a neuro-pharmaceutical scientific company and as such we do not advocate for the legalization of psychedelic substances nor do we deal with psychedelic substances except within laboratory and clinical trial settings conducted within approved regulatory frameworks. Our products will not be commercialized prior to applicable regulatory approval and this approval will only be granted if clinical evidence of safety and efficacy for the specific intended use is successfully developed.
 
Successful execution of our strategy is in part contingent upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and obtaining regulatory approvals for the development and license of its Psychedelic Derivatives. The psychedelic therapy industry is a new and emerging industry with ambiguous existing regulations and uncertainty as to future regulations; we cannot predict the impact of the ever-evolving compliance regime in respect of this industry. The impact of compliance regimes, any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact our development of markets, our business, Psychedelic Derivatives, and licensing initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
FDA New Drug Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.



-12-
----


Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND application is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND application or otherwise commented or questioned the IND application within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND application may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with GCP (“Good Clinical Practice”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application.


The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general, in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
 
If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee.

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months of review are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity (NME).
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
Special Protocol Assessment
 
A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or “SPA”, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDCA and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and the FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.

Advertising and Promotion
 
Pre-approval promotion of investigational drug candidates is prohibited by the FDA. Therefore, sponsors must ensure that any pre-approval communications disseminated about its drug candidates do not state or imply that such candidates have been proven safe or effective for the applicable use(s) or that they have been approved for commercialization in the United States. Further, once an NDA for a given candidate is approved, if ever, the product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs.
 
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, may require under a REMS special communication regarding the safety of the drug or heightened surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or “BPCA”, provides NDA holders a six-month period of exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with the FDA — patent or non-patent — for a drug, if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA, of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory time frame. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or “PREA”, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. Under PREA, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter requesting a response within 45 days to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

Controlled Substances
 
The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or “CSA”, and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”). The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S., and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Marijuana is currently a Schedule I controlled substance, which means that no preclinical or clinical studies of product candidates containing marijuana may be conducted in the United States without the required DEA registration(s) and related approvals, as applicable. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.
 
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincidental activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
 
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedules I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer (not a dosage form manufacturer or a repacker/relabeler) for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 60 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is simultaneously forwarded by DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance.
 
Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedules I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances.
 
As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedules I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedules I and II substance or Schedules III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedules III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary to ensure that the U.S. complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.
 

-16-
----


For drugs manufactured in the U.S., the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 
The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales (including pricing and reimbursement) and distribution of our product candidates, if approved.
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.

In the European Union, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. Additional rules also apply at the national level to the manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution and sale of controlled substances. In many European Union member states the regulatory authority responsible for medicinal products is also responsible for controlled substances. Responsibility is, however, split in some member states. Generally, any company manufacturing or distributing a medicinal product containing a controlled substance in the European Union will need to hold a controlled substances license from the competent national authority and will be subject to specific record-keeping and security obligations. Separate import or export certificates are required for each shipment into or out of the member state.
 
Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND application prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or “CTA”, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a company has received favorable ethics committee approval, clinical trial development may proceed in that country.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying European Union legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization, or “ICH”, guidelines on GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.

To obtain regulatory approval to place a drug on the market in European Union countries, Enveric must submit a marketing authorization application. This application is similar to the NDA in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, or CTD, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical and clinical trial information. Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, (iii) the decentralized procedure, or (iv) national authorization procedures.
 
The European Commission created the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union and, by extension (after national implementing decisions) in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which, together with the European Union Member States, comprise the European Economic Area, or “EEA”. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the EMA (European Medicines Agency), where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases), and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the voluntary request of the applicant also be used for human drugs that do not fall within the above-mentioned categories if the CHMP agrees that the human drug (a) contains a new active substance not yet approved on November 20, 2005; (b) constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or (c) authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients at the European Union level. Since the U.K. exited the E.U., it no longer falls under these regulations, however, it has been decided it will follow EMA as it is transitioning to regulations as defined by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has temporary arrangements in place to partially align with EU regulations around medical technology including the sale of CE-marked medical devices until June 2023 and approval of EU-authorized medicines using a mutual recognition procedure until the end of 2023.
 
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum time frame for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter.
 
Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.
 
For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (i) the mutual recognition procedure (which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other European Union member state, and in which the European Union member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other European Union member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health), (ii) the decentralized procedure (in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more European Union member states), or (iii) national authorization procedures (which results in a marketing authorization in a single European Union member state).
 
Mutual Recognition Procedure
 
The mutual recognition procedure, or “MRP”, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Fundamentally, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and must be used if the product has already been authorized in one or more European Union member states.

The MRP functions by building on an already-existing marketing authorization in a member state of the European Union which is used as a reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other European Union member states. Under the MRP, if a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the European Union and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other European Union member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. The concerned member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the reference member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health.
 
The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by European Union member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.
 
Should any European Union member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a time frame of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the European Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products.


Data Exclusivity
 
In the European Union, marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
Orphan Medicinal Products
 
The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the European Commission adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of a marketing authorization application and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product, unless it offers a significant clinical benefit. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Pediatric Development
 
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or “PIP”, with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP unless a waiver applies, for example, because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if the product covered by it qualifies for one at the time of approval). This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
In addition, most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to us obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our product candidates to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In that case, we would be unable to market our product candidates in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all.
 
Employees 
 
We continue to build on our leadership expertise. We employ 23 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We also work with scientific advisors, consultants and service providers, mainly through academic institutions and contract research organizations.


We have never had a work stoppage and none of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of its business. We do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
