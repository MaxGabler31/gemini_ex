ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview



US Lighting Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in the State of Florida on October 17, 2003, under the name Luxurious Travel Corp., in order to develop, market and distribute a hotel booking engine software that interfaces and captures various rate channels and inventory controls for hotel reservations. The system allowed users to market, manage and sell hotel reservations, and to produce invoices, track follow up and manage customer relationships.



The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of US Lighting Group, Inc. (founded in 2013 in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming) on July 13, 2016, and the corporate name was changed on August 9, 2016, to the US Lighting Group, Inc. At the time the Company designed and manufactured commercial LED lighting, both for retrofits and new construction. Applications included commercial spaces such as board rooms, offices, factories, stores, gymnasiums, schools, hospitals, warehouses, and greenhouses, as well as some residential applications such as garages. Distribution channels included Home Depot and a chain of regional dealers.



On December 1, 2016, the Company acquired Intellitronix Corp. (“Intellitronix”), an Ohio corporation founded in 1998. Intellitronix was a designer and a US-based manufacturer of automotive electronic products such as digital and analog gauges, electronic accessories and ignition boxes. The products were sold through aftermarket distributors, as well consumer direct and through some OEM channels. At the time of acquisition Intellitronix already had access to the automotive electronics market and had an established distributor and consumer base.



Through supplying Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s) with electronic components the Company was introduced to the Recreational Vehicle (RV) Industry. Management identified a fast growing and underserved niche of small, tow-behind fully molded fiberglass travel trailers. The Company started developing a new business plan to create a luxury 17’ Travel Camper to appeal to young professionals working remotely as well as retirees and other consumers intrigued by the travelling lifestyle.



On May 14, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Ohio INTX Cooperative, a Northeast Ohio based non-profit organization, to sell off selected assets of Intellitronix, an automotive electronics manufacturer, serving a niche market of aftermarket electronics for customer installations as well as several emerging OEM applications, to pursue the new business direction in the RV industry. Financial results for the year ending December 31, 2021, include revenue of $1,514,000 from discontinued operations of Intellitronix.



On January 11, 2021, the Company formed Cortes Campers, LLC (“Cortes Campers”), a wholly owned subsidiary, to operate its new brand of innovative travel trailers. During the second part of 2021 the Company began marketing efforts and established a dealer network as well as production planning for the 17’ Camper with the goal of starting camper deliveries in 2022.



The Company plans to expand its manufacturing footprint, enhance production techniques, and develop more products in the RV, marine, composite housing, and electronics sectors.

Industry Facts



According to Recreational Vehicle Industry Association research, the RV industry has demonstrated growth over the last several years with an unprecedented surge in 2021. Total RV shipments for 2021 increased 39.5% over the 430,412 units shipped in 2020. Towable RVs, led by conventional travel trailers, ended 2021 up 39.6% against 2020 with 544,028 wholesale shipments. 



Reasons for growth are attributed to a general increase in popularity, rising household incomes and new demographics entering the market. The Covid-19 pandemic further fueled interest in RV recreation as more people were able to work remotely. RV trips also became a preferred mode of tourism for many Americans as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the traditional travel.



A Recreational Vehicle Industry Association study found RV ownership has increased over 62% in the last twenty years, with a record 11.2 million RV owning households. These households were split almost equally between those over and under the age of 55, with significant growth among 18-to-34-year-olds which, makes up 22 percent of the market. Additionally, 9.6 million households intend to buy an RV within the next five years. Among current RV owners who plan to buy another RV in the next five year, the numbers for Millennials and Generation Z stand out, with 84% of 18-to-34-year-olds planning to buy another RV, with a 78% preferring to buy a new model.



According to a Facts & Factors research report, the global RV Market was estimated at USD 51 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 77 billion by 2026.



The increased demand for RV units also fuels innovation as manufacturers are looking to satisfy the needs of a new, younger demographic, most of whom are first time buyers.



Cortes Campers saw these market trends as an opportunity to introduce lightweight, towable, composite-built campers that feature luxury amenities in a small footprint.

Principal Products 



Traditional RVs are built using wooden structures and corrugated aluminum shells, also referred to in the industry as “Sticks and Tin” construction, or with aluminum skeleton and fiberglass wall panels also known as “laminated” RVs. While these methods dominate the manufacturing landscape of the industry, traditional RVs are known for frequent structural damage, mold and rot, fast deterioration, and lack the ability to perform in harsher, colder environments.



Additionally, both manufacturing techniques require highly skilled manual labor in such fields as carpentry, wood-working and interior finish.



Molded composite manufacturing, including fiberglass, has been the primary construction process for many high-tech industries such as aerospace, wind power industry and marine. Composite materials offer unparalleled structural integrity, while being lightweight and resistant to elements. Molded construction relies on the master mold, which consistently yields production units with minimal variances.



Cortes Campers’ first product is a seventeen (17) foot long single axle tow-behind molded fiberglass Camper. The innovative design further improves upon construction techniques currently used by the RV industry as described above. Drawing from expertise in the marine industry, the Company replaces all wood with composite alternatives or corrosion resistant materials, producing a truly durable camper designed to last a lifetime. Other innovations include axle-less independent suspension, corrosion resistant chassis, four-season insulation, and externally mounted propane heaters.



Amenities include a gas oven, and 3-Burner Cooktop, microwave oven, 8.0 cubic ft refrigerator, kitchen workstation, bathroom and shower, air conditioner, LED Television as well as ample storage and many large windows. The camper sleeps two and is rated at 3,500lb maximum towable weight. These amenities are not typically available in competitor campers of this size.



Manufacturing Process



The manufacturing of molded fiberglass products involves constant cycling of master molds that require curing time before the finished parts can be pulled out. Currently Cortes Campers are built out of a single mold for each body component, however, more molds can be created to increase the number of campers that can be produced. Each mold can be cycled once a day.



The fabrication schedule includes processes such as gel coat spray application, fiberglass lamination, reinforcement, curing time, cutting and final assembly.



Manufacturing is currently performed by MigMarine Corp, an affiliated entity, which rents a part of the 26,000 square foot manufacturing facility owned by the Company. It is the Company’s goal to bring manufacturing fully in house, however it has been simultaneously exploring relationships with various vendors which could be used as an outsourcing network to increase capacity.



Distribution and Current Market 



Cortes Campers, has established a network of professional RV and automotive dealerships to market and distribute its products.

Dealership rights have been granted on exclusive territory basis and require dealers to purchase a minimum number of campers annually to retain their exclusive distribution rights.

While this distribution model is somewhat traditional for most RV manufacturers, it is unique to Cortes Campers when compared to other molded fiberglass travel trailer competitors, who supply their boutique-type product directly to consumers.



We believe access to established dealers with significant market presence allows Cortes Campers to achieve faster market penetration. Dealers have been very receptive to the Company’s campers, due to its unique design and additional amenities in the tow- behind camper market.



The Company continues its efforts in developing distribution partners in North America and beyond.



Patents



The Company is in the process of obtaining access to intellectual property that should enable meaningful product innovation and significant cost reductions in the future. The pending patent below for an Energy Management System has already been obtained by Cortes Campers, from the inventor, US Lighting Group’s majority shareholder.
Patent Application No.: 17/568878 ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR A RECREATIONAL VEHICLE



Suppliers – International and Domestic 



Raw materials utilized in composite manufacturing include fiberglass, gelcoats, and resins. Materials used in final assembly are custom fabricated chassis, water tanks, wheels and tires, appliances, electrical, plumbing and other interior components. Currently Cortes Campers’ specifications call for materials that can be sourced domestically from United States or Canadian based manufacturers and suppliers. However, many of those components have origin in Asia, and recent supply chain disruptions, driven by Covid-19 pandemic as well as increased demand for recreational vehicle components, might dramatically alter the supplier base of the Company and its vendors.
Competition



Cortes Campers directly competes with several small, molded fiberglass camper manufacturers such as Casita, Oliver Travel Trailers, and Scamp. Another notable competitor is Airstream. Indirect competition includes traditionally built tow-behind campers in the same length from large RV manufacturers such as Thor, Forest River and Jayco.
Product Safety



Cortes’ campers are registered with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and conform to all applicable safety standards.
