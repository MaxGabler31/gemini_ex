Overview
Welcome to the Traegerhood
Our mission is to bring people together to create a more flavorful world.
Traeger is the creator and category leader of the wood pellet grill, an outdoor cooking system that ignites all-natural hardwoods to grill, smoke, bake, roast, braise, and barbecue. Our Traeger grills are versatile and easy to use, empowering cooks of all skill sets to create delicious meals with a wood-fired flavor that cannot be replicated with gas, charcoal, or electric grills.
At the heart of our brand is a passionate and engaged community called the Traegerhood, which includes everyone from casual grillers to competition pitmasters and professional chefs. Our flagship wood pellet grills are internet of things, or IoT, devices that allow owners to program, monitor, and control their grill through our Traeger app, which is used on more than 1.8 million mobile devices per month. We complement our innovative cooking technologies with an extensive digital library of original recipes and Traeger Kitchen Live cooking classes. In addition, we offer consumable products, such as wood pellets, rubs, and sauces, that drive recurring revenue.
Leveraging our authentic brand and the Traegerhood, we have established an omnichannel distribution strategy led by retailers ranging from Ace Hardware and The Home Depot to Wayfair and Williams Sonoma. We complement this retail channel with direct to consumer sales through our website and Traeger app. We believe this accessibility has fueled our growth, as we have increased our revenue from $363.3 million in 2019 to $785.5 million in 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 29%.
Today, we estimate that 60% of U.S. households own a grill, representing a total addressable market of approximately 75 million households in the United States. With approximately 2.5 million Traegers sold in the United States from 2017 to 2021, we estimate that our U.S. household penetration is only 3% of this total addressable market. As a result, we believe our potential market opportunity is massive and that our ability to grow within and beyond the outdoor grill market is unrivaled. We see opportunities to expand our integrated, connected cooking platform with new types of technologies and experiences. Together with the Traegerhood, we are disrupting home cooking.
The Traeger
Before we invented the Traeger, the age-old practice of cooking with wood could be challenging. It was difficult to ignite the wood, maintain consistent temperatures, and create the right amount of smoke for flavoring. With the advent of cooking methods such as electricity and gas, wood-fired cooking was, for a time, relegated to barbecue pitmasters and high-end restaurants. Nevertheless, cooking with wood can simply make food taste better. If done correctly, wood offers distinct flavors, and different types of woods can be used independently or in combination to introduce flavors that we believe are otherwise difficult to create.
The Traeger simplifies the process of cooking with wood and empowers everyone from a casual griller to a professional chef to create delicious meals that we believe cannot be replicated with gas-, electric- or charcoal-based cooking systems. Our grills use an auger to feed natural hardwood pellets into a fire pot, where they are ignited by a hot rod to create consistent heat and flavorful smoke. A fan stokes the fire and creates convection, which is key to the versatility of our grills. The Traeger monitors the temperature and adjusts the auger and fan to maintain consistent cooking conditions. All of this is accomplished by pressing a button and setting a temperature. We believe our wood pellet grills offer the following advantages:
•Taste: Hardwood smoke can make beef, pork, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and baked goods taste delicious. Wood-fired cooking suits numerous eating styles and diets including paleo, ketogenic, gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan.
•Versatility: The Traeger is able to grill, smoke, bake, roast, braise, and barbecue. Culinary traditions from around the world are represented in the Traeger recipe collection. 
•Ease of Use: Connected Traegers can be programmed via smartphone to accomplish multi-hour cook cycles with minimal supervision. Thanks to this accessible user experience, even new Traeger owners can cook recipes ranging from barbecue ribs, Moroccan ground meat kebabs, and teriyaki-glazed cod to wood-fired pizza, focaccia bread, and chocolate chip cookies to smoked guacamole, blistered curry cauliflower, and pasta salad.
Table of Contents

•Consistency: By automatically monitoring and maintaining the set temperature, the Traeger cooks food with minimal supervision, creating consistent results each session.
•Community: The Traeger brings friends, family, and neighbors together for memorable meals. These elevated experiences motivate the Traegerhood to support members with recipe ideas, photos, and tips.
Based on a survey we commissioned in 2017, owners of a Traeger and at least one other grill overwhelmingly preferred their Traeger in a head-to-head comparison against gas and charcoal grills, and approximately 90% of Traeger owners indicated that they planned to buy a wood pellet grill again as their next grill. We believe the Traeger outcompetes other outdoor cooking solutions because it creates mouth-watering results and transforms cooking from a chore into an enjoyable and cherished experience. Our grill owners proudly call it “Traegering.”
Our Products and Integrated, Connected Cooking Platform
The Original
In 1987, we invented the original wood pellet grill. The original Traeger helped to transform outdoor cooking by making it easy to enjoy the delicious flavors of wood-fired food. Prior to the original Traeger, cooking with wood fire was difficult and there was no efficient way to ignite the wood, maintain consistent temperatures, and create the right amount of smoke. The original Traeger helped to solve these challenges, making it easier for home cooks to achieve extraordinary culinary results.
The Reinvented Original
We’ve come a long way since 1987 and have made significant improvements to our grills and technologies. Along the way, our product design has been centered on our core concepts of taste, versatility, ease of use, consistency, and community.
Beginning in 2014, we pioneered a digital outdoor cooking experience. Using software, internet connectivity, and cloud technology, we reinvented the original Traeger to be an internet of things, or IoT, device featuring a variety of modern technologies, including:
•WiFIRE technology – Utilizes cloud-computing, our Traeger app, and our cloud-connected grills to enable users to automate recipe steps and control and monitor their grill from anywhere in the world using their smartphone.
•D2 Direct Drive – An automated control system that maintains grill temperature to +/-5 degrees of set temperature through fans and DC auger control.
•Super Smoke Mode – A proprietary cooking mode that maximizes production of hardwood smoke to infuse flavors into food.
•Pellet Sensor – A connected sensor that measures wood pellet levels and communicates with our Traeger app, enabling users to monitor fuel levels and receive alerts when fuel gets low. 
•TurboTemp – A rapid startup system that brings the grill to cooking temperature and reacts quickly to temperature changes.
Today, our wood pellet grills feature modern, updated designs that improve upon the original. Our grills use an auger to feed natural hardwood pellets into a fire pot, where they are ignited by a hot rod to create heat and flavorful smoke. A fan stokes the fire and creates convection, which is key to the versatility of our grills. A drip tray funnels the grease, fat, and oil to an external bucket to help prevent flareups and simplify cleanup.
Our Integrated Platform
Our integrated platform includes four types of products: wood pellet grills, digital content, the Traeger app and consumables, including our premium frozen meal kits. We integrate these products to optimize the cooking experience and produce valuable feedback loops with consumers.
As an example of how our integrated platform works, consider a new Timberline grill owner that is looking to use their grill for the first time and is interested in trying their hand at a brisket. This owner might search our website for ideas and find our beginner-rated Smoked Midnight Brisket recipe, which calls for four of our consumable products. The owner also finds that we offer a brisket meal kit box (through our "Traeger Provisions" brand) that includes high-quality pre-trimmed Wagyu beef brisket, all the seasonings and other items needed for the cook, such as butcher paper and side dishes, and step-by-step 
Table of Contents

instructions for every aspect of the cook. After buying the Provisions brisket box or purchasing the ingredients and supplies separately, including our sauces or spice rubs and a grill cleaning accessory from a nearby retailer, the owner might then use the Traeger app to program this recipe into the grill. During the 12-hour cook cycle, the owner may then read a Traeger tutorial on “How to Slice a Brisket Against the Grain.” After producing a delicious, well-cut brisket, the owner may share their experience with others offline or online via social media, which can lead or encourage others to buy a Traeger and start their own cycle. If the owner likes the food and experience, they are also likely to use more Traeger recipes and buy more consumables.
As a result, our integrated platform can drive grill usage, brand affinity, word of mouth, and purchases of our consumables.

Our accessories represented 13.4% and 6.3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Marketing
Following the launch of the original Traeger in 1987, a dedicated community began to form around the Traeger experience. Our strategy has been to harness the power of this community and strategically grow our brand using a “win where it matters” approach, which focuses on core demographics that are aligned with our brand, from the barbecue world to the outdoors and culinary spaces.
With this targeted approach, we have maintained a unique sense of authenticity as the creator of a cooking experience that welcomes everyone from casual backyard grillers to James Beard Award-winning chefs. Our marketing strategy has produced organic growth by building relationships, having a strong brand presence at industry and culinary events, and winning the “hearts and minds” of consumers with an authentic brand backed by devoted followers. We have grown the brand by extending that playbook to new communities and geographic regions, all without losing our focus on engaging with existing grill owners.
Our Marketing Team
Our team consists of members across a broad range of functions and perspectives, including brand marketing, digital marketing, retail product marketing, culinary, events management, creative, consumer insights, and customer experience. We bring experiences from leading consumer, lifestyle, and technology brands to the table and, collectively, we share a passion for the consumer and empathy for how our brand interacts with their lives.
Our Marketing Channels
Table of Contents

With our community as a foundation, we have scaled and increased broader consumer awareness through omnichannel initiatives. At the center of our efforts is a relentless focus on the customer journey, which starts with initial awareness of the Traeger brand and continues through purchasing and beyond. The purchase of the grill is just the beginning, as we assist with onboarding and provide supplemental content and personalized recipe recommendations to help owners continue to cook and improve their skills and repertoire. We aim to provide experiences that transform cooking from a chore into a craft and deliver pinnacle moments for the consumer as they incorporate their Traeger into holidays, celebrations, milestones and get-togethers.
We have invested significantly in our initiatives to increase broader consumer awareness of our brand and wood pellet grills. From 2019 to 2021, we invested $103.4 million to accelerate brand-building initiatives, including $58.4 million in 2021. We utilize the following key channels to engage with existing and potential customers:
•Social Media – Our social media sites serve not only as places for consumers to discover and learn about our brand, but also as home base for the Traegerhood to gather, grow their skills, get inspired, and share their passion. Social media allows our community to stay aware of current cooking trends and consume our dedicated Traeger content across a variety of social media platforms. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1.1 million Instagram followers and 498,000 Facebook followers, an increase of approximately 138,000 and 67,000 from the prior year, respectively.

We leverage our ambassador relationships to produce recipes, live cooking classes, and other branded content. We equip our community ambassadors with free grills suited to their unique needs and ensure they’re stocked with necessary supplies like wood pellets and accessories. In addition to providing complimentary products, we compensate some of our top-tier partners that participate in content shoots and Traeger events or provide custom content or recipes.
•Advertising – We have taken a digital-first approach across our advertising, investing in measurable channels across search, social media, connected television, and video. In addition, we have found success in complementing digital media with traditional media channels, such as linear and cable television, outdoor advertising, and radio, to achieve broader reach among our target audiences. We utilize a mixture of brand and product marketing messages to drive brand awareness, educate around the benefits of our product solution, increase purchase intent, and generate measurable growth as part of our performance marketing initiatives.

While we also market these accessories via our various other marketing channels, including Traeger.com, consumers can access the most MEATER-related content via MEATER.com, including all of the available MEATER product offerings (which are also available via the MEATER store on Amazon.com), a variety of recipes and product support resources, such as frequently asked questions and instructional videos for using the MEATER smart thermometers.
•Retail Product Marketing – We build strong relationships with retailers that align directly with our growth strategy. These relationships allow us to create engaging brand experiences, including customized Traeger shop-in-shop concepts and merchandising fixtures. We know that many consumers want to physically lift the lid of a Traeger and talk to someone with knowledge before making a purchase decision, so we strive to ensure that our retailers’ employees are 
Table of Contents

trained to offer expert guidance and product information. Our retailers range from nationwide chains to independent barbecue shops and play a role in our awareness efforts by integrating us into their advertising campaigns.
•Consumer Events – Serving Traeger-made food is a powerful way to introduce people to our product. Our goal is to create a branded presence that gives people a taste of our brand flavor along with their food samples, resulting in a compelling, memorable experience. We go to sales conventions, barbecue competitions, food and wine festivals, retailer events, and more with a dedicated team of community ambassadors. This team is staffed with activation experts who know how to create a memorable experience with a layer of fun and flair that stands out from the crowd and challenges the status quo. 
Sales
We have two primary sales channels: retail and DTC. Our retail channel covers our relationships with brick-and-mortar retailers, e-commerce platforms, and multichannel retailers. Our products are available at more than 12,700 retail locations in the United States as of December 31, 2021.
We have built relationships with well-known national retailers, such as The Home Depot, Ace Hardware and Costco. We also work with a significant number of independent retailers that cater to local communities and specific categories, such as hardware, camping, outdoor, farm, ranch, and barbecue. Our DTC channel covers sales directly to customers through our website and Traeger app.
Sales Organization Structure
Our sales team is dedicated to maximizing retail channel productivity. In the United States, our sales organization has three directors covering three territories: West, Central and East. Beneath the directors, territory managers oversee areas within our territories. In addition, we have leaders and teams covering specific areas of our business, including:
•National hardware, big box and buying groups, such as The Home Depot and Ace Hardware;
•Club businesses, such as Costco;
•Specialty sales, such as outdoor channels and furniture, appliance and grocery stores; and
•International sales.
Our Field Sales Team focuses on supporting our retailers at the ground level. Whether they are training staff members, setting up merchandise displays, or cooking on location over the weekend, they aim to become an extension of our retailers’ teams to drive awareness, sell-through, and brand advocacy.
Our sales team also focuses on in-person experiences and education. Since 2020 they have conducted more than 3,400 roadshows and demo events per year. Roadshow events take place at retail locations and special events, like the Texas State Fair and Cowboy Christmas.
As of December 31, 2021, our sales organization included approximately 330 directors, managers, and sales team members.
Built for Symbiotic Relationships
By sending our sales team into the field, we have built face-to-face relationships with retail executives and staff, and we have established deep roots with retail category leaders. Anecdotally, we know that a number of executive team members at these retailers are Traeger owners and advocates.
We believe that retailers value Traeger’s aspirational brand and premium reputation. They also appreciate how our wood pellets, rubs, and sauces bring shoppers through the door frequently and can lead to purchases of unrelated goods. Many of these retailers offer free assembly and delivery of grills at our price points, which gives our owners a high-touch experience when our product first arrives at their home.
Retail Employee Programs
We work to transform retail associates into advocates for our brand and products. We aim to accomplish this through two primary programs:
Table of Contents

•Certified Traeger Pro – We identify and invite promising retail associates to our Salt Lake City headquarters for a day and a half of intensive training on all things Traeger, including our product line and brand, so that they can better educate customers at their respective retail locations.
•Employee Purchase Program – We enable retail associates to purchase their own Traeger at a significant discount. We find that associates who own a Traeger and have tasted the food are more likely to recommend the product to grill shoppers. They are also able to provide a more compelling and informed sales experience.
Overall, we aim to provide the best retail experience at selective points of sales, and we strive to maximize productivity rather than door count.
Product Development
Product Mission
Our Product team’s mission is to develop world-class innovation with flawless product commercialization and 4.8-star or higher consumer ratings to enhance the consumer cooking experience from beginning to end. These high standards are essential to our strategy of selling a premium product with mass market appeal. Product innovation can also increase our pricing and encourage customers to replace their grills more often than the average grill owner.
As of December 31, 2021, our Product team consisted of approximately 50 members. Our team aims to build upon our core concepts of taste, versatility, ease of use, consistency, and community. Since 2014, our team has re-envisioned the outdoor cooking archetype with digital experiences and has developed and leveraged our intellectual property to help build a moat around our business.
Department Structure
Our product department is headed by a Product Leader with direct reports that lead three pillars of product development:
•Category – Our Category team identifies unmet needs and drives a business case for solving them. Team members manage our commercialized product lines and focus on future innovations for our product portfolio. The team also decides which products to keep, revise, or discontinue, and with what timing.
•Design – The Design team focuses on user experience, including the structure of components, the way products are used, and human factors (e.g., average height) that shape the experience. The team aims to design experiences that are valuable, useful, usable, findable, credible, desirable, and accessible.
•Engineering – The Engineering team includes mechanical and electrical engineers who ensure that products can meet the requirements set forth by the Category and Design teams. The team prototypes and tests products through a comprehensive performance engineering and compliance process. The team also ensures that products meet governmental safety standards as well as our high standards for performance and user experience. The Engineering team collaborates with our manufacturers and, once this process is finalized, commercial-scale production begins.
Nimble Process
We are a consumer insights led, innovation focused, matrixed organization working in a concurrent fashion. Our category business team and teams covering brand and sales, sourcing, quality, manufacturing, and sales and operations planning work with our Product team throughout the innovation, development, and commercialization processes. With this strategy, we eliminate the traditional handoffs that can exist between siloed teams and slow innovation or lead to products that fail to meet business, design, and engineering requirements. We believe this “Nimble” process can give us an edge over slower-moving and legacy competitors.
Insights from Everywhere
To produce the best cooking experience possible, we gather insights from every step and decision in the cooking process with the objective of identifying unmet needs. We believe everyone at our company contributes to this process. Insights from sales, marketing, operations, customer service, and other departments feed our innovations and drive creative, outside the box thinking.
Table of Contents

Our Product team also conducts “in-habitat” observations to see how Traeger owners use our products in their own backyard. These studies have helped us to recognize problems and unmet needs that lead to new product categories, design principles, and engineering standards.
Product Accomplishments
Our Product team is responsible for launching our flagship technologies, including WiFIRE, D2 Direct Drive, Pellet Sensor, Super Smoke, and TurboTemp. Other important but less visible product improvements and accomplishments include:
•Reduced the estimated average assembly time for our Century grill from 2.5 to 1 hours while also decreasing the cost of the grill.
•Achieved a Good Design Award for the Timberline, which supported a higher average retail equivalent price for our grills and established us as an innovative leader in the industry with patented IoT technology.
•Achieved the Best Consumer Reports score in all grill categories with our Ironwood model while reducing the cost of our IoT technology.
Human Capital and Culture
We believe that the Traeger culture and people differentiate us from competitors by enabling us to sustain product innovation, engage our community, elevate our brand, and form strong partnerships over the long term. We observe that many other cooking brands produce one compelling innovation and then merely add incremental features. We changed the outdoor cooking landscape with the original wood pellet grill, and we did so again with the first cloud-connected offering in the category. We believe our culture and people will permit us to continue the disruption in outdoor cooking and potentially expand it into other ancillary areas of the at home cooking market.
Mission and Values
In our model, culture precedes strategy and process. Choices about how we grow and operate the company stem from our core values, which help to attract and retain talented people from within and beyond our industry. We hire for risk tolerance, intellectual curiosity, passion, humility, and a drive to do “big things.” We teach hires the Traeger culture and strategy and then toss them into the proverbial deep end. We celebrate their successes and help them learn from their mistakes, but do not allow them to fail.
Although we may share a number of common values with other companies, the exact wording of our values is unique to Traeger and known only to our employees and closest partners. These values are the foundation upon which we innovate products, build community, share our brand, and build partnerships. We summarize these values as follows:
•We emphasize quality, taking pride in masterful execution, down to the tiniest detail.
•We test the status quo, take calculated risks, and think disruptively.
•We work as a team and strive to bring out the best in our teammates.
•We continuously learn, develop, and refine ourselves.
•We create a positive experience for every retailer and customer, no matter what it takes.
Diversity and inclusion are key components of our culture and are fundamental to achieving our strategic priorities and future vision. At Traeger, inclusion, equity and diversity mean welcoming everyone to our table, and we believe the collective sum of our individual differences creates the unmistakable Traeger community and enables innovation.
We are a "Great Place to Work" certified employer and have a strong track record of selectivity and retention. We believe that we are among the most attractive employers in the Salt Lake City and the greater Mountain West areas. Many of our employees live the Traeger lifestyle at home with their own grills and at our office, with its outdoor barbecue deck and test kitchen.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 875 employees, of which approximately 850 were full-time. We also retain consultants, independent contractors and temporary and part-time workers. Our employees are located in 37 states and 10 countries, with approximately 725 located in the United States. Our employees are divided across several core functions, including sales and marketing, supply chain management, product development, wood pellet manufacturing, and culinary and

talent management. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages.
Our people are essential to our success, and we expect headcount to grow for the foreseeable future as we focus on recruiting employees with experience to continue to bolster various functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company and to support our expected growth.
Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Logistics
We have developed an efficient and scalable global supply chain with a continued focus on improving products and services while reducing costs. The supply chain organization includes global planning, retail operations, third party manufacturing and logistics providers, vertically integrated wood pellet manufacturing, program management and customer experience teams. Our internal supply chain management team oversees our global supply chain and includes personnel in the United States and China. Our operations in China are dedicated to quality control, product engineering and supply chain logistics, and includes employees that monitor the production quality of our manufacturers and suppliers. This team in China also works to identify new manufacturing capacity as needed, and manages the transfer of technology between suppliers to manage our supply chain risk. Our internal supply chain management team supports product introductions and evolving channel strategies, researches materials and equipment, qualifies suppliers and potential manufacturers, directs internal demand and production planning, manages product purchasing plans and oversees product transportation. Our personnel also work with our third-party manufacturers to monitor product quality and manufacturing process efficiency.
We utilize third-party manufacturers to manufacture and supply our grills and accessories. Our grills are manufactured by three manufacturers located in China and one manufacturer located in Vietnam, and we outsource the production of our accessories and apparel to a global network of suppliers. The raw materials and components used in our grills are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our manufacturers from a variety of suppliers. Similarly, the raw materials for our hardwood pellets are sourced directly by us, and from local sources wherever possible. Our supply chain management team coordinates the relationships and commercial terms between our manufacturers and the suppliers of raw material and components that we have sourced directly. We regularly review our existing manufacturers and suppliers globally, and evaluate new manufacturers and suppliers, to ensure that we can scale our manufacturing base and strategically position our operations to mitigate risk related to geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures as we grow. For additional discussion relating to the availability of raw materials used for our business, please see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Significant increases in the cost of raw materials for our wood pellet facilities or our suppliers suffering from operating or financial difficulties could adversely impact revenue and our ability to satisfy customer demand" and "Risk Factors—Fluctuations in the cost and availability as well as delays of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation could cause manufacturing delays or increase our costs."
We generally purchase from our primary manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Pursuant to our internal policies and terms with such parties, our manufacturers must follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed preferred relationships with our manufacturers to maintain access to the resources needed to scale and ensure our manufacturers have the requisite experience to produce our grills and related accessories, and work closely with our manufacturers to improve their yields and efficiency. We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment that is specifically required to manufacture our products in order to have control of supply and component pipelines. We have purchase commitments based on our purchase orders for certain amounts of goods, work-in-progress, and components.
We produce our wood pellets through a vertically integrated network of seven wood pellet production facilities and a select number of contract manufacturers capable of meeting our specifications in the United States. This network includes an owned and operated facility in New York and leased facilities in Oregon, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia. Our facilities are strategically located across the United States near hardwood inputs and key customer distribution centers. We believe operating these facilities gives us greater control over production and supply, and we pay for and own certain tooling and equipment at these facilities in order to maintain product quality and supply requirements, including the specific moisture content of our wood pellets. We are committed to continuous improvement in our wood pellet production operations. We have implemented a quality management system designed to ensure delivery of consistent, high-quality wood pellets, especially as our production volumes have increased.
We utilize multiple third-party logistics providers for a significant portion of our distribution and fulfillment operations, which include warehousing and shipping. Our third-party logistics providers have warehouses in California, Georgia, Texas and Washington, with warehouses dedicated to specific, high-volume single channel products and DTC sales. Our wood pellet production facilities have the capacity to store batches of finished wood pellets on site, and send finished goods to our third-party providers for further warehousing and distribution to our customers. Our inventory is managed by these third-party

logistics providers, which interface with our material resources planning, or MRP, system to enable us to maintain visibility and control over inventory levels and customer shipments. We maintain a third-party logistics providers in the Netherlands and Canada to support our international growth. We believe our providers have sufficient expansion capacity to meet our future needs, and that our distribution and fulfillment strategy has improved the efficiency and scalability of our operations.
We manage inventory through a third-party MRP system. We forecast demand based on market inputs and generate SKU and rolling 18-month forecasts. The MRP system incorporates our forecasts, existing inventory levels, inbound purchase orders, and agreed lead times for product deliveries, and generates purchase recommendations to support inventory and service level metrics and targets.
Information Systems
Over the past five years, we have invested heavily in our technology infrastructure with the goal of improving our scalability, performance, reliability, business continuity, and data security. We utilize leading software solutions for key aspects of our information systems, including Epicor for our ERP system, which covers sales order fulfillment, inventory management, and financial reporting, and Salesforce.com as our customer relationship management system, which covers customer interaction and information and field sales enablement.
Our digital technology footprint consists of a suite of enterprise-grade platforms that enable us to provide a leading customer experience. These platforms include Salesforce Commerce Cloud as our e-commerce platform, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as the backbone for our connected grill technology, Salesforce B2B Commerce for online dealer commerce, as well as a host of other specialized software solutions for targeted purposes. In addition, we have modernized our system integrations, leveraging an event-bus and service-oriented architecture to help ensure accuracy, monitoring, and self-healing processes for data movement between our enterprise systems. Our ERP interfaces with the e-commerce platform, as well as the management systems utilized at our outsourced warehousing and distribution centers, allowing us to effectively manage our global network of manufacturers and distributors and our expanding customer base.
In early 2020, we finished migrating all of our core business applications from an on-premise hosting infrastructure to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This has helped us achieve secure, redundant, and highly available business-critical applications. All other applications employed at Traeger are either SaaS-based or hosted on the cloud via AWS to achieve flexibility and accessibility to support the distributed nature of our global business. We believe our planned systems infrastructure will be sufficient to support our expected growth for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our brand, technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. In particular, we believe the Traeger brand is significant to the success of our business. We protect our intellectual property, including our brand, through a combination of trademarks, patents, copyrights, contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure agreements. For example, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information. We protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and certain international jurisdictions. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our innovation and distinctive product design, performance, and brand name and reputation, contribute to our competitive position and success of our business.
The original patent for the wood pellet grill, which was filed by Joe Traeger in 1986, expired in 2006. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 491 trademark registrations and 248 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 49 issued U.S. patents and 23 U.S. patent applications pending. Our material U.S. patents for our current products generally expire between March 2026 and May 2039, and cover rights related to our WiFIRE technology, D2 Direct Drive, and Super Smoke, among others. We also had approximately 126 issued foreign patents and 76 foreign patent applications pending.
We have a proactive online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any online counterfeit offerings. In addition, we work to shut down counterfeit stand-alone sites through litigation and administrative procedures.
We aggressively pursue and defend our intellectual property rights to protect our brand, designs, and inventions. We have processes and procedures in place to identify, protect, and optimize our intellectual property assets on a global basis. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products, technologies and processes that we believe are innovative, and will prosecute those who infringe on these valuable assets.

Competition
We operate in the highly competitive outdoor cooking market. Numerous other companies offer a wide variety of products, including traditional gas, charcoal and electric grills, that compete with our grills, accessories and other products.
We compete with established, well-known, and legacy grill brands, including Weber and Pit Boss, among others, as well as numerous other brands and grill manufacturers that offer competing products. These competitors offer a broad array of grills at different price points, including traditional gas, charcoal and electric grill offerings, as well as a significant number of wood pellet grills. We also compete against other wood pellet grill brands, such as Dansons. Moreover, the outdoor cooking market is expanding to include alternatives beyond traditional grills, and we also compete against companies that manufacture griddles, such as Blackstone, and companies that manufacture pizza ovens, such as Ooni. We have experienced an increase in competitors and competing offerings of gas and charcoal grills, wood pellet grills and other outdoor cooking devices in recent years.
Competition in the outdoor cooking market is based on a number of factors, including product quality, performance, ease of use, durability, styling, brand image and recognition, safety, and price, as well as the perceived taste and satisfaction to be attained in using a particular grill or cooking methodology. Our competitors may be able to develop and market high-quality products that compete with our products, sell their products for lower prices, adapt to changes in customer needs and preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing, and sale of their products, or generate greater brand recognition than us, including on social media and other internet platforms. These competitors may have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products, global product distribution, larger and broader retailer bases (including online retailers), more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers and manufacturers, greater brand recognition, larger or more effective ambassador and endorsement relationships, greater financial strength, larger research and development teams, larger marketing budgets, and more distribution and other resources than we do.
We also compete with providers of wood pellets for use in grilling, including well-known brands like Weber, Kingsford and Dansons, among others, whose pellets may be used with our grills. These competitors offer a broad array of pellet types and flavors. Similar to our experience regarding competition for our wood pellet grills, we have experienced an increase in competitors and competing offerings of wood pellets in recent years.
In July 2021, we acquired Apption Labs and began selling the MEATER smart thermometer. We compete in this space with brands such as Weber, Thermoworks and ThermoPro, among others.
In November 2021, we entered the direct-to-consumer meal kit market with our Traeger Provisions product line. We compete with well-known brands like Blue Apron, Hello Fresh and Freshly, among others. We offer a limited selection of premium frozen meal kits, consisting of high-quality ingredients, supplies and easy-to-follow instructions for our customer to prepare a meal using our grills, while these competitors offer a large selection of meal kits at various price points that are prepared using various cooking methodologies.
Sustainability
We are committed to preventing adverse environmental impacts in our operations, supply chain and product lifecycles. To reinforce our commitment to our stakeholders, we launched sustainability initiatives across our organization to address our potential and actual environmental impacts. The wood pellet industry has received increased scrutiny from civil society groups and the media for environmental impacts associated with wood sourcing and pellet burning. To address these stakeholder concerns, we have committed to reducing the environmental impact of our wood pellet business. For example, our Sustainable Wood Sourcing Policy requires that all upstream harvesting activities be conducted legally and in alignment with sustainable forestry best practices.
Our position in the value chain enables us to source our wood fiber as pre- and post-industrial byproduct from the lumber and furniture industries. We are increasingly focused on sourcing wood fiber with sustainability chain-of-custody verification through the Forest Stewardship Council ("FSC").
Seasonality
We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our grills in the first and second quarters of the year as our retailers purchase inventory in advance of warmer weather, when demand for outdoor cooking products is the highest across our key markets. Higher sales also coincide with social events and national holidays, which occur during the same 
Table of Contents

timeframe. Although our products can be used year-round, unusually adverse weather conditions can negatively impact the timing of the sales of certain of our products, causing reduced sales and negatively impacting profitability when such conditions exist. Prolonged adverse weather conditions could significantly reduce our sales in one or more periods. These conditions may shift sales to subsequent reporting periods, cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis or decrease overall sales. Please see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our business may fluctuate as a result of seasonality and changes in weather conditions.”
Environmental Matters
Certain of our operations, properties and products are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including environmental protection, occupational health and safety and the release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions and wastewater discharges. These laws and regulations, among other matters, govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air, soil and water, and establish standards for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
The trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly stringent and broader requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and products, particularly with respect to our wood pellet production facilities, and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party. We may choose not to, or may be otherwise unable to, pass on any increased costs to our customers. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that the current level of regulation will continue in the future.
We are also subject to permitting, registration, and other government approval requirements under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits, registrations, and other government approvals from one or more governmental agencies in order to conduct our operations and sell our products. The requirements vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are conducted. As with all governmental processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit, registration, or approval will be granted, the time it will take for a permit, registration, or approval to be issued and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit, registration, or approval.
The following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations and our wood pellet production facilities in particular.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA"), and state and local laws and implementing regulations, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit emission limits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has the potential to delay opening of new facilities or significant expansion of existing facilities; moreover, complying with these permits, including satisfying testing requirements, can be costly and time-intensive. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may cause us to face fines, penalties or injunctive orders in connection with air pollutant emissions from our operations.
The CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air operating permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.

Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
Climate change continues to attract considerable attention globally. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order that, among other things, established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, or Working Group, which is called on to, among other things, develop methodologies for calculating the “social cost of carbon.” The social cost of carbon assigns a dollar value on a metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions and is used in rulemakings to determine the potential benefits of controlling releases of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The Working Group set interim estimates consistent with the estimates developed by the Obama administration, in February 2021, and was tasked with producing final recommendations no later than January 2022. The Working Group has not yet released its final recommendations. However, in February 2022, a federal judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction preventing federal agencies from using the social cost of carbon after finding that the metric's application had increased regulatory costs. The Biden administration has appealed the decision, and the outcome of the litigation is uncertain at this time. The Biden administration also issued an executive order in January 2021 focused on addressing climate change. As a result of these recent developments, our operations could be subject to a series of regulatory, litigation and financial risks associated with the production, transportation and sale of our products. The potential effects of GHG emission limits on our business are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, and the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase our costs of operating and could require us to make significant financial expenditures that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Climate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs or, in some instances, adversely impact demand for our products.”
Finally, scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as sea-level rise, increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, including forest fires. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended ("Clean Water Act"), as well as state laws and implementing regulations, restrict the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants must be performed in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the U.S. EPA or the implementing state agency. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Although our facilities are presently in compliance with these requirements, changes to the terms and conditions of our permits in future renewals or new or modified regulations could require us to incur additional capital or operating expenditures which may be material.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended ("ESA"), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or habitat could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on the availability or price of raw materials. In particular, such developments could have the effect of reducing forestry operations in areas where we procure our raw materials and, in turn, the availability of raw materials required for our operations and the production of our wood pellets.
Waste Handling
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect our operations by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. While most wasted generated by our operations are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, these wastes typically constitute "solid wastes" that are subject to less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that RCRA 
Table of Contents

could be amended or the EPA or state environmental agencies could adopt policies to subject such wastes to more stringent waste handling requirements. Any changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
Remediation of Hazardous Substances
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, and analogous state laws, generally impose strict and joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed "responsible parties" may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Our facilities are located on sites that have been used for manufacturing activities for an extended period of time, which increases the possibility of contamination being present. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations, including accidental spills or releases in the course of our operations or those of a third party. Although we are not presently aware of any material contamination on our properties or any material remediation liabilities, we cannot assure you that we will not be exposes to significant remediation obligations or liabilities in the future. Liability for any contamination under these laws could require us to make significant expenditures to investigate and remediate such contamination or attain and maintain compliance with such laws and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition.
Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. OSHA regulations impose various requirements, including with respect to training, policies and procedures and maintenance. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standards in the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. National Fire Protection Association standards for combustible dust require our facilities to incorporate pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to minimize regulated emissions. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable safety, health, air, solid waste and wastewater regulations; nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that serious accidents will not occur in the future.
