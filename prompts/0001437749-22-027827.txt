See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" for additional information regarding reportable segments.
 
Manufacturing, Sourcing, and Distribution
 
The vast majority of our products are manufactured or sewn in facilities that we own or lease and operate to support both the Delta Group and Salt Life Group. To a lesser extent, we also use third-party contractors and suppliers to supplement our requirements. Our vertically-integrated manufacturing operations include a textile facility and multiple sew and decoration facilities.
 
Our manufacturing operations begin with the purchase of yarn and other raw materials from third-party suppliers. We have operated with a supply agreement with Parkdale Mills, Inc. and Parkdale America, LLC (collectively "Parkdale") to supply our yarn requirements since 2005, with our existing agreement running through December 31, 2024. Under the supply agreement, we purchase all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations from Parkdale, excluding yarns that Parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints. The purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton, as reported by the New York Cotton Exchange, plus a fixed conversion cost. We set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from Parkdale. 
 
We manufacture fabrics in our leased textile facility located near San Pedro Sula, Honduras. We also purchase fabric sourced in Mexico for use in our Campeche, Mexico sew facility, purchase specialized fabrics that we currently do not have the capacity or capability to produce, and may purchase other fabrics when it is cost-effective to do so. In 2022 and 2021, we manufactured approximately 80% of fabrics used in our internally-produced garments. The manufacturing process continues at one of our six apparel manufacturing facilities where fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments. These owned or leased facilities are located domestically (two in North Carolina) and internationally (two in Honduras, one in El Salvador and one in Mexico). In 2022 and 2021, approximately 95% or more of our manufactured products were sewn in our owned or leased manufacturing facilities. The remaining products were sewn by third-party contractors located primarily in the Caribbean Basin. To supplement our internal manufacturing platform, we purchase products from third-party global suppliers. In 2022 and 2021, we sourced less than 10% of our total products from third parties.
     3 

  

Many of the garments we produce will be decorated using screen printing or digital printing technology, and will be retail-packaged, including ticketing, hang tags, and hangers.  These services can be performed domestically for quick-turn service or internationally in our facilities in El Salvador and Mexico. We offer digital fulfillment services, powered by DTG2Go, at eight domestic facilities, including five such facilities that are integrated with Delta Group distribution centers. These facilities support our strategy of establishing integrated fulfillment locations that combine our DTG2Go state-of-the-art digital platform with our Delta Activewear supply of fashion and core basic garments. Furthermore, these facilities create a seamless nationwide footprint allowing us to reach approximately 95% of all U.S. consumers with two-day shipping.
 
  We operate  eight distribution facilities strategically located throughout the United States that carry in-stock inventory for shipment to customers, with most shipments made via third-party carriers. To better serve customers, we allow products to be ordered by the piece, dozen, or full case quantity, and we aggressively leverage our strengths and efficiencies to meet the quick-turn needs of our customers. Because a significant portion of our business consists of at-once replenishment orders, we believe that backlog order levels do not provide a general indication of future sales. 
 
 See Item 2. Properties for more information about each of our primary manufacturing and distribution facilities. 


Sales & Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing functions consist of both employed and independent sales representatives and agencies located throughout the country. Our sales teams service specialty and resort shops; department, mid-tier and mass retailers; sporting goods stores; eRetailers and the U.S. military. Our brands leverage both in-house and outsourced marketing communication professionals to amplify their lifestyle statements.
 
The majority of our apparel products are produced based on forecasts to permit quick shipments to our customers; however, our custom programs are generally made only to order. During 2022, we shipped our products to approximately 7,300 customers, many of whom have numerous retail doors.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in 2022 or 2021, and our strategy is to not become dependent on any single customer. Revenues attributable to sales of our products in foreign countries represented less than 1% of consolidated net sales in both 2022 and 2021.
 
Trademarks and License Agreements
 
We own several well-recognized trademarks that are important to our business. Salt Life® is an authentic, aspirational lifestyle brand that embraces those who love the ocean and everything associated with living the "Salt Life". Soffe® has stood for quality and value in the athletic and activewear market for more than sixty years. Our other registered trademarks include Intensity Athletics®, Kudzu®, Pro Weight®, Magnum Weight®, and the Delta Design logo trademark. Our trademarks are valuable assets that differentiate the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. While our strategy is to own the intellectual property we use within our business, we are an official intellectual property licensee for branches of the United States military which is used within the Soffe brand. We believe these license agreements are important given the military heritage of Soffe.
Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance
 
We aim to disclose and communicate transparently any material risks that could affect our investors, and we strive to implement policies and practices that continuously improve the transparency and sustainability of our supply chain. The Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance (“ESG”) disclosures within this Annual Report and our definitive Proxy Statement align with the standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) for the Apparel, Accessories, and Footwear industry and with regulations and guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The indicators in the Annual Report and definitive Proxy Statement have been carefully selected to show the most relevant aspects of our performance in the areas of environmental impact, health and safety, responsible raw material sourcing, safe chemical management, and responsible corporate governance.
Conserving the Environment
 
We believe that efficiently and sustainably managing natural resources is a smart business practice and a responsible decision for the planet. By effectively and safely managing the materials used to manufacture our apparel products, we also protect the health and safety of our customers and employees. Our commitment to environmental sustainability includes compliance with safe chemistry practices and implementing technology and processes that reduce energy and water consumption, reuse and effectively treat wastewater, and reduce and recycle waste. We are committed to full compliance with local, regional, and national environmental laws and regulations.

Reducing our Environmental Impact
 
Environmental problems such as climate change and resource depletion are escalating worldwide. Therefore, understanding and managing greenhouse gas emissions is important to effectively mitigate our impact to the environment. We are committed to monitoring our greenhouse gas emissions and adopting innovative technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our facilities and reduce our overall energy intensity, which is measured as primary energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per unit of gross domestic product.
 
The focus on reducing our overall energy intensity is driven by our goal to establish an energy efficient operation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will contribute to lowering our operating costs as well as reducing our carbon footprint. The operations at our Ceiba Textiles facility account for a significant portion of the fuel and electricity used in our manufacturing network and, as such, are our largest contributors of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In May 2022 Ceiba Textiles began receiving 100 percent clean, renewable energy from a 14.7-megawatt solar power array installed by the industrial park in which the facility is located. Not only is solar energy sustainable, it does not emit greenhouse gases, air, or water pollution when producing electricity, contributing to our goal to establish an energy efficient operation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 
When comparing 2022 to our 2018 baseline year, we have reduced our total greenhouse gas emissions by 3.5 percent and reduced our emissions intensity by 12 percent in 2022. These reductions avoid the equivalent of 1,637 metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is comparable to the energy used by approximately 206 homes for one year or the carbon sequestered by 1,937 acres of U.S. forests in one year.
 
In recent years we implemented several energy efficiency projects such as installing a heat exchanger at our Ceiba Textiles facility in Honduras that plays an essential role in reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing processes by recovering and reusing energy. We also continue to replace compact florescent light bulbs with LED lighting, which is known to emit less heat and use less energy than conventional bulbs, decrease the temperature on factory floors, and thus potentially raise productivity, particularly on hot days. In the sewing area, we improved the performance of our sewing machines by installing new motors that use significantly less energy due to advanced technology. In the knitting operations area, we modified the cooling system to turn off automatically when the outside temperature and humidity reaches the optimum environment inside.
 
In February 2022, we removed 27 older model circular knitting machines and installed 18 large capacity knitting machines. Each new machine is much more energy efficient in addition to being more productive; with each new machine capable of knitting one and one-half times more greige fabric in less time than one of the older knitting machines. The new knitting machines were directly responsible for reducing our electricity usage by approximately 393,000 kilowatt hours in 2022. Additional energy saving initiatives at Ceiba Textiles included the purchase of a new steam textile dryer that replaced two existing thermal oil dryers. The steam dryer is capable of drying 66 percent more pounds of fabric per week than the thermal dryers and uses 25 percent less energy. Over a four-month service period in 2022, the new steam dryer was responsible for reducing our electricity usage by approximately 250,000 kilowatt hours and we anticipate its energy savings to double next year. Together, these two energy-saving initiatives reduced our total electricity usage by 641,875 kilowatt hours and avoided 455 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is comparable to the carbon sequestered by 538 acres of forest in one full year. In addition, compared to our 2018 baseline year, we produced 9.7 percent more finished fabric in 2022 while using 7.5 percent less fuel and 8.6 percent less electricity. Overall, this has improved our fuel intensity by approximately 16 percent and electricity intensity by approximately 17 percent compared to the 2018 baseline year.
 
Managing Water
 
Water is one of the world’s most precious and vital resources. Access to water is essential to Delta Apparel’s manufacturing operations, and we are committed to managing our water use in an efficient and responsible manner. Treating textile wastewater is necessary not only to protect the local ecosystems, but also to make the recycled water available to reuse in manufacturing processes or irrigation. To properly treat problematic substances before the water is discharged, our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities, as well as our third-party fabric suppliers, comply with wastewater discharge requirements through currently active licenses and permits issued by local governments. In each of the last five years, none of these wastewater treatment facilities have received a compliance citation or violation.
 
During manufacturing the most significant amount of water consumption occurs during the fabric washing, dyeing, and rinsing processes. To reduce our water consumption at Ceiba Textiles, we implemented a system in 2018 that reuses the leftover dye water for use in future batches of similar-colored fabric. This system saves approximately 4 million gallons or 15,000 cubic meters of water per year while maintaining the quality of our dyed fabrics. We also improved our dye formulas to further reduce water consumption and reduce the amount of contaminates remaining in the wastewater. Compared to our 2018 baseline, these initiatives reduced our water intensity by 9.1 percent in 2021 and 7.3 percent in 2022.
 
Wastewater from Ceiba Textiles is transferred to the Green Valley water treatment facility, which operates on an environmental license issued by the Honduras Ministry of Energy, Natural Resources, Environment, and Mines. Over 87 percent of our 2022 water consumption at Ceiba Textiles was recycled. The Green Valley wastewater treatment facility uses the industry standard primary, secondary, and tertiary water treatment methods based on the types of effluents being discharged as well as regulatory and environmental standards. Treatment procedures are also in place to neutralize and remove additional substances that may potentially be harmful, but are not necessarily regulated. The following information describes the primary, secondary, and tertiary water treatment methods.
     5 

  


● | Primary – Primary treatment methods include screening, sedimentation, homogenization, pH neutralization, and mechanical and chemical flocculation, which is a chemical added to the water that binds suspended solids into heavier particles that are easier to remove. Nano and cross-flow nano filtration techniques are also used to reduce the vast majority of sodium chloride and dyes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secondary – Secondary treatment is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the wastewater by using a combination of physical and aerobic biological processes. Secondary treatment methods include various types of filtration along with an activated sludge process, which stabilizes and converts potentially toxic contaminates into less harmful forms such as carbon dioxide and water, which are safe for the environment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tertiary – Tertiary treatment is the final cleaning process that purifies wastewater before it is reused, recycled, or discharged into the environment. Treatment methods include a combination of physical and chemical techniques to decontaminate and purify the water.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing Waste
 
Our waste management strategy is to reduce, reuse, and recycle, which increases the likelihood that the waste materials we generate during the manufacturing process never reach landfills, lakes, rivers, streams, or municipal water systems. We are committed to full compliance with local, regional, and national environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate as it relates to responsible recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
 
Pre-consumer textile waste is created during the cutting and sewing processes and includes small pieces of fabric trimmed away and other fabric scraps. We have modified sewing patterns to significantly reduce fabric waste during cutting. We also invested in sewing machines capable of folding excess fabric inside the sleeve and bottom hems to eliminate trimming. This initiative not only reduces textile waste but also lowers fabric production needs, which saves water, electricity, and fuel. 
 
We have multiple reuse and recycle programs that help limit the waste that would otherwise be disposed in landfills:
 

● | We partner with several companies that collect our fabric waste and sell it to manufacturers in the automotive industry, among others, that can mix the fabric with other materials to create alternate applications for the fabric, such as for automotive seats and windshield wipers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our offshore screen-printing facilities recycle colors of ink that remain at the end of a production project for use in future production. In one year, this recycling program can recover as much as 75 percent of the residual plastisol ink and 50 percent of the residual water-based ink that otherwise would have been discarded.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All of our manufacturing, sewing, and distribution facilities participate in cardboard recycling programs. Each facility flattens and places all cardboard in an outside container for recycling companies to then collect on a regular schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Safe Chemistry
 
Textile operations use various chemicals, cleaners, dyes, and inks throughout the manufacturing, finishing, and decorating processes. We strive to use non-hazardous, bioeliminable ingredients in our apparel products and throughout our manufacturing processes to protect the safety of our customers and employees as well as reduce negative impacts on the environment. For example, our DTG2Go digital printing facilities use water-based biodegradable inks that are 100 percent non-hazardous and adhere to the strictest human health and environmental standards.
 
We have a robust, hazard-based chemicals management system throughout our manufacturing processes. Our commitment to safe chemistry begins in the design and development stage of our products, which are conceived from the latest fashion trends and are fully compliant with statutory, industry, and customer-specific safety requirements. We are proud that the chemicals we use comply with the restricted substance list (“RSL”) published by the American Apparel & Footwear Association (“AAFA”). AAFA is the industry’s leading resource for maintaining and publishing banned and restricted substances lists for finished apparel products around the world. We continuously monitor our RSL, which includes additional substances that may be harmful, but are not necessarily regulated. We also control against the procurement of restricted substances through our purchase approval processes and arrangements with dye and chemical vendors.
 
The dyes and chemicals used in our manufacturing facilities are tested annually by a third-party laboratory that uses a scoring system to determine the level of compliance. Since 2017 we have maintained a “Green” status, which is the highest level of compliance. Annual tests are also conducted by a third-party laboratory to ensure our compliance with The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“CPSIA”) of 2008 and The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65 of California State Law”), in addition to adherence to any customer-supplied RSL. Our manufacturing employees are provided training on compliance with our RSL as well as training on how to safely handle potentially hazardous substances throughout the manufacturing process.
     6 

  

It is also important to us that all our significant third-party yarn and fabric suppliers share our high compliance standards and operate in a legal and responsible manner. We require these suppliers to provide, at least annually, certification or self-declaration documents that demonstrate compliance with industry standard parameters for safe chemistry. We take immediate corrective actions in instances where non-compliance may be identified.
 
Responsible Sourcing
 
As a vertically-integrated apparel company, we believe it is important to have a high degree of oversight into all aspects of sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution. To that end, the lifecycle of a Delta Apparel garment begins with high quality, sustainable cotton, which is the primary ingredient for the majority of apparel products across our brand portfolio. Over 90 percent of our garments are created with U.S. cotton, which is known for both the quality of its fibers as well as the sustainability practices of the cotton farmers who harvest it. Cotton is not considered a water-intensive crop and more than 60 percent of the cotton grown in the U.S. is produced without irrigation. Cotton is also highly tolerant of soil and water salinity levels, so it can be grown with water and soil resources unsuitable for most other crops. We do not source cotton from regions that regularly experience water stress, and we do not source conflict minerals in the production of our products.
 
Delta Apparel is a member of the Cotton LEADS program, which is committed to sustainable and traceable cotton production. This partnership enables us to broaden our support of the cotton farmers who supply our Company with high-quality cotton, allowing us to continue transforming sustainably-sourced cotton into high quality, responsible apparel products for our customers. We serve as a supply chain partner for many customers who expect high quality raw materials and require the ability to trace those raw materials back to the source. With cotton traceability, we are now able to trace the fiber used in our garments all the way back to harvest.
 
The vast majority of the yarn we use in our textile operations is sourced from Parkdale Mills, whose products are independently certified to Standard 100 established by the International Oeko-Tex Association ("OEKO-TEX"), which is one of our industry's most well-known and trusted certifications for product safety. In addition, our significant suppliers of external fabric are certified to Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX.
 
Monitoring Progress
 
We use the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index to measure the environmental impact of all our offshore manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our key external fabric suppliers. The Higg Index tool provides transparency of our efforts to reduce our environmental impact, and it identifies areas for continued improvement. Our Ceiba Textiles facility has been using this tool for several years, and our 2021 self-assessment resulted in a total score in the upper quartile as compared to our industry competitors. Our most recent self-assessment was completed in April 2022 and the results will be available in April 2023. We retain the services of an external consultant to verify our assessments for a sample of facilities and to provide guidance for any areas of improvement.
Social Responsibility and Human Capital Management
 
Our employees are our most important and valuable asset. Our diverse and talented workforce helps drive our culture of high performance, close teamwork, and deep caring for each other across geographies and functions. We have an impact on the lives of over 8,600 employees across the globe as well as their families and communities. We support the livelihoods of our people through competitive wages and benefits, providing them with a safe and healthy workspace, supporting the communities in which they live, and, most importantly, treating all employees with dignity and respect.
Our People
 
The table below provides an overview of the approximate number of our employees by geographic location as well as the tenure of that employee base as of September 2022:

 | | | Tenure | 
--------------+---------------------+-----------------+--------------+-----------------
Country | Number of Employees | 5 Years or Less | 6 - 10 Years | 10 Years or More
El Salvador | 3,245 | 62% | 20% | 19% 
Honduras | 3,229 | 53% | 27% | 21% 
Mexico | 986 | 59% | 15% | 27% 
United States | 1,163 | 74% | 9% | 18% 
Total | 8,623 | 60% | 20% | 20% 

 
    7 

  

Our employee base fluctuates based on seasonal labor requirements within our distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as based on production levels within our manufacturing facilities.  These personnel changes generally trend with the overall demand for our products and services.
 
Approximately 80 percent of the employees at two of our facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, are party to multi-year collective bargaining agreements. We have historically conducted our operations without significant labor disruptions and believe that our relations with our employees are positive.
 
The table below provides an overview of the approximate percentage of our employees by gender and region as of September 2022:
 

Region | Male | Female
--------------+------+-------
Offshore | 49% | 51% 
United States | 35% | 65% 
Total | 47% | 53% 

Diversity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to fostering an inclusive culture where every employee is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender, age, race, abilities, sexual orientation, or other legally protected characteristic. We believe that our employees’ contributions are richer because of their diverse backgrounds and experiences, which strengthens the collaboration of our cross-functional, global teams and leads to improved performance.
Wages and Benefits
 
Investing in our people is critical for their personal and professional success, and we believe this investment enhances engagement and performance levels. Our compensation philosophy is to provide a fair living wage that is also scalable to the performance of the business. We provide our employees with at least the legal minimum wage or the prevailing industry wage in the countries where we operate, whichever is higher, complying with all legal requirements. We also provide fringe benefits, some of which are required by law, contract, or as per established collective bargaining agreements, while others are more favorable than required.
 
In recognition of the importance of raising the standard of living in certain communities in which we operate, we provide additional benefits, such as free onsite medical care from fully licensed physicians and nurses that encompass clinics and wellness programs. In these locations, we also provide subsidized meal assistance as well as free transportation to and from our facilities.
 
We invest in the professional development of our employees through various training programs. In 2022, we provided more than 230,400 hours of professional development and safety training for our employees, which is a 6 percent increase from the previous year.
 
Health and Safety
 
Our responsibility is to provide our employees with a safe and healthy work environment that meets or exceeds the applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. All our manufacturing facilities in El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico are Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”) certified. We are a Category C affiliate with the Fair Labor Association (“FLA”), an organization that supports human rights compliance monitoring for our plants and our third-party contractors.
 
Because textile manufacturing can contain various hazards and risks to workers, we have proactive programs in place to promote workplace safety, personal health, and employee wellness. Our culture promotes and rewards safety-first in all aspects of manufacturing, materials handling, and distribution of our apparel products. Safety training and awareness is embedded in employee orientation and onboarding, job performance and evaluation, and ongoing training based on a set safety training calendar by topic. We standardize, document, and improve our manufacturing and distribution safety procedures that require activities to be performed in the safest manner possible.
 
We are proud that our safety records are consistently better than OSHA’s benchmarks for the apparel manufacturing sector. For example, Delta Apparel’s 2022 incident rate for total recordable cases dropped to 0.19 percent compared to the apparel industry average incident rate of 1.7 percent.
 
Our production and distribution processes incorporate ergonomic material handling equipment to reduce physical risks, protect employee health, and optimize productivity. In our cut and sew facilities, we use ergonomically-friendly chairs and floor mats in addition to facilitating frequent group stretching and movement exercises. In several of our manufacturing and distribution facilities we provide lightweight slip sheet material handling equipment, which has the dual benefit of reducing manual labor and potential back strain on employees.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented a comprehensive series of protocols and safety measures across all our facilities to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors. We also created our own COVID-19 safety videos to promote healthy behaviors at home and in the workplace. Today, these COVID-19 safety measures are still in place at our offshore facilities, including maintaining plexiglass partitions to separate cafeteria seating areas and requiring all employees to observe safe distancing. We also continue to provide all employees with personal protective equipment, sanitizing products, and COVID-19 informational materials.
 
Monitoring
 
We conduct annual audits of all our internal manufacturing facilities as well as our significant third-party fabric suppliers to evaluate compliance with the FLA Workplace Code of Conduct. These audits cover labor topics, such as forced or child labor, compensation policies, and nondiscrimination, as well as environmental health and safety topics, such as fire safety, processes for safe chemistry, and environmental permits. These audits are important in identifying and preventing human rights and environmental health and safety violations.
 
The annual audits are conducted by Delta Apparel employees in our human resources or compliance departments, and they follow predefined audit programs and checklists that involve a mix of in-person site visits and walkthroughs of the facility, observations of processes, interviews with employees, and inspection of records and applicable permits. The audit results are documented with supporting photographs for any non-conformance findings. The internal auditors then report the findings to management, including the recommended corrective actions, and the date by which the corrective actions must be complete. The audits performed in 2022 resulted in no priority non-conformance findings, which are defined as severe violations of code of conduct in the areas of labor or environmental health and safety. For minor violations identified, we put corrective action plans in place to remediate the findings.
 
Community Outreach
 
Delta Apparel is committed to giving back to the communities where our employees live and work through volunteer service and community outreach. In 2022, our employees were involved in programs to promote environmental responsibility and improve the way of life for nearby communities. For example, Salt Life sponsored a number of national organizations, in addition to offering a variety of t-shirts for which donations were collected for various relief efforts. In addition, our US employees were directly involved with the community through both the donation of merchandise to fundraisers and sponsorship of individual volunteer efforts with nearby organizations. Additionally, our offshore employees in Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador were involved in numerous activities throughout the year including the following:

● | Our facilities in Mexico and Honduras continue to support COVID-19 campaigns in local communities by donating personal protection items such as sanitizing gel and face masks. Schools in Mexico that received donations were the 21 de Agosto Primary School in the town of Villa Madero, which is south of Seybaplaya, Campeche, and the Lazaro Cardenas Primary School in Seybaplaya where some of our employees’ children attend. Our Mexico facilities employ 210 people who live in these communities. In Honduras, donations of items such as bleach, sanitizing gel, alcohol, and face masks were made to the San Raphael Orphanage located in Villanueva, Cortes, and Dos Caminos Health Care Center located in Dos Caminos, Cortes. The Delta Honduras and Delta Cortes facilities employ 203 people who live in Dos Caminos.

● | For the second year, Mexico employees joined with the “Together We Will Win” civil association and the Una Caricia Humana, IAP organization to collect and donate thousands of plastic bottle caps that are sold to companies that grind and reuse the plastic to make new products. The proceeds from the sale of the caps are used to help cover the cost of comprehensive treatment for children with cancer. Una Caricia Humana provides free support to families of children with cancer such as food, lodging, medicines, treatment supplies, and transportation. 
● | For the second year, Delta Campeche employees participated in the Campeche Turtle Project to help save the critically endangered Hawksbill sea turtle by cleaning the plastic waste from beaches in Seybaplaya where the turtles come to lay their eggs for six months per year. On average, a sea turtle lays around 100 eggs; however, only 1 percent of the hatchlings actually makes its way out into the ocean and survives, making it critical to remove any obstacles that would prevent the hatchling from reaching the water. The beach cleanup resulted in one full trash bag for approximately every five yards of beach. 
● | Delta Cortes employees installed trash cans and environmental signs, and cleaned litter in an area of the Mico Quemado mountain range, which is an ecological reserve located in the department of Yoro. More than 280 square kilometers of this mountain chain are protected by the Central Government of Honduras due to its ecological importance to surrounding communities. Not only are the forests and valleys filled with rare plants and exotic animals, this area contains rivers and natural springs that are the primary water source for over 450,000 people in the cities of Santa Rita and El Negrito. 
● | Employees at Ceiba Textiles donated a gas-powered trimmer to the Quimistán Municipal Environmental Unit to support the maintenance of the area reforested as a result of the annual “United for a Greener Honduras” campaign in which Ceiba Textiles employees previously participated. Reforestation in this area of western Honduras was a critical factor in increasing the region’s water retention capacity as it reduced the impact to nearby communities when rivers would overflow during the rain and hurricane seasons. 
● | In the town of Santiago Nonualco in the department of La Paz, Textiles La Paz employees painted the entrance of the Caserio Ojo de Agua school and installed four fans in two classrooms. Out of the approximately 270 children who attend this school, 50 of those are the children of employees at the Textiles La Paz facility.

Competition
 
As a vertically-integrated apparel company, we have numerous competitors in both domestic and international markets, many of which are larger and have more brand recognition and greater marketing budgets. Some of these competitors may benefit from lower production costs that can result from greater operational scale, a differing supply chain footprint, or trade-related agreements and other macroeconomic factors that may enable them to compete more effectively.
 
Competition in our Delta Group segment is generally based upon price, service, delivery time, and quality, with the relative importance of each factor dependent upon the needs of the particular customer and the specific product offering. Our Delta Direct products generally are highly price competitive, and competitor actions can greatly influence pricing and demand for our products. While price is still important in our Global Brands and Retail Direct channels, quality and service are generally more important factors for customer choice. Our ability to consistently service the needs of our Global Brand and Retail Direct customers greatly impacts future business in these channels. We believe our U.S. market-adjacent manufacturing platform enables us to compete with our competitors by providing an outlet for customers to diversify their sourcing footprints and reduce time to market. Furthermore, as an integrated entity with design, manufacturing, sourcing, and marketing capabilities, we believe the interdependencies within our portfolio provide cost, quality, and speed to market advantages that enable us to be more competitive.
 
We believe that competition within our Salt Life Group segment is based primarily upon brand recognition, design, and consumer preference. We focus on sustaining the strong reputation of our lifestyle brands by adapting our product offerings to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences.  We aim to keep our merchandise offerings fresh with unique artwork and new designs and support the integrated lifestyle statement of our products through effective consumer marketing. We believe that our favorable competitive position stems from strong consumer recognition and brand loyalty, the high quality of our products, and our flexibility and process control, which drive product consistency. We believe that our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, design, marketing, product development, manufacturing, technology and distribution will, in large part, determine our future success.
 
Seasonality
 
Although our various product lines are sold on a year-round basis, the demand for specific products or styles reflects some seasonality. By diversifying our product lines and go-to-market strategies over the years, we have reduced the overall seasonality of our business. Consumer demand for apparel is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Therefore, the distribution of sales by quarter in 2022 may not be indicative of the distribution in future years.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, storm water flows, air emissions and solid waste disposal. The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations.
 
The environmental and other regulations applicable to our business are becoming increasingly stringent, and we incur capital and other expenditures annually to achieve compliance with these environmental standards and regulations. We currently do not expect that the amount of expenditures required to comply with these environmental standards or other regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, while we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and other regulatory requirements, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
