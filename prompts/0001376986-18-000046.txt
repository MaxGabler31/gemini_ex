ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Corporation
Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S.") that was created in 1933 by federal legislation in response to a proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  TVA was created to, among other things, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, reduce the damage from destructive flood waters within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, further the economic development of TVA’s service area in the southeastern United States, and sell the electricity generated at the facilities TVA operates. Today, TVA operates the nation’s largest public power system and supplies power to a population of nearly 10 million people.
TVA manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity.  Consistent with these primary purposes, TVA also manages the river system to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, natural resource protection, and economic development.  TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system.  In addition, the TVA Board of Directors (the "TVA Board") has established two councils — the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council ("RERC") — to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities.
Initially, all TVA operations were funded by federal appropriations.  Direct appropriations for the TVA power program ended in 1959, and appropriations for TVA’s stewardship, economic development, and multipurpose activities ended in 1999.  Since 1999, TVA has funded all of its operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity and power system financings. TVA’s power system financings consist primarily of the sale of debt securities and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements.  As a wholly-owned government corporation, TVA is not authorized to issue equity securities.

Service Area
TVA's service area, the area in which it sells power, is defined by the TVA Act. TVA supplies power in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Kentucky and in portions of northern Georgia, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Under the TVA Act, subject to certain minor exceptions, TVA may not, without the enactment of authorizing federal legislation, enter into contracts that would have the effect of making it, or the wholesale customers that distribute TVA power ("local power company customers" or "LPCs"), a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its LPCs were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957.  This provision is referred to as the “fence” because it bounds TVA’s sales activities, essentially limiting TVA to power sales within a defined service area.
Note
See Power Supply and Load Management Resources.
In addition, the Federal Power Act ("FPA") includes a provision that helps protect TVA’s ability to sell power within its service area.  This provision, called the "anti-cherrypicking" provision, prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines to others to deliver power to customers within TVA’s defined service area.  As a result, the anti-cherrypicking provision reduces TVA’s exposure to loss of its customers.

In 2018, the revenues generated from TVA’s electricity sales were $11.1 billion and accounted for virtually all of TVA’s revenues. TVA’s revenues by state for each of the last three years are detailed in the table below.

See Note 1 — Pre-Commercial Plant Operations.
Customers
TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power, selling power to LPCs that then resell power to their customers at retail rates.  TVA’s LPCs consist of (1) municipalities and other local government entities ("municipalities") and (2) customer-owned entities ("cooperatives").  These municipalities and cooperatives operate public power electric systems whose primary purpose is not to make a profit but to supply electricity to the general public or the cooperatives' members.  TVA also sells power directly to certain end-use customers, primarily large commercial and industrial loads and federal agencies with loads larger than 5,000 kilowatts ("kW"). Whether TVA or an LPC serves a new power customer is determined by the applicable TVA-LPC wholesale power contract. Each contract contains a formula that balances the size of the LPC and the amount of any TVA infrastructure investment to determine which party is entitled to serve the new customer.  In addition, power in excess of the needs of the TVA system may, where consistent with the provisions of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (the "TVA Act"), be sold under exchange power arrangements with other specific electric systems. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Revenues.

Local Power Companies
Revenues from LPCs accounted for approximately 91 percent of TVA’s total operating revenues in 2018.  At September 30, 2018, TVA had wholesale power contracts with 154 LPCs.  Each of these contracts requires the LPC to purchase from TVA all of the electric power required for service to the LPC’s customers. LPCs purchase power under contracts that range from five to 20 years to terminate.
See table below for LPC information by contract arrangement term.

TVA Local Power Company ContractsAt September 30, 2018
Contract Arrangements(1) | Number of LPCs | Sales to LPCsin 2018(in millions) | | Percentage of Total Operating Revenues in 2018
20-year termination notice | 3 | | $ | 133 | | 1.2 | %
15-year termination notice | 11 | | 498 | | 4.5 | % 
12-year termination notice | 1 | | 26 | | 0.2 | %

5-year termination notice | 87 | | 6,049 | | 53.9 | % 
Total | 154 | | $ | 10,262 | | 91.4 | %

Note
(1)  Ordinarily, the LPCs and TVA have the same termination notice period; however, in contracts with five of the LPCs with five-year termination notices, TVA has a 10-year termination notice (which becomes a five-year termination notice if TVA loses its discretionary wholesale rate-setting authority). Two of the LPCs have five-year termination notices or a shorter period if any act of Congress, court decision, or regulatory change requires or permits that election.
TVA’s two largest LPCs — Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") — have contracts with a five-year and a 10-year termination notice period, respectively.  Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively, of TVA’s total operating revenues in 2018.
The power contracts between TVA and LPCs provide for the purchase of power by LPCs at the wholesale rates established by the TVA Board.  Under the TVA Act, the TVA Board is authorized to regulate LPCs to carry out the purposes of the TVA Act through contract terms and conditions as well as through rules and regulations. TVA regulates LPCs primarily through the provisions of TVA’s wholesale power contracts.  All of the power contracts between TVA and the LPCs require that power purchased from TVA be sold and distributed to the ultimate consumer without discrimination among consumers of the same class and prohibit direct or indirect discriminatory rates, rebates, or other special concessions.  In addition, there are a number of wholesale power contract provisions through which TVA seeks to ensure that the electric system revenues of the LPCs are used only for electric system purposes.  Furthermore, almost all of these contracts specify the resale rates and charges at which the LPC must resell TVA power to its customers.  These rates are revised from time to time, subject to TVA approval, to reflect changes in costs, including changes in the wholesale cost of power.  
TVA also regulates LPC policies for customer deposits, termination of service for non-payment, information to consumers, and billing through a service practice policy framework. TVA’s regulatory framework provides for consistent regulatory policy for ratepayers across the Tennessee Valley, while recognizing local considerations. The regulatory provisions in TVA’s wholesale power contracts are designed to carry out the objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective of providing for adequate supply of power at the lowest feasible rates. See Rates — Rate Methodology below.
Other Customers
Revenues from directly served industrial customers accounted for approximately six percent of TVA’s total operating revenues in 2018.  Contracts with these customers are subject to termination by the customer or TVA upon a minimum notice period that varies according to a number of factors, including the customer’s contract demand and the period of time service has been provided. TVA also serves seven federal customers, ‎including U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") facilities and military installations, which accounted for approximately one percent of TVA’s total operating revenues in 2018.
Other Revenue 
Other revenue consists primarily of wheeling and network transmission charges, sales of excess steam that is a by-product of power production, delivery point charges for interconnection points between TVA and the customer, and certain other minor items. Other revenue accounted for $158 million, or approximately one percent, of TVA’s total operating revenues in 2018. 
11


Rates
Rate Authority
The TVA Act gives the TVA Board sole responsibility for establishing the rates TVA charges for power. These rates are not subject to judicial review or to review or approval by any state or federal regulatory body. Under the TVA Act, TVA is required to charge rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for:

• | Operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system;


• | Payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents");


• | Debt service on outstanding indebtedness;


• | Payments to the U.S. Treasury in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"); and


• | Such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness ("collectively, Bonds") in advance of their maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA’s power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. See Note 17 — Appropriation Investment. 

TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay $1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment in 2014; therefore, the repayment of this amount is no longer a component of rate setting.
Rate Methodology
TVA uses a wholesale rate structure comprised of a base rate and a fuel rate that is automatically determined each month by the operation of the fuel cost adjustment formula. In setting the base rates, TVA uses a debt-service coverage ("DSC") methodology to derive annual revenue requirements in a manner similar to that used by other public power entities that also use the DSC rate methodology. Under the DSC methodology, rates are calculated so that an entity will be able to cover its operating costs and to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on debt. This ratemaking approach is particularly suitable for use by entities financed primarily, if not entirely, by debt, such as TVA, and helps ensure that TVA produces gross revenues sufficient to fund requirements specified in the TVA Act listed under Rate Authority above.
TVA recovers fuel costs and tax equivalents payments associated with fuel cost adjustments through a monthly rate adjustment reflecting the costs paid by TVA for fuel. Beginning on October 1, 2018, fuel costs are allocated to three groups of customers: Standard Service (residential and small commercial customers), Large Manufacturing customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW, and Large General Service customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW. Fuel costs are allocated to these three classes of customers in relation to their average hourly loads and TVA's hourly incremental dispatch costs. Total monthly fuel costs include costs for natural gas, fuel oil, coal, purchased power, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities as well as realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities.
Since the fall of 2013, TVA, LPCs, and directly served industries have worked collaboratively to develop changes to TVA's rates that focus on TVA’s long-term pricing efforts. A comprehensive rate restructuring was implemented in October 2015 to improve pricing by better aligning rates with underlying cost drivers and to send improved pricing signals, while maintaining competitive industrial rates and keeping residential rates affordable.

Consistent with the pricing goals and changes implemented in the 2015 rate restructuring, TVA staff recommended, and the TVA Board approved, the proposed 2018 rate change on May 10, 2018. This change will reduce wholesale energy rates for Standard Service and introduce a Grid Access Charge ("GAC") at an offsetting rate to better recover fixed costs. Recognizing the need for flexibility, TVA presented all LPCs with the option to implement the wholesale changes in October 2018 or defer the implementation of the GAC until October 2019. The 2018 rate change better reflects the wholesale cost of energy and recognizes the value of the grid’s reliability and associated fixed costs. This modernized approach to pricing provides bill stability while maintaining reliability and fairness for all TVA's customers. 
Power Supply and Load Management Resources
General
TVA seeks to balance production capabilities with power supply requirements by promoting the conservation and efficient use of electricity and, when necessary, buying, building, or leasing assets or entering into power purchase agreements.  TVA also seeks to employ a diverse mix of energy generating sources and works toward obtaining greater amounts of its power supply from clean (low or zero carbon emitting) resources.
12


Power generating facilities operated by TVA at September 30, 2018, included 29 conventional hydroelectric sites, one pumped-storage hydroelectric site, six coal-fired sites, three nuclear sites, 17 natural gas and/or oil-fired sites, one diesel generator site, 14 solar energy sites, digester gas co-firing capacity at one coal-fired site, and biomass co-firing potential (located at coal-fired sites), although certain of these facilities were out of service as of September 30, 2018. See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties — Net Capability for a discussion of these facilities.  TVA also acquires power under power purchase agreements of varying durations, including short-term contracts of less than 24-hours in duration. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Expenses.
The following table shows TVA's generation and purchased power by generating source as a percentage of all
electric power generated and purchased (based on kilowatt hours ("kWh")) for the periods indicated:

Power Supply by Generating SourceFor the years ended September 30
Generation Resource | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Nuclear | 39% | 38% | 33% 
Natural gas and/or oil-fired | 20% | 16% | 16% 
Coal-fired | 19% | 25% | 29% 
Hydroelectric | 9% | 7% | 8% 
Purchased power (non-renewable) | 9% | 9% | 9% 
Purchased power (renewable) | 4% | 5% | 5% 

Note
TVA's non-hydro renewable resources from TVA facilities are less than one percent for all periods shown, and therefore are not represented on the table above. Purchased power (renewable) contains the majority of non-hydro renewable energy supply.
Nuclear
At September 30, 2018, TVA had three nuclear sites consisting of seven units in operation.  The units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry") are boiling water reactor units, and the units at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") and Watts Bar are pressurized water reactor units.  Operating information for each of these units is included in the table below.

Watts Bar Unit 1 | 987 | 95.5 | 2035 
Watts Bar Unit 2 | 1,135 | 78.3 | 2055 

Note
The summer net capability for Browns Ferry excludes the impact of the Extended Power Uprate project. The generating capability is expected to increase by an estimated 465 MW after completion of the project and sufficient run time to validate the new capacity.
Extended Power Uprate. On August 14, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") approved TVA’s request for a 465 MW extended power uprate ("EPU") project at Browns Ferry. TVA is implementing the EPU project during plant refueling outages. Physical work on Unit 3 was completed, and the unit was synced to the grid in April 2018. On July 13, 2018, Unit 3 reached the new EPU 100 percent power. Work is underway for Unit 1 and will commence in the spring of 2019 for Unit 2. Full EPU power is expected to be achieved following the noted outages and extensive power ascension testing for each unit. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Extended Power Uprate.
Other Nuclear Initiatives. TVA has submitted an Early Site Permit Application to the NRC to license small modular reactors ("SMRs") at TVA’s Clinch River Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Small Modular Reactors.
Other Nuclear Matters. Operating nuclear facilities subjects TVA to waste disposal, decommissioning, and insurance requirements, as well as litigation risks. See Fuel Supply — Nuclear Fuel below for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and low-
13


level radioactive waste ("radwaste"), Note 21 — Contingencies for a discussion of TVA's nuclear decommissioning liabilities and the related trust and nuclear insurance, and Note 21 — Legal Proceedings for a discussion of legal and administrative proceedings related to TVA's nuclear program, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference.
Coal-Fired
 As of September 30, 2018, TVA had six coal-fired plants consisting of 26 active units, accounting for 7,886 MW of summer net capability. Coal-fired units are either active or retired. TVA considers units to be in an active state when the unit is generating, available for service, or temporarily unavailable due to equipment failures, inspections, or repairs. All other coal-fired units are considered retired. 
Coal-fired plants have been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements over the last few decades, including those under the Clean Air Act ("CAA") and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Increasing regulatory costs have caused TVA to consider whether or not to make the required capital investments to continue operating these coal-fired facilities. In April 2011, TVA entered into two agreements (collectively, the "Environmental Agreements") to address a dispute under the CAA.  The first agreement is a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").  The second agreement is with Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups: the Sierra Club, National Parks Conservation Association, and Our Children’s Earth Foundation.  Under the Environmental Agreements, TVA agreed to retire 18 of its 59 coal-fired units by the end of 2017 and was generally absolved from any liability, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, under the New Source Review ("NSR") requirements of the CAA for maintenance, repair, and component replacement projects that were commenced at TVA's coal-fired units prior to the execution of the agreements. TVA also agreed to retire, repower, or install air pollution controls on 16 of the remaining coal-fired units. As of September 30, 2018, TVA has completed the requirements in the Environmental Agreements related to retiring coal-fired units or installing controls on such units. See Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired below.
TVA is moving toward a more balanced generation plan with greater reliance on lower-cost and cleaner energy generation technologies. Since September 30, 2010, TVA has reduced its summer net capability of coal-fired units by 6,682 MW. TVA’s long-range plans will continue to consider the costs and benefits of significant environmental investments at its remaining coal-fired plants. 
Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired
As of September 30, 2018, TVA’s natural gas and oil-fired fleet consisted of 101 combustion turbine power blocks (87 simple-cycle units and 14 combined-cycle power units).  Sixty of the simple-cycle units are currently capable of quick-start response allowing full generation capability in approximately 10 minutes. The economic dispatch of natural gas-fired plants depends on both the day-to-day price of natural gas and the price of other available intermediate resources such as coal-fired plants. TVA uses simple-cycle units to meet peaking or backup power needs. TVA also uses cogeneration at one simple-cycle unit. 
TVA’s strategy of portfolio diversification and air emissions reductions includes the addition of natural gas-fired plants to its generation fleet. In April 2018, TVA completed a natural gas-fired facility at the former Allen Fossil Plant ("Allen") with a generation capacity of approximately 1,106 MW. As of September 30, 2018, TVA had no natural gas-fired facilities under construction. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal and Natural Gas-Fired Units.

See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties, Note 9, Note 10, and Note 13 for a discussion of lease arrangements into which TVA has entered in connection with certain combustion turbine units. Because of TVA's strategy of portfolio diversification and reduction of air emissions, TVA may decide to make further strategic investments in natural gas-fired facilities in the future by purchase, construction, or lease.
Hydroelectric
Conventional Hydroelectric Dams. TVA maintains 29 conventional hydroelectric dams with 109 generating units throughout the Tennessee River system for the production of electricity.  As of September 30, 2018, these units accounted for 3,782 MW of summer net capability.  The amount of electricity that TVA is able to generate from its hydroelectric plants depends on a number of factors, including the amount of precipitation and runoff, initial water levels, generating unit availability, and the need for water for competing water management objectives.  When these factors are unfavorable, TVA must increase its reliance on higher cost generation plants and purchased power.  In addition, a portion of energy generated by nine U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE") dams on the Cumberland River system contributes to the TVA power system.  See Weather and Seasonality below and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Dam Safety and Remediation Initiatives.
Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant.  As of September 30, 2018, TVA has four units at Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant ("Raccoon Mountain") with a total net summer capability of 1,616 MW. These units are utilized to balance the transmission system as well as generate power. TVA uses electricity generated by its fleet during periods of low 
14


demand to operate pumps that fill the reservoir at Raccoon Mountain. Then, during periods of high or peak demand, the water is released and the pumps reverse to work as power generating turbines. 
Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2.  Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a unique reversible turbine/generator that acts as a pump and a turbine enhancing TVA’s ability to balance baseload generation.  Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a summer net capability of 86 MW.
Hydro Modernization Program. TVA is scheduled to complete the Hydro Modernization Program in 2019 with the completion of South Holston Unit 1 and Pickwick Landing Dam ("Pickwick") Unit 2. The Hydro Modernization program began in 1992 and focuses on units with potential to increase peaking capacity and improve reliability. As of September 30, 2018, modernization had been completed on 60 conventional hydroelectric units, including Pickwick Unit 3 in 2018. The modernization projects resulted in 444 MW of increased capacity from the conventional hydroelectric units, with an average efficiency gain of approximately five percent. In 2019, TVA will transition to a new program, the Hydro Major Maintenance Program, intended to focus on life extension and addressing reliability risks that will support the preservation of TVA’s hydro fleet capacity. Hydroelectric generation will continue to be an important part of TVA's energy mix.

Other Renewable Energy Resources

 TVA's renewable energy portfolio includes both TVA-owned assets and renewable energy purchases. TVA owns 14 solar sites with a total net summer capability of approximately 1 MW. Certain coal-fired units have the capability for digester gas and biomass co-firing, which is accounted for as coal-fired generation summer net capability. 
TVA tracks its renewable energy commitments and claims through the management of renewable energy certificates ("RECs"). The RECs, which each represent 1 MWh of renewable energy generation, are principally associated with wind, solar, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric. TVA also acquires RECs from renewable purchased power.
Diesel Generators
As of September 30, 2018, TVA had one diesel generator plant consisting of five units, and this facility accounted for 9
MW of summer net capability.
Distributed Energy Resources
Consumer desire for energy choice is, among other things, driving the expectation for flexible options in the electric industry. TVA and LPCs are working together to leverage the strengths of the Tennessee Valley public power model to provide distributed energy solutions that are economic, sustainable, and flexible. TVA will focus on the safety and reliability impacts of these resources as they are interconnected to the grid and will ensure that the pricing of electricity remains as low as feasible. Additional regulatory considerations and analysis may be required as the distributed energy resources ("DER") market, technologies, and programs evolve. TVA will work to develop pricing and regulatory structures with a deliberate and thoughtful analysis of each current and future program offering. This will require strong partnerships with LPCs to reinforce local control, provide customers choices, and provide end-use consumers the flexibility they desire. In May 2017, the TVA Board authorized up to $300 million to be spent over the next 10 years, subject to annual budget availability and necessary environmental reviews, to build an enhanced fiber network that will better connect its operational assets. Fiber is a vital part of TVA’s modern communication infrastructure. The new fiber optic lines will improve the reliability and resiliency of the generation and transmission system while enabling the system to better accommodate DER as they enter the market.
TVA has encouraged the development of solar, wind, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric generation systems across the Tennessee Valley through various current and former offerings. As of September 30, 2018, the combined participation for all such renewable solutions is approximately 450 MW of installed operating capacity with nearly 134 MW of additional approved capacity. Additionally, TVA contracts for approximately 1,215 MW of operating wind capacity from outside the Tennessee Valley via power purchase agreements.
New energy management systems and energy storage technologies present opportunities for more sophisticated and integrated operation of the entire grid. The advent of electric vehicles and small-scale renewable generation has hastened the development of battery technologies that have the potential to mitigate the intermittent supply issues associated with many renewable generation options. Implementation of these technologies in conjunction with two-way communication to the site creates the potential for more efficient usage of other DER on the grid.
Onsite energy management technologies and the proliferation of companies interested in providing services to support and aggregate the impacts of such systems provide another DER opportunity. Such systems can afford the consumer benefits through reduced consumption, increased comfort, detailed energy use data, and savings from time-sensitive rate structures. TVA and LPCs must consider the integration of the impacts from changes in energy usage patterns resulting from the operation of such systems.
Demand response systems that take advantage of the increasing sophistication in communication to homes, businesses, and distribution system assets also afford the opportunity for more granular control of system demand. 
15


Technologies can manage individual customer systems to shift usage from peak to off-peak periods and create significant reductions in the need for peak generation output. More sophisticated distribution control systems can also lower peak demand through control of excess voltage on the grid on either a dispatchable or continuous basis.
TVA is leading an initiative to determine the value of DER for its system. Initial efforts are focused on small-scale distributed (rooftop) solar, but the efforts are general enough to allow for other distributed options. These efforts are ongoing, led by a team that includes technical support from the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI"), to develop a methodology to identify site preferences on the distribution systems of the LPCs. This work, along with locational analysis already completed by TVA, will help in placing utility-scale solar in furtherance of the Integrated Resource Plan recommendations as well as distributed solar to meet the needs of LPCs. See Research and Development below. 
Purchased Power and Other Agreements
TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers through long-term and short-term power purchase agreements as well as through spot market purchases.  During 2018, TVA acquired approximately 11 percent of the power that it purchased on the spot market, approximately one percent through short-term power purchase agreements, and approximately 88 percent through the long-term power purchase agreements described below, including agreements for long-term renewable generation resources.
A portion of TVA’s capability provided by power purchase agreements is provided under contracts that expire between 2023 and 2038, and the most significant of these contracts are described in the table below.

Notes
(1) Power delivery is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2019.
(2) TVA’s contract with Southeastern Power Administration ("SEPA") is for 405 MW of capacity; however, at September 30, 2018, TVA’s capacity under the contract was 347 MW because of repairs being completed by the USACE.  TVA expects this period of reduced capacity to be in effect until July 2019.  

 Under federal law, TVA is required to purchase energy from qualifying facilities (cogenerators and small power producers) at TVA's avoided cost of either generating this energy itself or purchasing this energy from another source. TVA fulfills this requirement through the Dispersed Power Production Program. As of September 30, 2018, there were 36 generation sources, with a combined qualifying capacity of 259 MW, whose power TVA purchases under this program.
Fuel Supply
General
TVA’s consumption of various types of fuel depends largely on the demand for electricity by TVA’s customers, the availability of various generating units, and the availability and cost of fuel. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Expenses.
16


Nuclear Fuel
Current Fuel Supply. Converting uranium to nuclear fuel generally involves four stages: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas; the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into fuel assemblies.  For its forward four-year (2019-2022) requirements, TVA currently has 100 percent of its uranium mining and milling, conversion services, enrichment services, and fabrication services requirements either in inventory or under contract with various suppliers.  TVA anticipates being able to fill its needs beyond this period by normal contracting processes as market forecasts indicate that the fuel cycle components will be readily available. The net book value of TVA's nuclear fuel inventory was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 15 — Counterparty Risk.
TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements providing for surplus DOE highly enriched uranium (uranium that is too highly enriched for use in a nuclear power plant) to be blended with other uranium.  The enriched uranium that results from this blending process, which is called blended low-enriched uranium ("BLEU"), is fabricated into fuel that can be used in a nuclear power plant.  This blended nuclear fuel was first loaded in a Browns Ferry reactor in 2005 and the last reload of BLEU material is currently underway at Browns Ferry. BLEU fuel was loaded into Sequoyah Unit 2 three times but is not expected to be used in the Sequoyah reactors in the future. There is a potential to receive additional BLEU fuel beginning in 2020, and it would be used in future Browns Ferry reloads. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE participates in the savings generated by TVA's use of the BLEU. See Note 1 — Blended Low-Enriched Uranium Program for a more detailed discussion of the BLEU project.
TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements providing for the production, processing, and storage of low-enriched uranium that is to be made using surplus DOE highly enriched uranium and other uranium.  Low-enriched uranium can be fabricated into fuel for use in a nuclear power plant.  Production of the low-enriched uranium is expected to begin in spring or summer of 2019. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE will reimburse TVA for a portion of the costs of converting the highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium.
Low-Level Radioactive Waste. Radwaste results from certain materials and supplies used in the normal operation of nuclear electrical generation units. TVA sends shipments of radwaste to burial facilities in Clive, Utah and Andrews, Texas.  TVA is capable of storing some radwaste at its own facilities for an extended period of time, if necessary.
Spent Nuclear Fuel.  All three nuclear sites have dry cask storage facilities.  Sequoyah will need additional capacity by 2028.  Watts Bar will need additional capacity by 2041.  Browns Ferry will need additional storage capacity by the end of 2020.  A project is underway at Browns Ferry to build another independent spent fuel storage installation pad and is scheduled for completion by January 2020. To recover the cost of providing long-term, onsite storage for spent nuclear fuel, TVA filed a breach of contract suit against the U.S. in the Court of Federal Claims in 2001. As a result of this lawsuit and related agreements, TVA has collected approximately $273 million through 2018. 
Tritium-Related Services.  TVA and the DOE are engaged in a long-term interagency agreement under which TVA will, at the DOE’s request, irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods ("TPBARs") to assist the DOE in producing tritium for the Department of Defense ("DOD").  This agreement, which ends in 2035, requires the DOE to reimburse TVA for the costs that TVA incurs in connection with providing irradiation services and to pay TVA an irradiation services fee at a specified rate per TPBAR over the period when irradiation occurs.
 In general, TPBARs are irradiated for one operating cycle, which lasts about 18 months.  At the end of the cycle, TVA removes the irradiated rods and loads them into a shipping cask.  The DOE then ships them to its tritium-extraction facility.  TVA loads a fresh set of TPBARs into the reactor during each refueling outage.  Irradiating the TPBARs does not affect TVA’s ability to safely operate the reactors to produce electricity.
TVA has provided irradiation services using only Watts Bar Unit 1 since 2003. Although the interagency agreement provides for irradiation services to be performed at Watts Bar and Sequoyah, TVA expects the Watts Bar site to provide sufficient capacity to fulfill this agreement in the near term. The DOE notified TVA of future increased needs for tritium requiring the use of a second reactor. TVA submitted a license amendment to the NRC in December 2017 to authorize the irradiation of TPBARs in Watts Bar Unit 2. The NRC is expected to issue a decision by May 2019. 
Coal
Coal consumption at TVA’s coal-fired generating facilities during 2018 and 2017 was approximately 17 million tons and 21 million tons, respectively.  At September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, TVA had 30 days and 36 days of system-wide coal supply at full burn rate, respectively, with net book values of $164 million and $253 million, respectively. 
17


TVA utilizes both short-term and long-term coal contracts.  During 2018, long-term contracts made up 97 percent of coal purchases and short-term contracts accounted for the remaining three percent.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths, terms, and coal quality to meet its expected consumption and inventory requirements.  During 2018 and 2017, TVA purchased coal by basin as follows:
The following charts present the proportion of each delivery method TVA utilizes for its coal supply for the periods indicated:
Generally, total system coal inventories were at or below target levels for 2018 as inventory levels were adjusted for unit retirements and unit generation mix changes.
Natural Gas and Fuel Oil
During 2018, TVA purchased a significant amount of its natural gas requirements from a variety of suppliers under contracts with terms of up to three years and purchased substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market. The net book value of TVA’s natural gas inventory was $18 million and $15 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net book value of TVA’s fuel oil inventory was $84 million and $87 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At September 30, 2018, 80 of the combustion turbines that TVA operates were dual-fuel capable, and TVA has fuel oil stored on each of these sites as a backup to natural gas.
TVA purchases natural gas from multiple suppliers on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and term basis.  During 2018, daily, monthly, seasonal, and term contracts accounted for 35 percent, 11 percent, 16 percent and 38 percent of purchases, respectively.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet.  During 2018, TVA transported natural gas on eight separate pipelines, with approximately 33 percent being transported on a single pipeline. During 2018, TVA maintained a total of approximately 1,409,500 million British thermal unit(s) ("mmBtu") per day of firm transportation capacity on seven major pipelines, with approximately 31 percent of total firm transportation capacity being maintained on a single pipeline.
18


TVA utilizes natural gas storage services at seven facilities with a total capacity of 8.25 billion per cubic feet ("Bcf") of firm service and 2.30 Bcf of interruptible service to manage the daily balancing requirements of the eight pipelines used by TVA, with approximately 43 percent of the total storage capacity being maintained at a single facility. During 2018, storage levels were generally maintained at between 40 and 80 percent of the maximum contracted capacity at each facility. As TVA’s natural gas requirements grow, it is anticipated that additional storage capacity may need to be acquired to meet the needs of the generating assets as well as their operating requirements.  In 2019, TVA does not expect to add a significant amount of firm capacity to its storage portfolio.
Transmission
The TVA transmission system is one of the largest in North America.  TVA’s transmission system has 69 interconnections with 13 neighboring electric systems, and delivered nearly 163 billion kWh of electricity to TVA customers in 2018.  In carrying out its responsibility for transmission grid reliability in the TVA service area, TVA has operated with 99.999 percent reliability since 2000 in delivering electricity to customers. See Item 2, Properties — Transmission Properties.
Pursuant to its Transmission Service Guidelines, TVA offers transmission services to eligible customers to transmit wholesale power in a manner that is comparable to TVA's own use of the transmission system. TVA has also adopted and operates in accordance with its published Transmission Standards of Conduct and separates its transmission function from its power marketing function.
TVA is subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") and approved by FERC. These standards are designed to maintain the reliability of the bulk electric system, including TVA’s generation and transmission system, and include areas such as maintenance, training, operations, planning, modeling, critical infrastructure, physical and cyber security, vegetation management, and facility ratings. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations continue to become more complex and stringent for transmission systems. 
Additional transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability.  TVA invested $419 million between 2011 and 2018 to maintain reliability as a result of retired coal-fired units, and estimates future expenditures to be approximately $10 million for 2019 to 2020. Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. In May 2017, the TVA Board approved a $300 million multi-year, strategic fiber initiative that will expand TVA’s fiber capacity and improve the reliability and resiliency of the transmission system.  The network expansion is designed to help meet the power system’s growing need for bandwidth as well as accommodate the integration of new DER. 

The TVA Board approved $245 million for the construction of a new system operations center (“SOC”). The new secured facility is being built to accommodate a new energy management system and to adapt to new regulatory requirements.  The facility is expected to be constructed by 2021 and fully operational by 2023. 
Weather and Seasonality
Weather affects both the demand for and the market prices of electricity. TVA’s power system is generally a dual-peaking system in which the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which average temperatures in the five largest cities in TVA's service area vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Sales of Electricity.
Competition
TVA provides electricity in a service area that is largely free of competition from other electric power providers based on the provisions of the TVA Act. This service area is defined primarily by provisions of law and long-term contracts. The fence limits the region in which TVA or LPCs that distribute TVA power may provide power. The anti-cherrypicking provision limits the ability of others to use the TVA transmission system for the purpose of serving customers within TVA’s service area.  State service territory laws limit unregulated third parties' ability to sell electricity to consumers. All TVA wholesale power contracts are all requirements contracts. However, other utilities may use their own transmission lines to serve customers within TVA's service area, and third parties are able to avoid the restrictions on serving end-use customers by selling or leasing generating assets to a customer rather than selling electricity. These threats underscore the need for TVA to strategically price its products and services and design rates to be competitive.  There have also been some efforts in the past to erode the anti-cherrypicking provision, and the protection of the anti-cherrypicking provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future.  
TVA also faces competition in the form of emerging technologies.  Improvements in energy efficiency technologies, smart technologies, and energy storage technologies may reduce the demand for centrally provided power. The growing interest by customers in generating their own power through DER has the potential to lead to a reduction in the load served by TVA as well as cause TVA to re-evaluate how it operates the overall grid system to continue to provide highly reliable power at 
19


affordable rates.  See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Distributed Energy Resources.
Finally, TVA and other utility companies are facing an evolving marketplace of increased competition driven by customer choice and behavior. As technology develops, consumers' demands for access to diverse products and services may increase, creating opportunities for growth with new products and services resulting from emerging technologies.
Research and Development
Investments in TVA’s research portfolio are supported through partnership and collaboration with LPCs, EPRI and other research consortiums, the DOE and other federal agencies, national labs, peer utilities, universities, and industry vendors and participation in professional societies.
TVA makes annual investments in science and technological innovation to help meet future business and operational challenges. Each year, TVA’s annual research portfolio is updated based on a broad range of operational and industry drivers that help assess key technology gaps, performance issues, or other significant issues that should be addressed through research and development. Core research activities directly support optimization of TVA's generation and transmission assets, air and water quality, energy utilization, and distributed/clean energy integration. TVA has recently launched a research program focused on evaluating the potential to deploy grid-scale battery energy storage technology to optimize utilization of existing TVA generation assets and improve the resiliency of the transmission system. This research will guide future application of battery storage as part of the evolving bulk power system in the region.
In the area of energy utilization, TVA evaluates emerging energy efficiency and load management technologies for market and program readiness. TVA's efforts are directed towards demonstrating and validating the performance, reliability, and consumer acceptance of new efficiency technologies as well as the value of energy efficiency and load management technologies for the consumer, LPCs, and TVA.
TVA is also beginning the assessment of potential electrification programs that may improve resource utilization and reduce environmental impacts (especially in the transportation sector). This assessment includes a multi-stakeholder vision and roadmap effort aimed at identifying the path forward for electric vehicles in Tennessee. This approach provides for broad engagement from industry, government and utilities and could be applied in other states in the TVA service territory. In addition, TVA is continuing its evaluation of potential electric vehicle adoption strategies through coordination of activities with EPRI and industry stakeholders related to operational fleet requirements. The needs of LPCs to provide guidance on matters of plug-in electric vehicle grid integration and readiness for various transportation electrification technologies are also areas of focus.
Research in this area of electrification applications includes compatibility of charging stations to work efficiently with various types of electric vehicles, impact of charging stations on the power grid, refinement of power-system control processes to maximize energy efficiency, and development of smart charging strategies to maximize the potential of electricity to replace petroleum as the transportation fuel of choice.
TVA and its LPCs are engaged in several initiatives related to grid modernization, including research into technologies and applications with the potential to advance an intelligent transmission and distribution system. Smart meter technology has the potential to shift usage patterns away from peak demand times which could change costs significantly. Additionally, an intelligent transmission system would give TVA the ability to nearly instantaneously diagnose problems, make corrections, and engage transmission and generation resources quickly so that power would keep flowing. This could promote reduced emissions, lower energy costs, and add greater flexibility to accommodate the new consumer-generated sources under TVA’s renewable energy programs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Distributed Energy Resources.
Finally, TVA is evaluating smaller, clean power sources that can be aggregated to provide power necessary to meet regular demand. Research efforts into clean DER seek to understand the scope and impact of DER on operations and business economics and to develop strategies for adapting to the evolving electricity landscape in the Tennessee Valley. Of particular interest are investigations into the potential applications of battery storage and modeling existing and expected solar power deployments in the Tennessee Valley to evaluate the full extent of system impacts of those renewable resources. Initial economic analyses have been conducted to identify the value of DER (particularly photovoltaic solar generation) to both TVA and the LPC system. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Distributed Energy Resources.
Flood Control Activities
The Tennessee River watershed has one of the highest annual rainfall totals of any watershed in the U.S., averaging 51 inches per year. During 2018, approximately 60 inches of rain fell in the Tennessee Valley. TVA manages the Tennessee River system in an integrated manner, balancing hydroelectric generation with navigation, flood damage reduction, water quality and supply, and recreation. TVA spills or releases excess water through its dams in order to reduce flood damage to the Tennessee Valley. TVA typically spills only when all available hydroelectric generating turbines are operating at full capacity and additional water still needs to be moved downstream.
20


Environmental Stewardship Activities
TVA’s mission includes managing the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and federal lands along the shoreline to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, affordable and reliable electricity, and, consistent with these primary purposes, recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, and natural resource protection.  There are 49 dams that comprise TVA’s integrated reservoir system. Each dam may also have ancillary structures used to support or assist the main dam's function. The reservoir system provides approximately 800 miles of commercially navigable waterways and also provides significant flood reduction benefits both within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The reservoir system also provides a water supply for residential and industrial customers, as well as cooling water for TVA’s coal-fired plants, combined cycle plants, and nuclear power plants. TVA’s Environmental Policy provides objectives for an integrated approach related to providing cleaner, reliable, and low-cost energy, supporting sustainable economic growth, and engaging in proactive environmental stewardship in a balanced and ecologically sound manner. The Environmental Policy provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas, including water resource protection and improvements, sustainable land use, and natural resource management.
TVA serves the people of the TVA region through the integrated management of the Tennessee River system and public lands, which includes approximately 11,000 miles of shoreline, 650,000 surface acres of reservoir water, and 293,000 acres of reservoir lands.  TVA accomplishes this mission and supports the objectives of the TVA Environmental Policy through implementation of its natural resources stewardship strategy.  Within this strategy, TVA confirms a desire to remain agile, balance competing demands, and be a catalyst for collaboration in order to protect and enhance biological, cultural, and water resources as well as create and sustain destinations for recreation and opportunities for learning and research.  As part of the strategy, TVA will also assist water-based community development with technical support, land agreements, and permitting using planning, clear regulations, meaningful guidelines, and consistent enforcement. Additional guidance for carrying out many of TVA's essential stewardship responsibilities is provided in TVA's Natural Resource Plan ("NRP"). TVA is currently updating its Natural Resource Plan. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Natural Resource Plan.
Economic Development Activities
Economic development, along with energy production and environmental stewardship, is one of the primary statutory purposes of TVA. TVA works with its LPCs, regional, state, and local agencies, and communities to showcase the advantages available to businesses locating or expanding in TVA's service area. TVA's primary economic development goals are to recruit companies to locate in the Tennessee Valley, encourage expansion of existing business and industry that provide quality jobs, and assist communities in the Tennessee Valley with economic growth opportunities. TVA seeks to meet these goals through a combination of initiatives and partnerships designed to provide financial assistance, technical services, industry expertise, and site-selection assistance to new and existing businesses.
Economic development programs developed by TVA include those which focus on supporting all communities including rural and economically distressed communities across the Tennessee Valley by working in close partnership with other federal and state organizations. TVA also jointly offers incentive programs with participating LPCs. These programs offer competitive incentives to existing and potential power customers in certain business sectors that make multi-year commitments to invest in the Tennessee Valley. In addition to financial support for these programs, TVA offers resources to communities and economic developers in the areas of recruitment, leadership development, industrial product preparedness (sites and buildings), planning, and project assistance.
TVA's economic development efforts helped recruit or expand over 211 companies into the TVA service area during 2018. These companies announced capital investments of over $11.3 billion and the expected creation and/or retention of over 65,400 jobs.
Regulation
Congress
TVA exists pursuant to the TVA Act as enacted by Congress and carries on its operations in accordance with this legislation.  Congress can enact legislation expanding or reducing TVA’s activities, change TVA’s structure, and even eliminate TVA.  Congress can also enact legislation requiring the sale of some or all of the assets TVA operates or reduce the U.S.’s ownership in TVA.  To allow TVA to operate more flexibly than a traditional government agency, Congress exempted TVA from all or parts of certain general federal laws that govern other agencies, such as federal labor relations laws and the laws related to the hiring of federal employees, the procurement of supplies and services, and the acquisition of land.  Other federal laws enacted since the creation of TVA that are applicable to other agencies have been made applicable to TVA, including those related to paying employees overtime and protecting the environment, cultural resources, and civil rights.
21


Securities and Exchange Commission
Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires TVA to file with the SEC such periodic, current, and supplementary information, documents, and reports as would be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act if TVA were an issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  Section 37 of the Exchange Act exempts TVA from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer’s audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer.  Since TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the U.S., securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are “exempted securities” under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may be offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act.  In addition, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are “exempted securities” and “government securities” under the Exchange Act.  TVA is also exempt from Sections 14(a)-(d) and 14(f)-(h) of the Exchange Act (which address proxy solicitations) insofar as those sections relate to securities issued by TVA, and transactions in TVA securities are exempt from rules governing tender offers under Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act.  Also, since TVA securities are exempted securities under the Securities Act, TVA is exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 insofar as it relates to securities issued by TVA, and no independent trustee is required for these securities.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Under the FPA, TVA is not a “public utility,” a term which primarily refers to investor-owned utilities.  Therefore, TVA is not subject to the full jurisdiction that FERC exercises over public utilities under the FPA.  TVA is, however, an “electric utility” and a “transmitting utility” as defined in the FPA and, thus, is directly subject to certain aspects of FERC’s jurisdiction. Under the FPA, for example, TVA (1) must comply with certain standards designed to maintain transmission system reliability, (2) can be ordered to interconnect its transmission facilities with the electrical facilities of independent generators and of other electric utilities that meet certain requirements, (3) can be ordered to transmit wholesale power provided that the order (a) does not impair the reliability of the TVA or surrounding systems and (b) meets the applicable requirements concerning terms, conditions, and rates for service, as well as the anti-cherrypicking provision, (4) is subject to FERC review of the transmission rates and the terms and conditions of service that TVA provides, and (5) is prohibited from (a) reporting false information on the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity to a federal agency with intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled by the agency and (b) using manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of power or transmission services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction.
In addition, the FPA provides FERC with authority (1) to order refunds of excessive prices on short-term sales (transactions lasting 31 days or less) by all market participants, including TVA, in price gouging situations if such sales are through an independent system operator or regional transmission organization under a FERC-approved tariff, (2) to issue regulations requiring the reporting, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale power and transmission service by all market participants, including TVA, (3) to investigate electric industry practices, including TVA’s operations that are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction, and (4) to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation of the provisions of the FPA discussed in the prior paragraph that are applicable to TVA. Criminal penalties may also result from such violations. 
Finally, while not required to do so, TVA has elected to implement various FERC orders and regulations pertaining to public utilities on a voluntary basis to the extent that they are consistent with TVA’s obligations under the TVA Act. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
TVA operates its nuclear facilities in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the oversight of the NRC, an independent federal agency that sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow.  The NRC has broad authority to impose requirements relating to the licensing, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities.  In addition, if TVA fails to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA’s operating licenses.
Environmental Protection Agency
TVA is subject to regulation by the EPA in a variety of areas, including air quality control, water quality control, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  See Environmental Matters below.
States
The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states, without federal legislative consent, from regulating the manner in which the federal government conducts its activities.  As a federal agency, TVA is exempt from regulation, control, and taxation by states except in certain areas where Congress has clearly made TVA subject to state regulation. See Environmental Matters below.
22


Other Federal Entities
TVA’s activities and records are also subject to review to varying degrees by other federal entities, including the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB").  There is also an Office of the Inspector General which reviews TVA’s activities and records.
Taxation and Tax Equivalents
TVA is not subject to federal income taxation.  In addition, neither TVA nor its property, franchises, or income is subject to taxation by states or their subdivisions.  The TVA Act, however, does require TVA to make tax equivalent payments to states and counties in which TVA conducts power operations or in which TVA has acquired properties previously subject to state and local taxation.  The total amount of these payments is five percent of gross revenues from the sale of power during the preceding year excluding sales or deliveries to other federal agencies and off-system sales with other utilities, with a provision for minimum payments under certain circumstances.  Except for certain direct payments TVA is required to make to counties, distribution of tax equivalent payments within a state is determined by individual state legislation.
Environmental Matters
TVA's activities, particularly its power generation activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws and regulations relating to air pollution, water pollution, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other issues. Emissions from all TVA-owned and operated units (including small combustion turbine units of less than 25 MWs) have been reduced from historic peaks. Emissions of nitrogen oxide  ("NOx") have been reduced by 94 percent below peak CY 1995 levels and emissions of sulfur dioxide ("SO2") have been reduced by 98 percent below CY 1977 levels through CY 2017. For CY 2017, TVA’s emission of carbon dioxide ("CO2") from its sources was 56 million tons, a 47 percent reduction from CY 2005 levels. This includes 3,049 tons from units rated at less than 25 MWs. TVA intends to continue reporting CO2 emissions on a calendar year basis to align with the EPA's reporting requirements and remain consistent with TVA's prior disclosures.
Clean Air Act
The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control sources of air pollution. The major CAA programs that affect TVA’s power generation activities are described below.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for certain air pollutants. The EPA has done this for ozone, particulate matter ("PM"), SO2, nitrogen dioxide ("NO2"), carbon monoxide, and lead. Over the years, the EPA has made the NAAQS more stringent. Each state must develop a plan to be approved by the EPA for achieving and maintaining NAAQS within its borders. These plans impose limits on emissions from pollution sources, including TVA fossil fuel-fired plants. Areas meeting a NAAQS are designated as attainment areas. Areas not meeting a NAAQS are designated as non-attainment areas, and more stringent requirements apply in those areas, including stricter controls on industrial facilities and more complicated permitting processes. TVA fossil fuel-fired plants can be impacted by these requirements. All TVA generating units are located in areas designated as in attainment with NAAQS.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") in July 2011, requiring several states in the eastern U.S. to improve air quality relative to the CY 1997 ozone NAAQS and the CY 1997 and CY 2006 fine particle NAAQS by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to pollution in other states.  CSAPR replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR"), a similar but less stringent rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") vacated CSAPR before implementation began, but in April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ("Supreme Court") reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded CSAPR back to the D.C. Circuit. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's motion to restore CSAPR but delayed the compliance deadlines by three years.  Under the revised compliance deadlines, Phase I emission reductions in SO2 and NOx became effective on January 1, 2015, and were followed by Phase II reductions on May 1, 2017.  TVA complies with CSAPR aided by significant prior reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions and planned future reductions.

On September 7, 2016, the EPA issued an update to CSAPR ("CSAPR Update Rule") to address cross-state pollution relative to the CY 2008 ozone NAAQS, and also to respond to a July 2015 remand of the CSAPR emission budgets for certain states by the D.C. Circuit.  In this update, the EPA implemented more stringent Phase II reductions for NOx that become effective on May 1, 2017.  TVA has not had and does not currently anticipate significant changes to its operations based on the CSAPR Update Rule.
Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Electric Utility Units. The D.C. Circuit upheld the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") rule on April 15, 2014. In June 2015, however, the U.S. Supreme Court left the rule in place but remanded it back to the D.C. Circuit, finding that the EPA was required to consider cost before deciding whether the regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted from steam electric utilities was appropriate and necessary. In response to the Supreme Court's remand, the EPA published the final Supplemental Finding That It is Appropriate and Necessary to Regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units in April 2016. Several groups have filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit challenging the EPA’s determination. The MATS rule remains in effect while these challenges are pending, 
23


and TVA’s MATS compliance strategy will not be affected by these challenges. On October 5, 2018, the EPA submitted a pre-publication proposal to reconsider the MATS rule to the OMB for interagency review. Until the proposed reconsideration is published and finalized, specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined.
Environmental Agreements. See Note 21 — Legal Proceedings — Environmental Agreements for a discussion of the Environmental Agreements, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 
Acid Rain Program. Congress established the Acid Rain Program to achieve reductions in emissions of SO2 and NOx, the primary pollutants implicated in the formation of acid rain. The program includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants. TVA continues to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from its coal-fired plants, and the SO2 allowances allocated to TVA under the Acid Rain Program are sufficient to cover the operation of its coal-fired plants. In the TVA service area, the limitations imposed on SO2 and NOx emissions by the CSAPR program are more stringent than the Acid Rain Program. Therefore, TVA forecasts that the Acid Rain Program will have no impact on TVA other than administrative reporting.
Regional Haze Program. In June 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, amending its CY 1999 regional haze rule, which had established timelines for states to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the U.S. with a target of reaching no anthropogenic impacts on visibility in these areas by CY 2064. One requirement under the amended rule is that certain types of older existing sources are required to install best available retrofit technology. No additional controls or lower operating limits are required for any TVA units to meet best available retrofit technology requirements. On January 10, 2017, the EPA published the final rule "Protection of Visibility: Amendments to Requirements for State Plans." The rule changed some of the requirements for Regional Haze State Implementation Plans ("Regional Haze SIPs"). TVA does not expect significant impacts to its operations from these changes, but specific impacts cannot be determined until future Regional Haze SIPs are developed.
Opacity. Opacity, or visible emissions, measures the denseness (or color) of power plant plumes and has traditionally been used by states as a means of monitoring good maintenance and operation of particulate control equipment. Under some conditions, retrofitting a unit with additional equipment to better control SO2 and NOx emissions can adversely affect opacity performance, and TVA and other utilities have addressed this issue. The evaluation of utilities' compliance with opacity requirements is coming under increased scrutiny, especially during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Historically, state implementation plans developed under the CAA typically excluded periods of startup, shutdowns, and malfunctions, but on June 12, 2015, the EPA finalized a rule to eliminate such exclusions. The EPA rule required states to modify their implementation plans by November 12, 2016. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi submitted implementation plans, but Alabama has not. Environmental petitioners and several states filed petitions for judicial review of the EPA final rule before the D.C. Circuit. On April 24, 2017, the D.C. Circuit, at the request of the new EPA Administrator, ordered this litigation to be held in abeyance pending the EPA's review to determine whether to reconsider all or part of the rule. TVA does not expect significant impacts from these rule changes. 
Petition to Expand the Ozone Transport Region. On December 9, 2013, eight of the twelve states that make up the Ozone Transport Region ("OTR") submitted a petition, pursuant to section 176A(a) of the CAA, requesting the EPA to add nine states, including Kentucky and Tennessee, to the OTR. The EPA failed to act on the petition within the 180-day period provided under the CAA. On October 6, 2016, six of the eight states filing the petition sued the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, asking the court to require the EPA to act on the petition by a date certain. In response to this lawsuit, the EPA published, on January 19, 2017, a notice in the Federal Register proposing to deny the petition on the basis that the CAA provides other options, such as the use of the “good neighbor provision” in Section 110 and the authority granted states under Section 126 to petition the EPA Administrator to set emission limits, to address the impact of interstate air pollution. The EPA also states that its CSAPR Update Rule is a significant step to control states’ emission reduction obligations under Section 110 to meet the CY 2008 ozone NAAQS. The comment period on this proposal closed on May 15, 2017. On October 27, 2017, the EPA denied the petition. On December 22, 2017, the eight petitioning states filed in the D.C. Circuit a petition for judicial review of the EPA’s denial of the petition to add states to the OTR. Until the court issues its ruling, it is not possible to determine potential impacts to TVA.
Kentucky Startup/Shutdown Regulations. On April 1, 2018, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality published final revised startup/shutdown regulations for new and existing indirect heat exchangers. Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee") and Paradise Fossil Plant ("Paradise") have boilers which will be subject to these rules when incorporated into their air permits. The revised rules do not significantly impact operations at Shawnee or Paradise.
Kentucky State Implementation Plan to Address Downwind Ozone Impacts. Emissions from utility units in Kentucky that contribute to ozone are already limited by the CSAPR Update Rule and are declining. On February 28, 2018, Kentucky submitted a proposed revision to its state implementation plan (“SIP”) to address downwind state ozone impacts. The proposed SIP did not require emission reductions beyond current requirements, and on July 13, 2018, the EPA approved Kentucky's revised SIP. No additional emission reductions are required by the SIP for TVA's Kentucky generating units.
New York Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind High Emitting Sources. On March 12, 2018, the State of New York filed a petition with the EPA under Section 126(b) of the CAA to address ozone impacts on New York from the NOx emissions 
24


from sources emitting at least 400 tons of NOx in CY 2017 from nine states including Kentucky. The New York petition requests that the EPA require daily NOx limits for utility units with SCRs such as Paradise Unit 3 and emission reductions from utility units without SCRs such as Shawnee Units 2, 3 and 5-9. Kentucky utility unit NOx emissions are already limited by the CSAPR Update Rule and are declining, and current EPA modeling projects no additional requirements to reduce Kentucky NOx emissions are necessary. Until the EPA responds to New York’s Section 126(b) petition, it is not possible to determine potential impacts on TVA’s Paradise and Shawnee units.
Proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule. On December 28, 2017, the EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (“ANPR”) to solicit information for a possible future rule: "State Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units." This possible future rule would be a replacement rule for the Clean Power Plan ("CPP") should it be repealed or overturned. The ANPR solicited input on a broad range of issues. On August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule to replace the CPP. The proposed rule sets guidelines requiring states to determine greenhouse gas ("GHG") emission standards for TVA's existing coal-fired units based on efficiency improvements that can be achieved at reasonable cost. TVA operates coal-fired units in Tennessee and Kentucky. Impacts to these units cannot be determined until the EPA finalizes the ACE rule, states submit to the EPA their SIPs implementing guidelines in the ACE rule, and the EPA approves these SIPs. The proposed rule allows states three years to submit their SIPs, and allows the EPA one year for approval.
New Source Performance Standards. On October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized New Source Performance Standards for carbon emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. These standards apply to two types of fossil fuel-fired sources: (1) stationary combustion turbines, generally firing natural gas, and (2) electric utility steam generating units, generally firing coal. These standards reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction ("BSER") that the EPA has determined to be adequately demonstrated for each type of source. These standards apply to the new TVA combined-cycle plants at the Paradise and Allen sites. The design of these plants enables them to comply with the new standards.
Petitions were filed for judicial review of the New Source Performance Standards for carbon emissions. On August 10, 2017, the D.C. Circuit issued an order, at the request of the EPA Administrator, holding the case in abeyance pending the EPA's review of the New Source Performance Standards.
Maryland Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind Electric Generating Units. On September 27, 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit against the EPA for failing to act within 60 days on Maryland’s petition under Section 126 of the CAA to address ozone impacts on Maryland from the NOx emissions of 36 electric generating units, including TVA’s Paradise coal-fired Unit 3. On October 4, 2017, a group of seven environmental advocacy groups filed a similar complaint against the EPA. At issue in Maryland’s petition are alleged excessive NOx emissions from the 36 electric generating units as a result of SCR units not being operated continuously. Paradise coal-fired Unit 3 is equipped with a SCR that TVA continuously operates to the greatest extent technically practicable in order to minimize NOx emissions. On October 5, 2018, the EPA denied Maryland's petition in light of the existing regulations already addressing emissions from the generating units identified in the petition. On October 15, 2018, the State of Maryland filed a petition for judicial review with the D.C. Circuit asking the court to review the EPA's decision.
Climate Change
Executive Actions. On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order ("EO") 13783, “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth.”  The EO reversed or altered many actions taken by the federal government in the last four years of the Obama Administration to address climate change and mandates that federal agencies review existing regulations and actions that potentially burden energy development and use.  Several EOs, policy statements, and reports that established climate change objectives were rescinded or revoked.  EO 13783 did not mandate that the EPA reconsider its finding under the CAA that GHG emissions cause climate change and therefore endanger public health and the environment. 
While EO 13783 requires review of all agency actions that potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources, the final specific requirements and impacts from implementation of this EO are not possible to predict at this time. It is likely that there will be some delay in the development of future GHG reduction requirements. 
On May 17, 2018, EO 13834, "Efficient Federal Operations", was signed. EO 13834 emphasizes meeting statutory requirements and gives agencies greater flexibility and discretion to decide how best to improve operations in order to “optimize energy and environmental performance, reduce waste, and cut costs.” It also calls on the White House Council of Environmental Quality to streamline pre-existing environmental orders by “refocusing agencies on cost-effectively meeting mandates and goals” established by law. The order seeks to consolidate requirements related to energy and water efficiency, high performance buildings, renewable energy consumption, and federal vehicle fleet management. TVA consistently seeks to improve its operations in order to optimize energy and environmental performance and does not anticipate significant changes in its planning or operations as a result of the new EO.
International Accords. On September 3, 2016, the U.S. formally accepted the Paris Agreement. The agreement met the threshold of at least 55 countries that account for at least 55 percent of global GHG emissions and formally entered into 
25


force on November 4, 2016. The durability of the Paris Agreement commitments is uncertain after the President’s announcement on June 1, 2017, that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the earliest possible effective date for withdrawal by the U.S. is November 4, 2020, four years after the agreement came into effect. Future U.S. GHG regulation designed to meet the Paris Agreement goals could impact TVA in ways that cannot be determined at this time.
In response to President Trump’s Paris withdrawal announcement, 17 states have formed the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to reducing GHG emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. North Carolina is the only state in the TVA region that is a U.S. Climate Alliance member. Among other commitments, each state commits to implement policies that advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce GHG emissions by at least 26-28 percent below CY 2005 levels by CY 2025 and to accelerate new and existing policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy deployment at the state and federal level. In June 2017, America's Pledge was announced as a collaborative opportunity for these states to work with U.S. cities and businesses representing more than half of the U.S. economy. In September 2018, America's Pledge released its economy-wide policy analysis with recommendations of how states, cities, businesses, and other stakeholders can influence U.S. decarbonization. It is premature to determine potential impacts to TVA.
Litigation. In addition to legislative activity, climate change issues have been the subject of a number of lawsuits, including lawsuits against TVA. See Note 21 for additional information.
Indirect Consequences of Regulation or Business Trends. Legal, technological, political, and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities and risks. The potential indirect consequences could include an increase or decrease in electricity demand, increased demand for generation from alternative energy sources, and subsequent impacts to business reputation and public opinion. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources above.
Physical Impacts of Climate Change. TVA manages the potential effects of climate change on its mission, programs, and operations within its environmental management processes. The goal of the adaptation planning process is to ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission and program goals and to operate in a secure, effective, and efficient manner in a changing climate by integrating climate change adaptation efforts in coordination with state and local partners, tribal governments, and private stakeholders. TVA's Climate Change Adaptation Plan was last updated in June 2018.
Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions. TVA has reduced GHG emissions from both its generation stations and its operations.  As discussed earlier in this Item 1, Business, recent TVA Board actions have focused on TVA’s plan to balance its coal-fired generation by increasing its nuclear capacity, modernizing its hydroelectric generation system, increasing natural gas-fired generation, installing emission control equipment on certain of its coal-fired units, increasing its purchases of renewable energy, and investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy use in the Tennessee Valley.  Additionally, TVA has invested to reduce energy use in its operations.  The combination of more stringent environmental regulations, lower natural gas prices, and lower demand for energy across the Tennessee Valley has reduced the utilization of coal-fired generation.  These factors have resulted in lower CO2 emissions from the TVA system.
Renewable/Clean Energy Standards
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have established enforceable or mandatory requirements for electric utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources.  One state within the TVA service area, North Carolina, has a mandatory renewable standard that, while not applying directly to TVA, does apply to TVA’s LPCs serving retail customers in that state.  TVA's policy is to provide compliance assistance to any distributor of TVA power, and TVA is providing assistance to the covered LPCs that sell TVA power in North Carolina.  Likewise, the Mississippi Public Service Commission adopted an energy efficiency rule applying to electric and natural gas providers in the state, and TVA is supplying information on participation in TVA's energy efficiency programs to support the covered Mississippi LPCs.  
Water Quality Control Developments
Cooling Water Intake Structures. On May 19, 2014, the EPA released a final rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act relating to cooling water intake structures ("CWIS") for existing power generating facilities. The rule requires changes in CWIS used to cool the vast majority of coal, gas, and nuclear steam-electric generating plants and a wide range of manufacturing and industrial facilities in the U.S.  The final rule requires CWIS to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a cooling water intake structure. These new requirements will potentially affect a number of TVA’s fossil- and nuclear-fueled facilities and will likely require capital upgrades to ensure compliance. Most TVA facilities are projected to require retrofit of CWIS with “fish-friendly” screens and fish return systems to achieve compliance with the new rule. The rule is being implemented through permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") in Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. State agencies administer the NPDES permit program in most states including those in which TVA’s facilities are located.  In addition, the responsible state agencies must provide all permit applications to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for a 60-day review prior to public notice and an opportunity to comment during the public notice. As a result, the permit may include requirements for additional studies of threatened and endangered species arising from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 
26


comments and may require additional measures be taken to protect threatened and endangered species and critical habitats directly or indirectly related to the plant cooling water intake. TVA’s review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for cost-effective compliance.  The required compliance timeframe is linked to plant specific NPDES permit renewal cycles (i.e., technology retrofits), and compliance is expected to be required in the CYs 2022-2024 timeframe.
Hydrothermal Discharges. The EPA and many states continue to focus regulatory attention on potential effects of hydrothermal discharges. Many TVA plants have variances from thermal standards under Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act that are subject to review as NPDES permits are renewed. Specific data requirements in the future will be determined based on negotiations between TVA and regulators. If plant thermal limits are made more stringent, TVA may have to install cooling towers at some of its plants and operate installed cooling towers more often. This could result in a substantial cost to TVA.
Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines. On November 3, 2015, the EPA published a final rule to revise the existing steam- electric effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs") that updates the technology-based water discharge limitations for power plants nationwide.  The CY 2015 ELGs establish more stringent performance standards for existing and new sources that will require power plants that generate more than 50 MW to regulate discharges of toxic pollutants from seven primary wastewater streams.  The primary impact for TVA is on the operation of existing and any potential new coal-fired generation facilities. The rule has the potential to impact long-term investment decisions being made relative to the long-term compliance and operability of TVA coal-fired units. Compliance with new requirements is required in the CYs 2018-2023 timeframe and will necessitate major upgrades to wastewater treatment systems at all coal-fired plants. Dry fly ash handling is mandated by the rule.  The rule also requires either dry bottom ash handling systems or “no discharge” recycle of bottom ash transport waters.  In addition, new technology-based limits on flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater require primary physical or chemical treatment and secondary biological treatment to meet extremely low limits for arsenic, mercury, and selenium. On April 12, 2017, in response to Petitions for Reconsideration by the Utility Water Act Group and the Small Business Administration, the EPA Administrator announced his decision to reconsider the ELG rule.  The EPA also proposed a rule to postpone the rule’s compliance deadlines pending the EPA’s reconsideration of the rule.
On August 11, 2017, the EPA Administrator announced his decision to conduct a rulemaking to potentially revise the new, more stringent effluent limitations that apply to bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater in the CY 2015 rule.  A legal challenge of the rule is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  At the EPA’s request, the court on August 22, 2017, entered an order severing and holding in abeyance the litigation related to the portions of the CY 2015 rule concerning bottom ash transport water, FGD wastewater, and gasification wastewater (which is not applicable to TVA) pending further agency action. Thus, the litigation is indefinitely on hold as to the bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater claims until the EPA’s further rulemaking has concluded. The litigation will continue as to the other claims.  
On September 18, 2017, the EPA published a final rule postponing certain compliance/applicability dates to provide the EPA time to review and revise, as necessary, the new and stringent ELGs previously established for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The EPA pushed back the compliance dates for these two wastestreams from the CYs 2018-2023 timeframe to CYs 2020-2023. Other requirements and applicability dates of the rule for fly ash transport water, flue gas mercury control wastewater, and gasification wastewater remain in effect. As a result of these developments, it is not possible to predict the changes in the rule and TVA’s associated expenditures to attain compliance.
With regard to its Cumberland Fossil Plant ("Cumberland"), TVA contends the ELG rulemaking did not appropriately consider available data that could affect these national limits as they applied at Cumberland given its unique “once-through” scrubber design.  TVA has been working with the State of Tennessee and the EPA in an effort to address this issue. Compliance with the rule at Cumberland without modification to address the unique design could cause TVA to incur disproportionately high costs at Cumberland or experience other operational outcomes that TVA cannot predict at this time. The EPA’s reconsideration of the CY 2015 rule is likely to impact this issue at Cumberland and could result in TVA’s request needing revision or being unnecessary.
Other Clean Water Act Requirements. As is the case in other industrial sectors, TVA and other utilities are also facing more stringent requirements related to the protection of wetlands, reductions in storm water impacts from construction activities, new water quality criteria for nutrients and other pollutants, new wastewater analytical methods, and regulation of pesticide discharges. 
Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes
Liability for releases and cleanup of hazardous substances is imposed under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and other federal and parallel state statutes. In a manner similar to many other industries and power systems, TVA has generated or used hazardous substances over the years.
TVA Sites.  TVA operations at some of its facilities have resulted in contamination that TVA is addressing including at TVA's Environmental Research Center ("ERC") at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. At September 30, 2018, TVA’s estimated liability for cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information was available to develop a cost estimate is approximately $12 million and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the 
27


consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the ERC has an active groundwater monitoring program as part of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") Corrective Action Permit.
Non-TVA Sites. TVA is aware of alleged hazardous-substance releases at certain non-TVA areas for which it may have some liability. See Note 21 — Contingencies — Environmental Matters.
Coal Combustion Residuals. The EPA published its final rule governing coal combustion residuals ("CCR") on April 17, 2015. The rule regulates CCRs as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA. While states may adopt the rule's requirements into their regulatory programs, the rule does not require states to adopt the requirements, nor does it enable states to seek to directly enforce the rule through delegated permitting programs. The rule provides for self-implementation by utilities and allows enforcement through citizen suits in federal court. Although the rule became effective October 19, 2015, certain provisions have later effective dates. TVA’s review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for compliance. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities for a discussion of the impact on TVA’s operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects.

On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIIN Act"), which provides a path to CCR regulation implementation through state or federal-based permitting as an alternative to self-implementation and enforcement through citizen suits in federal courts. Pending adoption of state permitting programs in states in TVA’s service area, TVA does not anticipate any impact on the design or implementation timeframe for TVA’s ongoing CCR activities at this time.
In May 2017, industry petitioners asked the EPA to reconsider the CCR rule and to incorporate new flexibility provided by the WIIN Act – specifically, authority to make site-specific, risk-based decisions on implementing the federal criteria and to postpone upcoming regulatory deadlines during the new rulemaking.  The EPA had previously agreed through settlement to revisit several elements of the CCR rule, so it will already be re-opening the rule.  On September 14, 2017, the EPA announced plans to address the request to revisit key parts of its CY 2015 CCR rule. Subsequently, the EPA issued a proposed rule on March 15, 2018, to amend portions of the CCR rule. The EPA also noted that the March 15 action was the first of two phases of amendments planned for the CCR rule. On July 17, 2018, the EPA issued a final rule which included a subset of the previously proposed changes which provided additional flexibility and an extension of certain deadlines to align the rule with the previously issued Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines rule.  In addition, on September 18, 2017, the EPA filed a motion to hold the CCR litigation in abeyance and to postpone oral argument in the case while it reconsiders the CCR rule.  The D.C. Circuit denied the EPA's motion.  In an August 21, 2018, opinion, the court vacated and remanded to the EPA for additional consideration sections of the CY 2015 CCR rule that allow for continued operation of unlined impoundments in certain situations and that exempt inactive impoundments at inactive facilities from regulation. As a result of these developments, it is not possible to predict changes to the CCR rule and potential impacts on TVA.
In August 2015, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") issued an order that (1) allowed TDEC to oversee TVA’s implementation of the EPA’s CCR rule and (2) required TVA to assess CCR contamination risks at seven of TVA’s eight coal-fired plants in Tennessee and to remediate any unacceptable risks.  The TDEC order does not allege that TVA is violating any CCR regulatory requirements nor does it assess TVA penalties.  The TDEC order sets out an iterative process through which TVA and TDEC will identify and evaluate any CCR contamination risks and, if necessary, respond to such risks. 
On August 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee ordered TVA to excavate the CCR materials from its CCR facilities at Gallatin and move them to a lined facility. A panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed the decision on September 24, 2018. The plaintiffs have petitioned for a rehearing. See Note 8 — Background — Lawsuit Brought by TDEC and Lawsuit Brought by TSRA and TCWN and Note 21 — Legal Proceedings — Cases Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities. 
Groundwater Contamination. Environmental groups and state regulatory agencies are increasing their attention on alleged groundwater contamination associated with CCR management activities.  Seven of TVA’s coal-fired plants are in some level of state regulatory groundwater assessment.  Four of those plants (Colbert Fossil Plant ("Colbert"), Gallatin, Cumberland, and Shawnee) have investigations beyond monitoring and reporting.  Five of those (Gallatin, Shawnee, Paradise, Johnsonville Fossil Plant ("Johnsonville"), and Widows Creek Fossil Plant ("Widows Creek")) have groundwater remediation monitoring with state regulatory involvement. As a result of these assessments and increased attention, TVA may have to change how it manages CCRs at some of its plants, potentially resulting in higher costs. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities, Note 8 — Background — Lawsuit Brought by TDEC and Lawsuit Brought by TSRA and TCWN and Note 21 — Legal Proceedings — Cases Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities.

Environmental Investments
From 1970 to 2018, TVA spent approximately $6.7 billion on controls to reduce emissions from its coal-fired power plants. In addition, TVA has reduced emissions by idling or retiring coal-fired units and relying more on cleaner energy resources including natural gas and nuclear generation.
SO2 Emissions and NOx Emissions.  To reduce SO2 emissions, TVA operates scrubbers on 19 of its coal-fired units and switched to lower-sulfur coal at 13 coal-fired units. To reduce NOx emissions, TVA operates SCRs on 19 coal-fired units, operates low-NOx burners or low-NOx combustion systems on 19 units, operates over-fire air on one cyclone unit, optimized combustion on six units, and operates NOx control equipment year round when units are operating (except during start-up, shutdown, and maintenance periods). TVA has also retired 33 of 59 coal-fired units. Except for seven units at Shawnee, the remaining coal-fired units will have scrubbers and SCRs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above.
Particulate Emissions. To reduce particulate emissions of air pollutants, TVA has equipped all of its coal-fired units with scrubbers, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and/or bag houses.
There could be additional material costs if further reductions of GHGs, including CO2, are mandated by legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions and if more stringent emission reduction requirements for conventional pollutants are established. These costs cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because of the uncertainty of these actions. A number of emerging EPA regulations establishing more stringent air, water, and waste requirements could result in significant changes in the structure of the U.S. power industry, especially in the eastern half of the country.
TVA currently anticipates spending significant amounts on environmental projects through 2025, including investments in new clean energy generation including nuclear and renewables to reduce TVA's overall environmental footprint.  TVA environmental project expenditures also result from coal-fired plant decommissioning and from effective ash management modernization. Based on TVA's decisions regarding certain coal-fired units under the Environmental Agreements, the amount and timing of expenditures could change.  See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above and Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures below.
Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures
The following table contains information about TVA’s current estimates on projects related to environmental laws and regulations.

Estimated Potential Environmental Expenditures(1)(2)At September 30, 2018(in millions)
 | 2019 | | 2020 | | Thereafter(3) | | Total
Coal combustion residual conversion program(4) | $ | 355 | | | $ | 318 | | $ | 505 | $ | 1,178
Clean air control projects(5) | 27 | | | 26 | | | 110 | | 163
Clean Water Act requirements(6) | 46 | | | 33 | | | 387 | | 466

Notes
(1) These estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available and as regulations change.
(2) These estimates include $316 million, $237 million, and $583 million for the remainder of 2019, 2020, and thereafter, respectively, in capital expenditures.
(3) See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies.
(4)  Includes costs associated with pond closures, conversion of wet to dry handling, and landfill activities. TVA is continuing to evaluate the rules and their impact on its operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects. Includes approximately $159 million for Gallatin projects that are part of the original activities scheduled in TVA's CCR Conversion Program and excludes costs resulting from any new requirements related to the Gallatin lawsuits. See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities and Note 8. 
(5)  Includes air quality projects that TVA is currently performing to comply with existing air quality regulations, but does not include any projects that may be required to comply with potential GHG regulations or transmission upgrades.
(6)  Includes projects that TVA is currently planning to comply with revised rules under the Clean Water Act regarding CWIS and ELGs for steam electric power plants.
Employees
On September 30, 2018, TVA had 10,023 employees, of whom 3,402 were trades and labor employees.  Neither the federal labor relations laws covering most private sector employers nor those covering most federal agencies apply to TVA.  However, the TVA Board has a long-standing policy of acknowledging and dealing with recognized representatives of its employees, and that policy is reflected in long-term agreements to recognize the unions (or their successors) that represent TVA employees.  Federal law prohibits TVA employees from engaging in strikes against TVA.
