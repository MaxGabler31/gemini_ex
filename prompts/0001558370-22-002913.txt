Item 1. Business.
​
Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware holding company with operating subsidiaries that provide a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier channels across a service area in over 20 states. We were founded in 1894 as the Mattoon Telephone Company. After several acquisitions, the Mattoon Telephone Company was incorporated as the Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company in 1924. We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002, and through our predecessors, we have been providing communication services in many of the communities we serve for more than 125 years.
​
In addition to our focus on organic growth in our commercial and carrier channels, we have achieved business growth and diversification of revenue and cash flow streams that have created a strong platform for future growth through our acquisitions over the last 15 years. Through this strategic expansion, we have positioned our business to provide competitive services in rural, suburban and metropolitan markets spanning the country. Marking a pivotal moment for Consolidated, in 2020, we entered into a strategic investment with an affiliate of Searchlight Capital Partners L.P. (“Searchlight”). We also completed a global debt refinancing concurrently with the strategic investment, which in combination provides us with greater flexibility to support our fiber expansion and growth plans. The strategic investment offered an immediate capital infusion, delivering significant benefits to the customers and communities we serve, and creating a stronger and more resilient company that is well-positioned to further expand and grow broadband services to meet ever-evolving customer needs.
​
We are closely monitoring the impact on our business of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. For a discussion of the risks related to COVID-19, refer to Part I - Item 1A – “Risk Factors” and for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, refer to Part II - Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in Part II – Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
​
Description of Our Business
​
Consolidated is a broadband and business communications provider offering a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier customers by leveraging our advanced fiber network, which spans approximately 52,400 fiber route miles across many rural areas and metro communities. We offer residential high-speed Internet, video, phone and home security services as well as multi-service residential and small business bundles. Our business product suite 

1




includes: data and Internet solutions, voice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and an expanded suite of cloud services. We provide wholesale solutions to wireless and wireline carriers and other service providers including data, voice, network connections and custom fiber builds and last mile connections. Consolidated is dedicated to turning technology into solutions, connecting people and enriching how our customers work and live. 
​
We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from monthly subscriptions to our broadband, data and transport services (collectively “broadband services”) marketed to residential and business customers. As consumer demands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and upgrading data speeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. Our investment in more competitive broadband speeds is critical to our long-term success. With the initial investment from Searchlight and the concurrent debt refinancing in 2020, we are able to immediately begin the investment in our network to upgrade over five years approximately 1.6 million residential and small business premises to fiber-to-the-home/premise (“FTTP”) enabling multi-Gig symmetrical speeds. The fiber network investments will be made across seven states, including more than 1 million passings within our northern New England service areas. In 2021, we upgraded approximately 330,000 homes and small businesses and launched Fidium Fiber, our new consumer product. We plan to upgrade an additional 400,000 in 2022 and further expand Fidium Fiber in additional regions. By leveraging our existing dense core fiber network and an accelerated build plan, we will be able to significantly increase broadband speeds, expand our multi-Gig coverage and strategically extend our network across our strong existing commercial and carrier footprint to attract more on-net and near-net opportunities. As we invest in network upgrades, we believe we will see stable-to-improved trends in revenue growth and increased broadband penetration. We believe these fiber investments will help us future-proof our network and facilitate the continued transformation of Consolidated into a leading super-regional fiber communications service provider.
​
Searchlight is a strategic partner in our execution of this investment and brings a differentiated perspective to our broadband-first strategy. They are an experienced broadband and fiber infrastructure investor and they bring significant experience investing in FTTP and broadband expansion. Through our partnership with Searchlight, we will pursue targeted investments in our business and future growth opportunities as we transform our company into a leading broadband and solutions provider and create long-term value for our investors, customers and employees. 
​
A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors”, which is incorporated herein by reference.
​
Recent Business Developments
​
On December 7, 2021, we closed on the second stage of the investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) entered into in September 2020 with Searchlight, a global private equity firm. In connection with the Investment Agreement, affiliates of Searchlight have invested an aggregate of $425.0 million in the Company in exchange for a combination of the Company’s Series A perpetual preferred stock and approximately 35% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The investment commitment was structured in two stages, with the initial investment of $350.0 million occurring in October 2020 in conjunction with the Company’s global refinancing. In the second stage, upon receipt of Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and Hart Scott Rodino approvals and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions, Searchlight invested an additional $75.0 million on December 7, 2021. We believe that our strategic investment with Searchlight will enable us to accelerate our growth plan, expand our fiber infrastructure and invest in high-growth and competitive areas of our business. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in Part II – Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a more detailed discussion of this transaction.

​
The telecommunications industry continues to incur increased competition as a result of technology changes, new and emerging providers, and legislative and regulatory developments. Our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and upgrading data speeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as we make increased investments in our fiber infrastructure and the consumer demands for data-based services and faster speeds increase. In addition, we continue to focus on commercial growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for small, medium and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. The expected growth in fiber broadband services will mitigate, in part, the anticipated reduction in the subsidies we receive and declines in traditional voice services impacted by the ongoing industry-wide reduction in access lines. 
​
Commercial and Carrier 
​
Data and Transport Services
​
We provide a variety of business communication solutions to commercial customers of all sizes, including voice and data services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high-speed broadband Internet access and Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system. The package bundles local service, calling features, Internet protocol (“IP”) business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple messaging technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through email.
​
In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including Ethernet services; private line data services; software defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”), a software-based network technology that provides a simplified management and automation of wide area network (“WAN”) connections; multi-protocol label switching (“MPLS”). Our networking services include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers.  We offer a suite of cloud-

3




based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer’s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services. 
​
Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul and other fiber transport solutions with speeds up to 100 Gbps. The demand for backhaul services continue to grow as wireless carriers are faced with escalating consumer and commercial demands for wireless data. 
​
Voice Services 
​
Voice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate.
 ​
Other 
​
Other services include business equipment sales and related hardware and maintenance support, video services and other miscellaneous revenues, including 911 service revenues. We are a full service 911 provider and have installed and maintained two turn-key, state of the art statewide next-generation emergency 911 systems. These systems, located in Maine and Vermont, have processed several million calls relying on the caller's location information for routing. As of October 29, 2020, we were no longer the 911 service provider in Vermont. Next-generation emergency 911 systems are an improvement over traditional 911 and are expected to provide the foundation to handle future communication modes such as texting and video.
​
Consumer 
​
Broadband Services 
​
Broadband services include revenues from residential customers for subscriptions to our VoIP and data products. We offer high-speed Internet access at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, depending on the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location.  Our data service plans also include wireless internet access, email and internet security and protection. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line. We offer multiple voice service plans with customizable calling features and voicemail including voicemail to email options. CCiTV, which is a customizable, cloud-enabled video service available in certain markets, supports a wide variety of viewing habits and provides an app-based approach to video services. The content can be delivered in high-definition quality to a big-screen TV, as well as to tablets and mobile devices.
​
Video Services 
​
Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans, each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and Pay-Per-View channels as well as video on-demand service.  Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (“DVR”) and/or a whole home DVR. Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the home, record multiple shows simultaneously and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. Our TV Everywhere service available in certain markets, allows our video subscribers to watch their favorite shows, movies and livestreams on any device. In addition, we offer several on-demand streaming TV services, which provide endless entertainment options.
​
Voice Services 
​
We offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines.  We expect to continue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product. 
​

Subsidies 
​
Subsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality broadband services at affordable prices with higher data speeds in rural areas.  Subsidies are funded by end user surcharges to which telecommunications providers, including local, long-distance and wireless carriers, contribute on a monthly basis. Subsidies are allocated and distributed to participating carriers monthly based upon their respective costs for providing local service. Similar to access charges, subsidies are regulated by the federal and state regulatory commissions. See Part I – Item 1 – “Regulatory Environment” below and Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business” for further discussion regarding the subsidies we receive.
​
Network Access Services 
​
Network access services include interstate and intrastate switched access, network special access and end user access.  Switched access revenues include access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network.  Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers.  Certain of our network access revenues are based on rates set or approved by the federal and state regulatory commissions or as directed by law that are subject to change at any time.
​
Other Products and Services
​
Other products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising, billing and support services and other miscellaneous revenues such as revenue from our Public Private Partnership arrangements. We have entered into numerous Public Private Partnership agreements with several towns in New Hampshire to build new FTTP Internet networks. The new town networks provide broadband speeds of up to 1 Gbps to residential and commercial customers. Public Private Partnerships are a key component of Consolidated’s commitment to expand rural broadband access.
​
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
​
Wireless Partnerships
​
In addition to our core business, we also derive a portion of our cash flow and earnings from investments in five wireless partnerships. Wireless partnership investment income is included as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of operations. Our wireless partnership investment consists of five cellular partnerships: GTE Mobilnet of South Texas Limited Partnership (“Mobilnet South Partnership”), GTE Mobilnet of Texas RSA #17 Limited Partnership (“RSA #17”), Pittsburgh SMSA Limited Partnership (“Pittsburgh SMSA”), Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(I) Limited Partnership (“RSA 6(I)”) and Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(II) Limited Partnership (“RSA 6(II)”). 
​
Cellco Partnership (“Cellco”) is the general partner for each of the five cellular partnerships. Cellco is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc. As the general partner, Cellco is responsible for managing the operations of each partnership.
​
We own 2.34% of the Mobilnet South Partnership. The principal activity of the Mobilnet South Partnership is providing cellular service in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas metropolitan areas. We account for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value is not readily available for this investment. Income is recognized only upon cash distributions of our proportionate earnings in the partnership.
​
We own 20.51% of RSA #17, which serves areas in and around Conroe, Texas. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Income is recognized on our proportionate share of earnings and cash distributions are recorded as a reduction in our investment.
​
We own 3.60% of Pittsburgh SMSA, 16.67% of RSA 6(I) and 23.67% of RSA 6(II). These partnerships cover territories that almost entirely overlap the markets served by our Pennsylvania Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (“ILEC”) and Competitive Local Exchange Carrier operations. Because of our limited influence over Pittsburgh SMSA, we account for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value is not readily available for this investment. RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) are accounted for under the equity method.

5




​
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized income of $41.8 million, $40.7 million and $37.7 million, respectively, and received cash distributions of $43.0 million, $41.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, from these wireless partnerships.
​
Network Architecture and Technology
​
We have made significant investments in our technologically advanced telecommunications networks and continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve. Our wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network closer to the customer premise, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth services. Our existing network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of wireless data devices in our customers’ homes and businesses.
​
Our networks are supported by advanced 100% digital switches, with a core fiber network connecting all remote exchanges. We continue to enhance our copper network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes. In addition to our copper plant enhancements, we have deployed fiber-optic cable extensively throughout our network, resulting in a 100% fiber backbone network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links, as well as the majority of business parks within our service areas. In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide broadband and long-distance services to our residential and commercial customers. Our fiber network utilizes FTTP and fiber-to-the-node (“FTTN”) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. 
​
We operate advanced fiber networks which we own or have entered into long-term leases for fiber network access. At December 31, 2021, our fiber-optic network consisted of over 52,400 route-miles, which includes approximately 11,910 miles of FTTP deployments, approximately 21,350 route miles of fiber located in the northern New England area, approximately 3,910 miles of fiber network in Minnesota and surrounding areas, approximately 4,650 miles of fiber network in Texas including an expansion into the greater Dallas/Fort Worth market, approximately 1,740 route-miles of fiber-optic facilities in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, approximately 2,290 miles of fiber network in Illinois, approximately 1,150 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in California that cover large parts of the greater Sacramento metropolitan area and approximately 1,120 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in Kansas City that service the greater Kansas City area, including both Kansas and Missouri. Our remaining network includes approximately 4,280 route-miles spanning across various states including portions of Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington. 
​
As of December 31, 2021, we passed more than 2.7 million homes and have direct fiber connections to 14,981 on-net commercial building locations. We intend to continue to make strategic enhancements to our network including improvements in overall network reliability and increases to our broadband speeds. We offer data speeds of up to 1 Gbps in select markets, and up to 100 Mbps in markets where 1 Gbps is not yet available, depending on the geographical region.  As part of the strategic investment and partnership with Searchlight, we plan to accelerate our fiber build plan and extend fiber coverage enabling multi-Gig data speeds to over 70% of our passings by 2025. The upgrades will be made primarily across seven states including more than 1 million passings within the northern New England service areas to significantly enhance our broadband speeds. Further network investments will enable us to continue to meet consumer demand for faster broadband speeds, symmetrical broadband and more bandwidth consumption as well as more effectively serve our commercial customers. 
​
Through our extensive fiber network, we also expect to be able to support the increased demand on wireless carriers for high-capacity transport services. In all the markets we serve, we have launched initiatives to support fiber backhaul services to cell sites. As of December 31, 2021, we had 3,628 cell sites in service and an additional 153 future sites pending completion.

​
Business Strategies
​
Transform our Company into a dominant fiber, gigabit broadband provider
​
In 2020, in connection with the Searchlight investment, we announced plans to upgrade and expand our fiber network through a five-year build plan with construction beginning in early 2021. The build plan will include the upgrade of approximately 1.6 million passings to fiber enabling multi Gigabit-capable services to over 70% of our passings by 2025. In 2021, we built fiber to approximately 330,000 homes and small businesses enabling faster broadband speeds and in 2022, we plan to upgrade an additional 400,000 locations. This marks the biggest fiber deployment project in our Company’s history. Our strategy, supported by the Searchlight investment, is to meaningfully upgrade our residential and small business network in those service territories with a predominantly copper-based infrastructure to a FTTP network. Of the planned upgrades, we expect that more than 1 million passings will be upgraded within the northern New England service areas. We believe that the upgraded network will be capable of providing up to 10 Gbps of symmetrical broadband, which we believe will make us the only broadband provider in these markets capable of delivering 10 Gbps symmetrical broadband to consumers. In addition to best-in-class upload and download speeds, we believe the resulting network will offer better reliability, improved speed consistency, and a lower operating cost relative to competing broadband network technologies. Given these benefits, we believe that our fiber deployment strategy will allow us to realize meaningful improvements in average revenue per user (“ARPU”), broadband subscriber penetration and customer retention.

Continue to grow and invest in commercial and carrier services
​
Our commercial and carrier strategy is built on leveraging our dense fiber network in key markets to offer IP-based products and services to our small and medium-sized business (“SMB”), enterprise and carrier customers. We will continue transitioning our customer base away from legacy TDM-based products to fiber and IP-based data and transport services, where we see significant opportunity to increase market share in our footprint. We will also make strategic network investments in both existing markets and edge-out locations to enhance our footprint and increase on-net and near-net opportunities. These builds will be focused on projects with high revenue visibility and attractive payback periods. Our carrier strategy entails leveraging our dense fiber network and long-term relationships in key markets to expand our carrier partnerships and grow small cell and fiber-to-the-tower connections. Investing not just in the network, but in these customer relationships, has been core to our success. Our growth strategy is also supported by the continuous evolution of our product offerings. We are regularly developing and enhancing our suite of managed and cloud services, increasing efficiency and enabling greater scalability and reliability for our business customers. We believe that by developing and investing in next-generation fiber-based products, we will be able to further support our customer needs for networking, communications, and collaboration services. 
Improve the overall customer experience
​
We continue to evaluate our operations in order to improve and enhance the overall customer experience for all customers. In conjunction with the five-year fiber build plan, we also expect to make significant investments in our back-office infrastructure. We expect our full transformation to occur over a multi-year period. Our planned enhancements include an improved customer portal where customers can manage all aspects of their service. We plan to launch expanded e-commerce, omnichannel customer service and self-service capabilities for all customer groups. We believe that our digital transformation projects will improve our order and install processes making the transition to our services more seamless than ever. Our sales process is also being redesigned in order to provide personalized sales channels and a dedicated care team for our fiber customers. We have a culture of delivering the highest quality customer service experience possible and plan to continue to make investments in our platforms in order to create a truly differentiated customer experience.
​
Competition
​
The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive competition, which has increased significantly in recent years. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, differences in the regulatory environment applicable to comparable alternative services have lowered costs for these competitors. As a result, we face heightened competition but also have new opportunities to grow our broadband business. Our competitors vary by market and may include other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies; cable operators offering video, data and VoIP products; wireless carriers; long distance providers; satellite companies; Internet service providers, fixed wireless Internet service providers (“WISPs”), online video providers and in some cases new forms of providers who are able to offer a broad range of competitive services. We expect competition to remain a significant factor affecting our operating results and that the nature and extent of that competition will continue to increase in the future. See Part I - Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business”.
​
Depending on the market area, we compete against Comcast, Charter, AT&T, Mediacom, Armstrong, Suddenlink, First Light, NewWave Communications and a number of other carriers, in both the commercial and consumer markets. Our competitors offer traditional telecommunications services as well as IP-based services and other emerging data-based services. Our competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services we offer. 
​
We continue to face competition from cable, wireless and other fiber data providers as the demand for substitute communication services, such as wireless phones and data devices, continues to increase. Customers are increasingly foregoing traditional telephone services and land-based Internet service and relying exclusively on wireless service. Wireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies, including 4G and 5G, in order to provide increasingly faster data speeds to their customers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives from federal and state agencies, including federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may also result in other service providers deploying new subsidized fiber networks within our service territories. In addition, the expanded availability for free or lower cost services, such as video over the Internet, complimentary Wi-Fi service and other streaming devices has increased competition among other providers. In order to offer competitive services, we continue to invest in our network and business operations in order to offer new and enhanced services including faster broadband speeds and cloud-enabled services.

​
In our rural markets, services are more costly to provide than services in urban areas as a lower customer density necessitates higher capital expenditures on a per-customer basis. As a result, it may not be economically viable for new entrants to overlap existing networks in rural territories; however, federal and state funding initiatives may enable new entrants to deploy new subsidized networks in our rural markets. Despite the barriers to entry, rural telephone companies still face significant competition from wireless and video providers and, to a lesser extent, competitive telephone companies.
​
Our other lines of business are subject to substantial competition from local, regional and national competitors. In particular, our wholesale and transport business serves other interexchange carriers and we compete with a variety of service providers including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies and other fiber data companies. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, which may result in price compression as customers migrate from legacy data products to lower priced alternatives. For our business systems products, we compete with other equipment providers or value added resellers, network providers, incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, and with cloud and data hosting service providers.
​
We expect that competition across all of our customer channels will continue to intensify as new technologies develop and new competition emerges.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,200 employees, including part-time employees. We also use temporary employees in the normal course of our business. Approximately 48% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2021. For a more detailed discussion regarding how the collective bargaining agreements could affect our business, see Part I - Item 1A – Risk Factors – “Risks Relating to Our Business”.
​
Compensation and Benefits
​
Our employees are the cornerstone of our success. We are committed to providing meaningful, challenging work and opportunities for professional growth in a positive environment. To attract and retain qualified and experienced employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefit packages, which we believe are competitive within the industry and the local markets in which we operate. Our benefit packages may include, among other items, incentive compensation based on the achievement of financial targets, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) savings plan with an employer match, paid time off, and wellness and employee assistance programs. Additionally, for certain eligible directors and employees, we provide long-term incentive compensation, in the form of restricted stock awards. In addition, we are committed to providing employees continuing education and training programs in order for employees to achieve career goals and professional growth.
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We embrace diversity and inclusion and seek to hire and retain high-quality employees of all backgrounds and experiences. Honoring our employees as individuals is key to our culture. We believe diversity of backgrounds contributes to different ideas, which in turn drives better results for customers. We respect differences and diversity as qualities that enhance our efforts as a team and believe embracing diversity and a culture of inclusion makes our company a better place to work. We believe in and support the principles incorporated in all anti-discrimination and equal employment laws. In 2021, we offered leadership Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) training to senior leaders across the Company and formed a new DEI Council which is meeting regularly in 2022 and outlining the roadmap and goals for our Company’s DEI journey. 
​
Safety, Health and Security
​
We also strive to create and provide a safe, healthful and secure workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment. Our workplace policies and procedures protect against behavior that creates an offensive, hostile, or intimidating work environment. Safety is top priority and we have a strong, ongoing commitment to ensure employees are properly trained and have appropriate safety and emergency equipment. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and procedures to protect our employees, customers and business partners. These procedures included transitioning as many employees as possible to remote work-from-home arrangements, providing additional safety training

and personal protective equipment for customer and business partner-facing employees, and complying with social distancing and other health and safety measures as required by federal, state and local governmental agencies. 
​
Regulatory Environment
​
The following summary does not describe all existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry. Regulation can change rapidly and ongoing proceedings and hearings could alter the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us. See Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business”.
​
Overview
​
Our revenues, which include revenues from such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service are subject to broad federal and/or state regulations. The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”), federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. 

At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications.  The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies.  Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations. 

State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers’ facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications.  In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies.  In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks.  State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations. 
​
Federal Regulation
​
Our incumbent local exchange companies and competitive local exchange companies must comply with the Communications Act of 1934, which requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act (contained in the Telecommunications Act discussed below) dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the industry.
​
Access Charges
​
On November 18, 2011, the FCC released its comprehensive order on inter-carrier compensation (“ICC”) and universal service reform. Intrastate network access charges are regulated by state commissions. The FCC order on ICC and universal service reform required terminating state access charges to mirror terminating interstate access charges, and as of July 1, 2013, all terminating switched intrastate access charges mirror interstate access charges.
​
The FCC has structured these prices as a combination of flat monthly charges paid by customers and both usage-sensitive (per-minute) charges and flat monthly charges paid by long-distance or other carriers.
​
The FCC regulates interstate network access charges by imposing price caps on Regional Bell Operating Companies (“RBOCs”) and other large incumbent telephone companies. Some of our properties operate as RBOCs under price cap regulation while some operate under rate of return regulation for interstate purposes. These price caps can be adjusted based on various formulas, such as inflation and productivity, and otherwise through regulatory proceedings. Incumbent telephone companies, such as our incumbent local exchange companies, may elect to base network access charges on price caps, but are not required to do so. 
​

We believe that price cap regulation gives us greater pricing flexibility for interstate services, especially in the increasingly competitive special access market. It also provides us with the potential to increase our net earnings by becoming more productive and introducing new services. As we have acquired new properties, we have converted them to federal price cap regulation.
​
In recent years, carriers have become more aggressive in disputing the FCC’s interstate access charge rates and the application of access charges to their telecommunications traffic. We believe these disputes have increased, in part, because advances in technology have made it more difficult to determine the identity and jurisdiction of traffic, giving carriers an increased opportunity to challenge access costs for their traffic. We cannot predict what other actions other long-distance carriers may take before the FCC or with their local exchange carriers, including our incumbent local exchange companies, to challenge the applicability of access charges. Due to the increasing deployment of VoIP services and other technological changes, we believe these types of disputes and claims are likely to continue to increase.
​
Unbundled Network Element Rules
​
In 2019, the FCC issued two orders on Unbundled Network Element (“UNE”) forbearance. The first order addressed wholesale discounts on resold services and Voice Grade analog UNE loops and the second order (“Transport Order”), addressed UNE transport between competitive wire centers. Both orders provide a three-year transition period.
​
The Transport Order addresses two separate but related topics. One is the relief from transport UNEs and the other is to respond to a remand on its Business Data Services (“BDS”) order. BDS was previously known as Special Access and like services. The FCC broadly deregulated BDS services in 2017. This decision was appealed and the Court upheld the order but vacated the BDS transport relief because the Court decided that the FCC had not provided sufficient notice intended to deregulate all BDS transport services. The Court was convinced not to act on the vacated rules since the ILECs could not easily restore the regulated services. The FCC addressed this issue in the same order used to provide forbearance relief on UNE transport.
​
In 2020, Consolidated renegotiated its Wholesale Performance Plans (“WPP”) in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont to comply with the FCC’s UNE forbearance order issued in 2019.
​
Promotion of Universal Service
​
In general, telecommunications service in rural areas is costlier to provide than service in urban areas.  The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater expenditures per customer to build and maintain.  By supporting the high cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund (“USF”) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas.  Revenues from federal and certain states’ USFs totaled $69.7 million, $72.0 million and $72.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
​
FCC Access Charge and Universal Service Reform Order
​
In November 2011, the FCC released a comprehensive order on access charge and universal service reform (the “Order”). The access charge portion of the Order systematically reduces minute-of-use-based interstate access, intrastate access and reciprocal compensation rates over a six to nine-year period to an end state of bill-and-keep, in which each carrier recovers the costs of its network through charges to its own subscribers, rather than through ICC. The reductions apply to terminating access rates and usage, with originating access to be addressed by the FCC in a later proceeding. To help with the transition to bill-and-keep, the FCC created two mechanisms. The first is an Access Recovery Mechanism (“ARM”) which is funded from the Connect America Fund (“CAF”), and the second is an Access Recovery Charge (“ARC”) which is recovered from end users. The universal service portion of the Order redirects support from voice services to broadband services, and is now called the CAF. 
​
The Order requires rate of return study areas associated with holding companies to be treated as price cap carriers for universal service funding. For ICC purposes, these rate of return carriers fall under the rate of return ICC transition plan. Price cap study areas fall under the price cap rules for both universal service reform and ICC reform.
​

In December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement of 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. 
​
Our annual support through the FCC’s CAF Phase II funding was $48.1 million through 2021 as described below. The specific obligations associated with CAF Phase II funding included the obligation to serve approximately 124,500 locations by December 31, 2020 (with interim milestones of 40%, 60% and 80% completion by December 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively); to provide broadband service with speeds of 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream; to achieve latency of less than 100 milliseconds; to provide data of at least 100 gigabytes per month; and to offer pricing reasonably comparable to pricing in urban areas.  The Company met the buildout milestones and performance metrics requirements for 2017 through 2020 for all states where it received funding. 
​
We accepted CAF Phase II support in all of our operating states except Colorado and Kansas where we declined the offered CAF Phase II support. We continued to receive annual frozen CAF Phase I support of $1.0 million in Colorado and Kansas until April 2019, when the FCC CAF Phase II auction assigned support to another provider.
​
In April 2019, the FCC announced plans for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), the next phase of the CAF program. The RDOF is a $20.4 billion fund to bring speeds of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream to unserved and underserved areas of America. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking at their August 2019 Open Commission Meeting. The order prioritizes terrestrial broadband as a bridge to rural 5G networks by providing a significant weight advantage to traditional broadband providers. Funding will occur in two phases with the first phase auctioning $16.0 billion and the second phase auctioning $4.4 billion, each to be distributed over 10 years. The minimum speed required to receive funding is 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream. CAF Phase II funding was extended through December 31, 2021 for price cap holding companies. The FCC issued the final census block groups with locations and reserve price. We filed the RDOF short form application on July 14, 2020 and were listed as a qualified bidder by the FCC on October 13, 2020 and participated in the auction. The auction began on October 29, 2020 and ended on November 24, 2020. Consolidated won 246 census block groups serving in seven states. The bids we won are at the 1 Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream speed tier to approximately 27,000 locations at a funding level of $5.9 million, which will result in a reduction of approximately $42.2 million in annual support beginning January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2031. Consolidated filed its long form application with supporting documents on January 29, 2021 and received final FCC approval on December 14, 2021.
​
State Regulation
​
We are subject to regulation by state governments in various states in which we operate. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate matters and other requirements. In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs, including our ILEC operations. Nonetheless, state regulatory commissions generally continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) limit ILECs' ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various other service standards. In most states, switched and BDS and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region.
​
We operate in states where traditional cost recovery mechanisms, including state USF, are under evaluation or have been modified. As the states continue to assess their laws and implement various regulations changes, there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to provide us with the same level of cost recovery we historically received.
​
Local Government Authorizations
​
In the various states we operate in, we operate under a structure in which each municipality or other regulatory agencies may impose various fees, such as for the privilege of originating and terminating messages and placing facilities within the municipality, for obtaining permits for street opening and construction, and/or for operating franchises to install and expand fiber optic facilities. 
​

Regulation of Broadband and Internet Services
​
Video Services
​
Our cable television subsidiaries each require a state or local franchise or other authorization in order to provide cable service to customers. Each of these subsidiaries is subject to regulation under a framework that exists in Title VI of the Communications Act.
​
Under this framework, the responsibilities and obligations of franchising bodies and cable operators have been carefully defined. The law addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights-of-way; the carriage of public, educational and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection and similar issues. In addition, Federal laws place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel video distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area. Many provisions of the federal law have been implemented through FCC regulations. The FCC has expanded its oversight and regulation of the cable television-related matters recently. In some cases, it has acted to assure that new competitors in the cable television business are able to gain access to potential customers and can also obtain licenses to carry certain types of video programming.
​
Internet Services
​
The provision of Internet access services is not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority to regulate Internet Service Providers with respect to privacy and competitive practices. In 2017, the FCC adopted an order eliminating its previous classification of Internet service as a telecommunications service regulated under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This effectively limits the FCC’s authority over Internet Service Providers. The FCC retained rules requiring Internet Service Providers to disclose practices associated with blocking, throttling and paid prioritization of Internet traffic. The FCC order has been challenged in court and the outcome of the challenge cannot be determined at this time. 
​
The outcome of pending matters before the FCC and the FTC and any potential congressional action cannot be determined at this time but could lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of Internet services, and could affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve.
​
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act Funding
​
States are reviewing opportunities to use federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) funding to assist in the deployment of broadband to unserved and underserved areas within their respective states. In 2020, New Hampshire allocated $50.0 million of CARES Act funding to fund broadband expansion to unserved and underserved locations throughout the state. Consolidated was granted up to $3.5 million to build high-speed Internet networks for homes and businesses in New Hampshire for the towns of Danbury, Springfield and Mason. The state funded 10% upfront with the remainder received upon completion of projects in December 2020. 
​
American Rescue Plan Act Funding
​
President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) on March 11, 2021. States have been allocated federal funds to be utilized for capital infrastructure, including broadband deployment, and are in various stages of implementation. We are working with the states and municipalities, in which we operate, to participate in this broadband grant program.
​
COVID-19
​
On March 13, 2020, the FCC issued a pledge to Keep America Connected through May 13, 2020, which was later extended to June 30, 2020. The pledge asked all communications providers to not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic; to waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incur because of their economic circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic; and to open their Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them.
​

13




Consolidated signed on to the pledge through June 30, 2020. Several states took the FCC pledge a step further by not allowing any carrier to disconnect service within their state during the Governors’ declared state of emergency, which Consolidated also supported. Most state moratoriums on disconnections have expired; however, certain states such as Washington and New York were extended to July 31, 2021 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
​
In February 2021, the FCC created the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (“EBB”), a temporary program to help low income households stay connected during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing broadband service discounts for eligible households. Consolidated is a participant in this program. The EBB ended on December 31, 2021. EBB recipients fully enrolled as of December 31, 2021 automatically continued to receive their current monthly benefit until March 1, 2022 when the Affordable Connectivity Program took its place.
​
Affordable Connectivity Program 
​
The Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”) is a permanent broadband affordability program set up to replace the EBB. The ACP program helps ensure that households can afford the broadband they need for work, school, healthcare and more. The benefit provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price. The ACP is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per household. The program begins funding March 1, 2022. Consolidated will be participating in this program.
​
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
​
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“Infrastructure Act”) passed on March 31, 2021 included $65.0 billion toward broadband. The broadband internet portion of the Infrastructure Act is aimed at increasing internet coverage for more universal access, including for rural, low-income, and tribal communities. 65% of this funding is set aside specifically for underserved communities. Additionally, this measure is designed to help make internet access more affordable and increase digital literacy.
​
The Infrastructure Act set aside $42.5 billion for Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment grants. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration administers the grant program and is in the process of soliciting comments before issuing final rules.
