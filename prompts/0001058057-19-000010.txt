Item 1. | Business

Overview
Marvell Technology Group Ltd., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Marvell,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is a fabless semiconductor provider of high-performance application-specific standard products. Our core strength is developing highly integrated and complex System-on-a-Chip (“SoC”) devices, leveraging our technology portfolio of intellectual property in the areas of analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. We also develop integrated hardware platforms along with software that incorporates digital computing technologies designed and configured to provide an optimized computing solution. Our broad product portfolio includes devices for storage and networking. We were incorporated in Bermuda in January 1995.
On July 6, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Cavium (the “Cavium acquisition”). The Cavium acquisition was primarily intended to create an opportunity for the combined company to emerge as a leader in infrastructure solutions. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 19, 2017, by and among the Company and Cavium (the “Cavium merger agreement”), the Company acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of Cavium (the “Cavium shares”) for $40.00 per share in cash and 2.1757 shares of the Company’s common stock exchanged for each share of Cavium stock. The merger consideration was funded with a combination of cash on hand, new debt financing and issuance of the Company’s common shares. See “Note 5 - Business Combination” for discussion of the acquisition and “Note 12 - Debt” for discussion of the debt financing in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Markets and Products
Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a supplier of stand-alone semiconductor components to a supplier of fully integrated platform solutions. We have been focusing our investment on infrastructure markets such as enterprise, datacenter and service provider networks and have reduced our investment in consumer markets such as personal computers. Infrastructure markets have a number of very attractive attributes including long product lifecycles, deep customer relationships and typically sole-sourced design wins. Our platform solutions contain multiple intellectual property components in integrated hardware, along with software that incorporates digital, analog and mixed-signal computing and communication technologies, designed and configured to provide an optimized solution. Our solutions have become increasingly integrated, with more and more components resulting in an all-in-one solution for a given customer’s end product. The demand for such highly integrated platform solutions is generally driven by technological changes and anticipation of the future needs of device manufacturers and end users, including enterprises, campus and service provider networks and, to an increasing extent, data center providers. 
A device manufacturer may require technologies leveraged from one end market product into products for other end markets, integrating components and technologies traditionally associated with one end market with components and technologies from another end market. The integration of these various technologies onto a single piece of silicon is referred to as SoC.
In addition, software has become increasingly important to our business over the last several years and we believe software will become even more relevant as the market expects hardware and software to be delivered as an integrated solution. On-chip software, which acts as the “driver” for the functionality of the chip, has always been a critical part of our business. However, the software and application-level software that we deliver with our products have become significantly more complex as the range of uses and the needs have increased.

Our current product offerings are primarily in two broad product groups: storage and networking. In storage, we are a market leader in fibre channel products and data storage controller solutions spanning cloud, enterprise, edge and personal computing markets. Our networking products include ethernet solutions, embedded processors and WiFi connectivity solutions. These products address multiple end markets in cloud, consumer, enterprise, and service provider networks. 
In connection with the November 2016 announcement of our plan to restructure our operations to refocus our research and development, increase operational efficiency and improve profitability, we divested three businesses in fiscal 2018. As required, we have retrospectively recast our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, the following discussion refers to our continuing operations. As part of our restructuring initiated in July 2018, our former Networking and Connectivity product group was combined and named Networking. Prior years’ amounts have been revised to conform to the current year’s presentation. Our net revenue by product group for the last three fiscal years is as follows:

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We have determined that we operate in one reportable segment: the design, development and sale of integrated circuits. For information regarding our revenue by geographic area, and property and equipment by geographic area, please see “Note 18 — Segment and Geographic Information” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.    
Customers, Sales and Marketing
Our target customers are original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers, both of which design and manufacture end market devices. Our sales force is strategically aligned along key customer lines in order to offer fully integrated platforms to our customers. In this way, we believe we can more effectively offer a broader set of content into our key customers’ end products, without having multiple product groups separately engage the same customer. We complement and support our direct sales force with manufacturers’ representatives for our products in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we have distributors who support our sales and marketing activities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also use third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ facilities. We expect that a significant percentage of our sales will continue to come from direct sales to key customers.
We use field application engineers to provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems designs that incorporate our products. Our marketing team works in conjunction with our field sales and application engineering force, and is organized around our product groups.
Historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Net revenue attributable to significant customers whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues is presented in the following table:

 | Year Ended 
 | February 2, 2019 | | February 3, 2018 | | January 28, 2017
Customer: | | | | | 
Western Digital | 12 | % | | 20 | % | 21 | %
Toshiba * | 11 | % | | 14 | % | 14 | %
Seagate | 10 | % | | 11 | % | 9 | %
Distributor: | | | | | 
Wintech | ** | | | 10 | % | 10 | %
* The percentage of net revenue reported for Toshiba for fiscal year 2019 excludes net revenue of Toshiba Memory Corporation after Toshiba divested Toshiba Memory Corporation during fiscal year 2019.** Less than 10% of net revenue

Some of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronics products, including gaming devices and personal computers, which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand. Seasonality, including holiday buying trends, may at times negatively impact our results in the first and fourth quarter, and positively impact our results in the second and third quarter of our fiscal years. In addition, the timing of new product introductions by our customers may cause variations in our quarterly revenues, which may not be indicative of future trends.
Inventory and Working Capital
We place firm orders for products with our suppliers generally up to 16 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product. These lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries. We often maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. 
Backlog
We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful or reliable indicator for future demand, due to the following:

• | an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change orders prior to the scheduled shipment dates;


• | a portion of our revenue comes from products shipped to customers using third-party logistics providers, or “hubs” wherein the product can be pulled at any time by the customer and is therefore never reflected in backlog

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost-effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.
We have assembled a core team of engineers who have experience in the areas of mixed-signal circuit design, digital signal processing, embedded microprocessors, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology and system-level architectures. We have invested and will continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Manufacturing
Integrated Circuit Fabrication
The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.
Assembly and Test
We outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
Environmental Management
We believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors complies with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.

Intellectual Property
Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of February 2, 2019, we have approximately 10,000 U.S. and foreign patents issued and approximately 1600 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending on various aspects of our technology. While we believe the duration of our patents generally covers the expected lives of our products, our patents may not collectively or individually cover every feature on innovation in our product. In addition, our efforts may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property.
We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.
From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.
The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties.
In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused other intellectual property rights, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents, trademarks, or other rights. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patent litigation matters.
Competition
The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and pricing pressures. Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of performance and integration and smaller process geometries. We expect competition to intensify as current competitors continue to strengthen the depth and breadth of their product offerings, either through in-house development or by acquiring existing technology. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

• | the performance, features, quality and price of our products;


• | the timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;


• | emergence, rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;


• | our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity with the appropriate technological capability; and


• | the number and nature of our competitors in a given market.

Our major competitors for our products include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Aquantia Corporation, Broadcom Limited, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Inphi Corporation, Intel Corporation, MediaTek Inc., Mellanox Technologies Limited, Microchip Technology Inc., NXP Semiconductors N.V., Phison Electronics Corporation, Qualcomm Inc., Quantenna Communications Inc. and Silicon Motion Technology Corporation. We expect increased competition in the future from emerging or established companies, or alliances among competitors, customers or other third parties, any of which could acquire significant market share. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of competitive risks associated with our business. 
Historically, average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general, and for our products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and reduce the cost of our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pricing risks.
