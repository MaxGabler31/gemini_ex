Item 1. Business
We meet the conditions specified in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K and are thereby permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly-owned subsidiaries of reporting companies specified therein. Accordingly, in lieu of the information called for by Part I Item 1 “Business,” we have included a brief description of the business transacted during the most recent fiscal year that in our management’s opinion indicates the general nature and scope of our business.
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in June 2006. On April 26, 2018, Archrock completed the acquisition of all of our outstanding common units that it did not already own and, as a result, we became its wholly-owned subsidiary. 
We are a leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. Our business supports a must-run service that is essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas. Our geographic diversity and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S. We operate in one segment. 
We do not have any employees. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement (see Note 5 (“Related Party Transactions”) to our Financial Statements), we reimburse Archrock for the allocated cost of its personnel who provide direct and indirect support for our operations.

Merger Transaction
On April 26, 2018, Archrock completed the acquisition of all of our outstanding common units that it did not already own and, as a result, we became its wholly-owned subsidiary. Additionally, all outstanding treasury units were retired and our incentive distribution rights, all of which were owned by Archrock prior to the Merger, were canceled and ceased to exist. As a result of the Merger, our common units are no longer publicly traded. See Note 10 (“Partners’ Capital”) to our Financial Statements for further details of the Merger.
Amendment to the Credit Facility and Revolving Loan Agreement with Archrock
On April 26, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Merger and pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the aggregate revolving commitment under the Credit Facility increased from $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. Also in conjunction with the closing of the Merger, we entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement with Archrock under which we may make loans to Archrock with borrowings from the Credit Facility. See Notes 9 (“Long-Term Debt”) and 5 (“Related Party Transactions”) to the Financial Statements for further details of Amendment No. 1 and the Revolving Loan Agreement, respectively.
Contract Operations Services Overview
We provide comprehensive contract operations services including the personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression needs. 
Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired higher pressure for transportation from one point to another. It is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along intrastate and interstate pipelines.
Our contract operations services are based on the operating specifications at the customer location and each customer’s unique needs and include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining equipment. When providing contract operations services, we work closely with a customer’s field service personnel so that the compression services can be adjusted to efficiently match changing characteristics of the natural gas reservoir and the natural gas produced. We routinely repackage or reconfigure a portion of our existing fleet to adapt to our customers’ compression needs. We primarily utilize reciprocating compressors driven by internal natural gas-fired combustion engines.
