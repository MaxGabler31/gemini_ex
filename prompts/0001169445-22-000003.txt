ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
CPSI is a leading provider of healthcare solutions and services for community hospitals and other healthcare systems and post-acute care facilities. Founded in 1979, CPSI offers its products and services through six companies - Evident, LLC ("Evident"), TruBridge, LLC ("TruBridge"), American HealthTech, Inc. ("AHT"),  iNetXperts, Corp. d/b/a Get Real Health ("Get Real Health"), TruCode LLC ("TruCode") and Healthcare Resource Group, Inc. ("HRG"). These combined companies are focused on improving the health of the communities we serve, connecting communities for a better patient care experience, and improving the financial operations of our clients. The individual contributions of each of these companies towards this combined focus are as follows:
•Evident, which makes up our acute Care EHR reporting segment, provides comprehensive acute care electronic health record ("EHR") solutions, Thrive and Centriq, and related services for community hospitals and their physician clinics.
•AHT, which makes up our post-acute Care EHR reporting segment, provides a comprehensive post-acute care EHR solution and related services for skilled nursing and assisted living facilities.
•TruBridge, our third reporting segment, focuses on providing business management, consulting, and managed information technology ("IT") services along with its complete revenue cycle management ("RCM") solution for all care settings, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider.
•Get Real Health, included within our TruBridge segment, delivers technology solutions to improve patient outcomes and engagement strategies with care providers.
•TruCode, included within our TruBridge segment, offers a cloud-based medical coding solution for hospitals of all sizes that improves productivity, accuracy and compliance, resulting in improved revenue cycle performance.
•HRG, which was acquired on March 1, 2022 and will be included within our TruBridge segment, provides specialized RCM solutions for facilities of all sizes.
Our companies currently support acute care facilities and post-acute care facilities with a geographically diverse customer mix primarily within the domestic community healthcare market. Our target market for our acute care solutions includes community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds. Our primary focus within this defined target market is on hospitals with fewer than 100 beds, which comprise approximately 98% of our acute care hospital EHR customer base. Our target market for our TruBridge services includes community hospitals with fewer than 600 acute care beds. The target market for our post-acute care solutions consists of approximately 15,500 skilled nursing facilities that are either independently owned or part of a larger management group with multiple facilities. During 2021, we generated revenues of $280.6 million from the sale of our products and services.
Industry Dynamics
The healthcare industry is the largest industry in the United States economy, comprising approximately 19.7% of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2020 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). CMS estimates that national health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4% for 2019 through 2028 and will reach $6.2 trillion in 2028.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in historic challenges for hospitals and health systems and the communities they serve. Hospitals and health systems are navigating financial and operational pressures that include: the high costs associated with preparing for a surge of COVID-19 patients and resource-intensive treatment, added expense due to supply chain and labor market disruptions, and loss of revenue due to lower patient volumes for nonemergent care.
Hospital expenditures grew by 6.4% to approximately $1.3 trillion in 2020, slightly faster than the 6.3% growth in 2019. According to the American Hospital Association’s AHA Hospital Statistics, 2021 Edition, there are approximately 3,900 community hospitals in the United States that are in our target market of hospitals with fewer than 200 beds, with approximately 2,900 of those in our primary area of focus of fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, there is a market of small specialty hospitals that focus on discrete medical areas such as surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care.
Notwithstanding the size and importance of the healthcare industry within the United States economy, the industry is constantly challenged by changing economic dynamics, increased regulation and pressure to improve the quality of healthcare. These challenges are particularly significant for the hospitals in our target market due to their more limited financial and human resources and their dependency on Medicare and Medicaid populations for a substantial portion of their revenue. However, we believe healthcare providers can successfully address these issues with the help of advanced medical information systems and our suite of complementary services. Specific examples of the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare providers include the following:
Changing Economic Dynamics
The economy of the healthcare industry, although not immune to general macroeconomic conditions, is heavily impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal and state governments. These legislative and regulatory initiatives have a particularly significant impact on our customer base, as community hospitals typically generate a significant portion of their revenues from beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Consequently, even small changes in these federal and state programs have a disproportionately larger effect on community hospitals as compared to larger facilities where greater portions of their revenues are typically generated from beneficiaries of private insurance programs. Medicare and Medicaid funding and reimbursements fluctuate year to year and, with the growth in healthcare costs, will continue to be scrutinized as the federal and state governments attempt to control the costs and growth of the program. The Medicaid program, which is a federal/state program managed by the individual states and dependent in part on funding from the states, also continues to experience funding issues due to the increasing cost of healthcare and limited state revenues.
Mandatory cuts in federal spending resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the "Budget Control Act") became effective in March 2013. Although Medicaid is specifically exempted from the cuts mandated by the legislation, the Budget Control Act includes a reduction of up to 2% in federal Medicare spending, which has been achieved by reduced reimbursements to healthcare providers. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"), has put into effect a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare and Medicaid program spending by significant amounts. As the federal government seeks in the future to further limit deficit spending due to fiscal restraints, it will likely continue to cut entitlement spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid matching grants, which will place further cost pressures on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Furthermore, federal and state budget shortfalls, exacerbated by the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, as described below, could lead to potential reductions in funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Further reductions in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid could lead to hospitals postponing expenditures on information technology.
While legislative and regulatory initiatives are placing significant pressure on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, our customer base of community hospitals is also likely faced with increases in demand for Medicare and Medicaid services. We expect that the demand for Medicare and Medicaid services will increase for the foreseeable future due to the growing number of people born during the post-World War II baby boom that are becoming eligible for Medicare benefits at age 65, as well as states electing to expand Medicaid coverage under the provisions of the ACA. The challenges posed by this dual-threat of increased demand for Medicare and Medicaid services and downward pressure on reimbursements are further complicated by the shift away from volume-based reimbursement towards value-based reimbursement, linking reimbursement to quality measurements and outcomes.
Compounding the combined effects of a likely increase in demand for Medicare and Medicaid services and persistent pressure on related reimbursements, the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and value-based reimbursement models is transforming domestic healthcare delivery into a more patient-centric experience. This transformation brings about new and increased data needs, resulting in additional regulatory demands for data that patients find useful in decision-making. These new regulatory demands increase regulatory risks and compliance burdens for CPSI and our clients, but also pose opportunities for CPSI to provide additional value-added products and services to our target market.
One such regulatory demand, the price transparency mandate, became effective in January 2021 for all U.S. hospitals. This mandate requires that hospitals publicly post, online and in a searchable, consumer-friendly manner, standard charge information for at least 300 shopable services, which gives patients the ability to compare payer-specific negotiated charges across healthcare settings. In response to this mandate, we announced in July 2020 the availability of a pricing transparency solution that gives patients the ability to shop for healthcare services based on price, supporting a more patient-driven healthcare experience. In mid-2021, CMS published additional commentary around price transparency requirements. Based on that additional commentary, we have continued to make additional enhancements to our price transparency solutions, specifically around the areas of payor-specific rates and the generation of patient estimates within the web based portal.
To compete in the continually changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly using technology in order to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices, to assist in enhancing patient care, and to maintain the privacy and security of patient information. Healthcare providers are placing increased demands on their information systems to accomplish these tasks. We believe that information systems must facilitate management of patient information across administrative, financial and clinical tasks. Information systems must also effectively interface with a variety of payor organizations within the increasingly complex reimbursement environment.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
In 2009, the U.S. federal government enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the "ARRA"), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"). HITECH authorized the EHR incentive program, which provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The level to which healthcare providers must prove they are effectively utilizing such solutions in order to qualify for these incentives is measured through an escalating criteria designated as "meaningful use." 
Compliance with the meaningful use rules accelerated the purchases of incremental applications by our existing clients. Consequently, our penetration rates within our existing customer base for our current menu of applications have increased significantly under the ARRA, thereby significantly narrowing the market for add-on sales to existing clients in future years. As a result of the announcement from CMS on August 2, 2018 of a final rule changing the attestation period for 2019 and 2020 to any continuous 90-day period instead of the previously-required full year attestation period, hospitals had until October 1, 2019 to install compliant technology in order to meet the requirements of the program during 2019, compared to a deadline of January 1, 2019 under the previous rule. The stage three requirements of the meaningful use program (re-named "Promoting Interoperability" by such rule) provided a significant opportunity for add-on sales revenues during 2017 through 2019. The passing of the October 1, 2019 compliance deadline resulted in reduced MU3-related revenue opportunities throughout 2020 and 2021. 
Continued Push for Improved Patient Care
With the increased pressure to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce costs, there is a general shift towards value-based reimbursement, which increases the demand for information technology solutions for clinical decision support. This migration toward clinical decision support solutions is further supported by the ARRA. 
In the face of decreasing revenue and increasing pressure to improve patient care, healthcare providers are in need of management tools and related services that (1) increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services, (2) reduce medical errors, (3) effectively track the cost of delivering services so that those costs can be properly managed and (4) increase the speed and rate of reimbursement. A hospital’s failure to adequately invest in a modern medical information system could result in fewer patient referrals, cost inefficiencies, lower than expected reimbursement, increased malpractice risk and possible regulatory infractions. Additionally, we believe that the industry will continue to increase its utilization of third party services that contribute to the achievement of these and other objectives necessary for success in the current environment. We believe these dynamics should allow for future revenue growth for both our information technology solutions and our complementary suite of services.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The healthcare industry remains at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, with heroic efforts by healthcare providers on the frontlines and advances in technology and science bringing vaccines to market in an unprecedented timeframe. Looking beyond 2021, we believe the pandemic could lead to an acceleration of macro trends already developing in the industry. For example, it is likely that the pandemic advances the role of the federal government as the top regulator and payor for healthcare and that financial distress resulting from the pandemic increases the pace of health system consolidations. Additionally, the quick pivot to virtual healthcare in response to the pandemic has increased consumer expectations, particularly around the convenience of telemedicine and digital health options.
This quick pivot to virtual healthcare accelerated the ongoing increasing demand for telemedicine solutions and services, with recent history suggesting an evolving reimbursement environment that is becoming more receptive to telemedicine with each passing year. In response to this trend and the necessity for virtual care imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the product roadmap for Get Real Health’s Talk With Your Doc telehealth portal. The product was introduced for general release by April 2020 and was provided to customers free of charge for the remainder of 2020 and throughout 2021.
Strategy
Our objective is to increase the market share of our TruBridge services, aggressively pursue competitive and vulnerable EHR replacement opportunities, and differentiate our products and services on a client experience basis that enables us to sell a broader set of services into a loyal base of clients that are our advocates. After partnering with a premium consulting firm to review our business and growth opportunities, 2021 marked the beginning of implementing a strategy to grow our core business while investing in new technologies and improving profitability. We are focused on the execution of our transformation initiative that continues to guide our strategic efforts to achieve core growth, margin optimization, and tangible upside through digital innovation:
•Core Growth: Our core growth initiatives include cross-selling TruBridge into the existing EHR base, expanding TruBridge market share with sales to new community and larger health systems, and pursuing competitive EHR takeaway opportunities.
•Margin Optimization: These efforts support the core growth efforts as we routinely seek, find and execute on initiatives that modernize our business, increasing our efficiency and resulting in cost savings that we can then use to invest in additional growth.
•Digital Innovation: Running parallel to our core growth and margin optimization initiatives is the upside, future growth component of our plan representing new and larger adjacency opportunities. The market drivers that fuel the pursuit of new innovation include an increased appetite for patient engagement, industry insights, reporting and analytics technology.
The healthcare industry is in the midst of transitioning to value-based reimbursement, care coordination and interoperability. Our strategy is to position our services and solutions with community healthcare providers so that they are able to respond to these changes positively by enabling them to improve community health and connect providers and patients within the community and with other communities, while improving financial operations. We intend to leverage several strengths to accomplish this goal.
Market Share/Scale 
Over the course of our more than 40 year history of providing valuable technology solutions and services to the acute care and post acute care environments, we have developed a significant customer base of community hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. This customer base is our most valuable asset, providing us with the critical mass necessary to scale our development, client support and service resources to meet the ever changing needs of our customers. In doing so, we solidify our position as a long-term partner with a proven track record in meeting the unique needs of community healthcare.
EHR Solutions Across the Care Continuum
Our EHR solutions address the entire continuum of care, with systems that address the three primary care settings: ambulatory care, inpatient acute care and post-acute care. This enables providers to coordinate patient care across the major settings where care is delivered. New payment models in both the government and private payer sectors are focused on payment for delivering quality outcomes and keeping patients well while still delivering financial efficiencies. These financial efficiencies are realized through the elimination of duplicate tests performed in different care settings, as well as providing timely access to clinical information from other care settings, when making diagnostic decisions. Having integrated solutions across the care continuum facilitates this process for providers and healthcare organizations.
Solutions and Services to Address Value-Based Reimbursement
With the continued emphasis on value-based reimbursement models, data analytics has become a critical tool for community healthcare providers to enable them to shift from reactive to proactive care delivery. We currently offer business intelligence as the first facet of a three-phase approach to analytics solutions, which we plan to expand to include predictive and prescriptive analytics. Because of the complexity inherent in data analytics, we will provide services to healthcare providers to assist them with certain aspects of data modeling and data analysis.
Interoperability
We currently provide integration across our ambulatory and inpatient EHR solutions. This integration was expanded to encompass our post-acute care EHR product in 2016. In addition, as a founding member of the CommonWell Health Alliance, we enable healthcare organizations to identify, confirm and link patient encounters across the CommonWell network. This translates into patient data that is not only shareable within communities but across communities as well.
Focus on the Financial Health of Community Healthcare Providers
Given the ongoing transition to value-based reimbursement models, community healthcare providers are under more financial pressure than ever before, and financial health and stability is essential to their longevity and survival. Our accounts receivable management services incorporate proven workflow and processes as well as industry leading revenue cycle management tools. A new aspect of many current payment models is an increasing shift of the financial burden to the patient. Community hospitals typically underperform in private pay collections because of the nature of community healthcare but cannot afford to forego the patient portion of contributions. Through our private pay services, providers can bring in much needed private pay receipts without alienating the local community.
Our operational expertise and technology tools provide proven results in improving claim acceptance rates, accelerating payments from third party payers and increasing private pay collections. We also differentiate our services by working to maintain employment in the community by hiring displaced employees into TruBridge to continue their functional role under TruBridge program management.
Strategic Uses of Capital
2020 marked the culmination of a years-long evolution in the capital allocation strategy of CPSI, a strategy designed to afford the flexibility necessary to be adaptive and opportunistic with future capital allocation decisions. Such flexibility is necessary if we are to continue to bring timely products and services to a rapidly changing healthcare landscape, serving the needs of multiple stakeholder groups as customers benefit from the related products and services and our stockholders benefit from the increasing diversity in revenue sources. Specific components of this years-long evolution include:
•Reducing our leverage profile, while increasing capital availability: From December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2021, our total bank debt decreased from $143.5 million to $100.4 million, while the amount available under our revolving credit facility has increased from $17.0 million to $79.0 million. 
•Refinancing our debt: In June 2020, we refinanced our outstanding indebtedness with the primary objectives of increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $50.0 million to $110.0 million and removing absolute-dollar limits on acquisition activity.
•Announcing a share repurchase program, while simultaneously suspending all quarterly dividends: In September 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $30.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock over a two-year period. Concurrent with the approval of the stock repurchase program, the Board of Directors opted to indefinitely suspend all quarterly dividends. These joint actions allow CPSI to continue its commitment to returning capital to shareholders, while at the same time enhancing our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing landscape of alternative uses of capital.
This evolution in CPSI's capital allocation strategy created the flexibility necessary to opportunistically pursue value-enhancing acquisitions, including the 2019 acquisition of Get Real Health, the May 2021 acquisition of TruCode, and the March 1, 2022 acquisition of HRG.
Explore Additional Revenue Streams that Complement Existing Markets, Solutions and Services
In the EHR space, we are selling our ambulatory EHR solutions on a standalone basis with a focus on communities that already have one of our EHR solutions installed in an acute care setting. Also, we are actively pursuing expansion of our inpatient EHR product into the Canadian market through our own direct efforts and collaboration with key Canadian technology providers. In the United States EHR market, we are targeting other types of providers who have lagged behind inpatient acute care in EHR adoption such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral health facilities and inpatient psychiatric hospitals. In the post-acute care market, we are now providing an EHR solution for assisted living facilities in conjunction with our own post-acute care EHR for skilled nursing operators. In the services business we will continue to look for opportunities to add or increase services resulting from changing market dynamics, availability of technology or operational expertise, or changes in regulatory requirements. 
Our Products and Services
Evident and American HealthTech provide tailored IT solutions that effectively address the specific needs of small and midsize hospitals and their physician clinics, as well as skilled nursing facilities of all sizes across the U.S. Their broad offerings of software products and services collect, process, retain, and report data in the primary functional areas of these healthcare providers, from patient care to clinical processing to administration and accounting. Due to their smaller operating budgets, community hospitals have limited financial and human resources to operate manual or inefficient information systems. However, these hospitals are expected to achieve the same quality of care and regulatory compliance as larger hospitals, placing 
them in a particularly difficult operating environment. These pressures on the operating environments of community hospitals were increased with the passage of the ARRA in 2009 which, in addition to providing incentives to healthcare providers to achieve meaningful use of EHR, has resulted in lowered Medicare payment levels for healthcare providers that have yet to achieve meaningful use of EHR.
We believe that our acute care IT solutions meet these challenges facing community hospitals by providing fully integrated, enterprise-wide and ARRA-certified medical information systems and services that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). Further, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, TruBridge, TruCode, Get Real Health and HRG, we offer business management, consulting and managed IT services, encoder and patient engagement solutions, along with full RCM solutions, that allow our acute and post-acute care clients to outsource all or just a portion of their business office function. Consulting and other services help clients avoid some of the fixed costs of a business office and leverage our expertise and resources in helping them identify their IT objectives, define the best way to meet those requirements and manage the resulting projects and associated technologies. As a result, we are capable of providing a single-source solution to healthcare organizations, making us a partner in their initiatives to improve operations and medical care.
As a key component to providing complete solutions, we maintain strong partnerships with our clients through a variety of two-way communication channels, including our support teams, role-based user groups, client councils, client work groups, our annual National Client Conference and other organized events and venues that foster insightful and meaningful communication. By listening to our clients and staying abreast of market trends, we strive to provide the right healthcare solutions at the right time to help meet the specific business needs of acute and post-acute care organizations. Our business has continued to grow because we have successfully provided fully integrated, enterprise-wide information systems that allow community hospitals, their physician clinics and skilled nursing facilities to improve operating effectiveness, reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care.

Acute Care Support and Maintenance Services
After EHR installation, we provide software application support, hardware maintenance, continuing education and related services pursuant to a support agreement using our collaborative support model. The following describes services provided to customers using Thrive and Centriq:
• Total System Support. We believe the quality of continuing customer support is one of the most critical considerations in the selection of an information system provider. We provide hardware, technical and software support for all aspects of our system, which gives us the flexibility to take the necessary course of action to resolve any issue. Unlike our competitors who use third-party services for hardware and software support, we provide a single, convenient and efficient resource for all of our customers’ system support needs. In order to minimize the impact of a system problem, we train our customer service personnel to be technically proficient, courteous and prompt. Because a properly functioning information system is crucial to a hospital’s operations, our support teams are available 24 hours per day to assist customers with any problem that may arise. Customers can also use the Internet to directly access our support system. 
• National Client Conference. All of our customers have the opportunity to attend our annual National Client Conference. CPSI hosts this conference to provide our customers educational sessions, product demonstrations, and one-on-one time with application experts. The conference also allows important time for networking among customers and CPSI staff across all business platforms. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our National Client Conference was held virtually in 2020 and 2021. In May 2022, the conference returns to an in-person event.
• Continuing Education. Effective learning tools are a key factor in successful EHR adoption and allowing clients to get the most out of a software investment. Therefore, ongoing learning and training is a cornerstone to our “total solution” and a key competitive differentiator. Our ongoing learning and training offerings also address some of the unique needs of community hospitals - limited resources and staff with cross-department 
responsibilities and budget and time constraints - all of which require a customized approach to learning and training. To meet these needs, Evident offers customers with online content that can be accessed at any time, scheduled online interactive classroom presentations, on-campus training at our facilities in Mobile, Alabama and Minneapolis, Minnesota, educational sessions during user group conferences, and scheduled regional training sessions. 
• Software Releases. We are committed to providing our customers with software and technology solutions that will continue to meet their information system needs. To accomplish this purpose, we continually work to enhance and improve our application programs. As part of this effort, for each customer covered under our general support agreement, we provide software updates as they become available at no additional cost. We design these enhancements to be seamlessly integrated into each customer’s existing system. The benefit of these enhancements is that each customer, regardless of its original installation date, uses the most advanced software available. Through this process, we can keep our customers up-to-date with the latest operational innovations in the healthcare industry as well as with changing governmental regulatory requirements. Another benefit of this "one system" concept is that our customer service teams can be more effective in responding to customer needs because they maintain a complete understanding of and familiarity with the one system that all customers use.
 Purchasing a new information technology system requires the expenditure of a substantial amount of capital and other resources, and many customers are concerned that these systems will become obsolete as technology changes. Our periodic product updates eliminate our customers’ concerns about system obsolescence. We believe providing this benefit is a strong incentive for potential customers to select our products over the products of our competitors.
• Hardware Replacement. As part of our general support agreements, we are also committed to promptly replacing malfunctioning system hardware in order to minimize the effect of operational interruptions. By offering replacements of all hardware used in our system, we believe we are better able to meet and address all of the information technology needs of our customers.
• Cloud Electronic Health Record (Cloud EHR). We offer Cloud EHR services to customers via remote access telecommunications. Cloud EHR is a "Software as a Service" (or "SaaS") configuration and is in essence a subscription to access and use application software maintained by CPSI in a cloud environment for a monthly fee. Under this configuration, a customer is able to obtain access to an advanced EHR without a significant initial capital outlay. We store and maintain all Cloud EHR customers’ critical patient and administrative data using TruBridge Cloud Computing Services. These customers access this information remotely through direct telecommunications connections.
• Forms and Supplies. In addition to our support services, we offer our customers the standard and customized forms that they need for their patient and financial records, as well as the supplies necessary to support the operation of their server and peripheral equipment. Furnishing these forms and supplies helps us to achieve our objective of being a one-source solution for a hospital’s complete healthcare information system requirements.

Software Development 
The healthcare information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to continually make investments to update, enhance and improve our products and services. Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. We capitalize incurred labor costs for software development from the time the preliminary project phase is completed until the software is available for general release. Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred. We estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize its value on a straight-line basis over that estimated life, which is estimated to be five years. If the actual life of the asset is deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the value of the asset may be recorded as a charge to earnings. Amortization begins when the related features are placed in service.
We capitalized software development costs of approximately $9.4 million and $3.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with no such costs capitalized during 2019. In addition, these investments have resulted in total expenditures related to our Product Development Services division of approximately $30.4 million, $33.5 million, and $36.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on software development costs.
Product Management
Through working with our customers and our internal stakeholders, Product Management has successfully identified many meaningful opportunities during 2020 and 2021. These opportunities have been in alignment with our Single Solution product strategy. This strategy creates solutions that are focused on workflows and our users' experiences. We utilize our customer councils (Provider, Nursing, Chief Financial Officer and Client Advisory) to prioritize these workflows. Workflow centric solutions allow us to address the most pressing needs our customers are facing and deliver solutions in a way that minimizes disruption and amplifies adoption. Over the past few years, we have invested in product infrastructure through application programming interfaces ("API") development as well as data normalization efforts. These efforts have been instrumental in development of new products and have allowed us to make significant progress supporting our strategy. These are foundational instruments that accelerate the pace of innovation.
Over the past 18 months, several meaningful partnerships have been established. These partnerships include MediComp, Qliqsoft, MediSolv, Vienna Advantage, Galen Healthcare and NovaRAD. The continued investment in our technology platform is increasing the speed of delivery of new products and creating a marketplace of choice for our customers.
Accessibility, scalability and usability are critical product pillars. The investments in web based user experiences have addressed all three of these pillars. Single Solutions that have been identified and brought to market in 2021 include Communications Center, Thrive Web Client, Patient Connect, Notes, Patient Data Console, 3R and FMS, each of which supports a wide spectrum of user personas and industry specific workflows.
Product Management has introduced a significant initiative to proactively understand user behaviors and product adoption. We are actively implementing a User Analytics platform on all CPSI cloud software platforms to collect and interpret user data into actionable information without added development time in order to continually improve user experiences, influence product roadmaps and provide meaningful insights.
System Implementation and Training
Conversion Services. When a client purchases or leases one of our systems, we convert their existing data to the new system. Our knowledge of hospital data processing, in conjunction with extensive in-house technical expertise, allows us to accomplish this task in a cost effective manner. When we install a new system, the data conversion has already occurred so that the system 
is immediately operational. Our goal is for each client to be productive day one in order to eliminate time and money wasted on the costly and inefficient task of maintaining the same data on parallel systems. Our services also relieve the hospital staff of the time-consuming burden of data conversion. The conversion process is the initial phase of our long-term partnership and overall client experience.
Training. In order to integrate the new system and to ensure its success, we spend approximately sixteen weeks providing individualized training remotely and on-site at the go-live. We provide hardware and software application training for all hospital users, including staff members and healthcare providers, during all hospital shifts. We employ nurses, medical technicians, and providers along with our technical training staff in order to help us communicate more effectively with our clients during the training process. This training phase is also part of the overall client experience that is provided to all of our clients.
Clients, Sales and Marketing
Target Markets
The target market for our acute care EHR systems consists of community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with a primary focus on hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds. In the United States, there are approximately 3,900 community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with approximately 2,900 of these having fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, we market our products to small specialty hospitals in the United States that focus on discrete medical areas such as behavioral health, surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care. Approximately 98% of our existing acute care clients are hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds, while approximately 99% of our existing acute care clients are hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds
The target market for our post-acute care EHR solution consists of approximately 15,500 long-term care and skilled nursing facilities in the United States. In addition, through a strategic relationship with Medtelligent, we are able to market an EHR for assisted living facilities creating add-on sales opportunities in our direct client base and new sales opportunities across the broader senior living market.
The expanded target market for our TruBridge services consists of small to mid-size hospitals in the United States. There are approximately 4,850 of these hospitals with fewer than 500 beds. In addition, we are now marketing our TruBridge services to post-acute care facilities, of which there are approximately 15,500 in the United States. 
Our strategy to grow our TruBridge business is centered around leveraging our established sales relationships within our substantial acute and post-acute EHR base in order to cross sell TruBridge services. In addition, we target hospitals that use competitor EHRs, including upmarket larger hospitals and health systems that manage their RCM operations in-house under increasing financial pressure due to fluctuating patient volumes, increasing self-pay accounts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A core initiative to our growth plan is to maintain a healthy retention rate across our EHR base and pursue conservative growth of new EHR clients, as they are critical to driving cross-sales with TruBridge. To obtain conservative growth of new EHR clients, we (1) target those hospitals under 100 beds in the United States that we believe are currently using a vendor that we have determined is vulnerable based on a variety of factors and (2) target English speaking countries outside the U.S. through active marketing efforts and establishing strategic business relationships. Our goal in the ambulatory market is to aggressively target physician practices in those communities where the local hospital is a current CPSI client.
Our goal in the post-acute care market is to continue to target both individual facilities as well as larger multi-facility corporate entities. In addition, we intend to extend our penetration into the post-acute care market by offering an assisted living facility EHR solution that we believe will broaden the appeal of our solutions to those operators who offer multiple care settings in their organizations.
The following table presents our revenues generated from clients located within the U.S. ("Domestic") and all foreign countries, in total ("International").

Sales Staff
We have dedicated sales organizations in all three business lines: acute care EHR, post-acute care EHR and business management, consulting and managed IT services. Many of our sales personnel are hired from within the Company and have previous experience in client support roles. We believe this experience positions them to more effectively sell our products and services within our target markets. Our sales organizations are generally divided into four areas: sales management, new client sales, existing client sales and sales support staff. New client sales staff are typically organized based on geographic territories, though we also have sales personnel that focus on national accounts in our post-acute care EHR business due to the number of national chain operators in that market. Our sales representatives who sell to existing clients have assigned clients within their territory, which is also geographically based. Some sales representatives in our services areas are assigned specifically to cross-sell services into our acute care EHR and post-acute care EHR client bases. A significant portion of the compensation for all sales personnel except for administrative support staff is commission based.
Marketing Strategy
Our corporate marketing strategy positions CPSI as a healthcare solutions company serving community healthcare organizations through our family of healthcare information technology companies. 
Our EHR software and services address providers across the care continuum, with a primary focus on the community healthcare market. We believe our ability to serve ambulatory, acute and post-acute care settings with our products will be especially appealing as new reimbursement models force the coordination of care by healthcare providers. Our ability to connect patients to care providers within their community and across communities through our own products and interoperability development, including our membership in the CommonWell Health Alliance, sets us apart from other competitors in our market. Our goal is to position ourselves as partners to community healthcare providers as they move to a more proactive care model based on the use of data analytics and patient engagement tools.
With regard to business management, consulting and managed IT services, we will continue to leverage our proven track record of success in accounts receivable management and private pay collections for community healthcare providers. With the increasing complexity of reimbursement requirements and a global shift in healthcare towards an increase in patient financial responsibility, the ability of our services business to bring expertise and best practice operational efficiencies to bear is a significant competitive advantage. In consulting services, the added complexity brought about by the transition to the ICD-10 code set, a standard transaction code set for diagnostic purposes under HIPAA, has created a significant demand for our coding services. Our strategy is to leverage any services engagement, whether business, IT or consulting, into opportunities to cross-sell other services to the client.
Backlog
Backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts. The revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one-time fees for system sales and recurring fees for support and maintenance and TruBridge services. As of December 31, 2021, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $5 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $281 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services. As of December 31, 2020, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $10 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $242 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services.
Competition
The market for our products and services is competitive, and we expect additional competition from established and emerging companies in the future. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, global shifts in the healthcare system, evolving user needs and impactful regulatory and reimbursement changes. We believe the principal competitive factors that hospitals, clinics and post-acute care providers consider when choosing between us and our competitors are:
•product features, functionality and performance;
•range of services offered;
•level of client service and satisfaction;
•ease of integration and speed of implementation;
•product price;
•cost of services offered;
•results of services engagements;
•knowledge of the healthcare industry;
•training provided;
•sales and marketing efforts; and
•company reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on these factors. Our principal competitors in the acute care EHR market are Cerner Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. ("Meditech"), and MEDHOST, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of small and midsize hospitals. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of hospitals in the markets we serve.
Our secondary competitors in the acute care EHR market include Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Epic Systems Corporation. These companies are significantly larger than we are, and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market. However, they will sometimes compete with us directly or, more commonly, when a larger health system who uses a system from one of these companies will offer it to a smaller hospital as part of a merger or alliance. 
We also face competition from providers of practice management systems, general decision support and database systems and other segment-specific applications. Any of these companies as well as other technology or healthcare companies could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market.
Our principal competitors in the post-acute care EHR market are PointClickCare Corporation and MatrixCare, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of long-term post-acute care facilities. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of long-term care providers. 
Our principal competitors in the business management, consulting and managed IT services (which includes the services of recently-acquired HRG) market are Resolution Health, Inc., The Outsource Group Inc., Patient Focus, Inc., Xtend Healthcare Inc., Ensemble Health Partners, and nThrive, Inc. All of these companies provide one or more of the services we offer, with their primary focus being on business management services. The services they offer are comparable in scope to the competing services we offer. These companies all focus on providing services to the healthcare market. Secondary competitors include ARx LLC, Citadel Outsource Group LLC, Patient Matters, LLC, KIWI-TEK, LLC, and Aviacode Inc. Our principle competitors for RCM solutions include RelayHealth Corp, SSI Group, LLC, Quadax Inc., Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc., Availity, LLC, and Navicure, Inc. Get Real Health's primary competitors include Relay Health, Get Well Network/Healthloop, Apollo Care Connect, Bridge Patient Portal, eClinicalWorks Patient Portal, Influence Health, and InteliChart. TruCode's primary competitors include 3M, Nuance and Optum.
Actual or perceived security breaches of our systems could harm the market perception of our products and services which could impact our retention of existing clients and ability to acquire prospective clients.
Health Information Security and Privacy Practices
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") is a federal law governing the use, disclosure, transmission and storage of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as "protected health information," and that was enacted for the purpose of, among other things, protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. As directed by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (the "DHHS") has promulgated standards and rules for certain electronic health transactions, code sets, data security, unique identification numbers and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA and the standards promulgated by DHHS apply to certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as "covered entities"), which includes our hospital and post-acute care clients. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations published in January 2013 (the "HITECH Act") significantly expand HIPAA by extending privacy and security standards to "business associates" of healthcare providers that are covered entities. Under the HITECH Act, business associates are required to establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards and are subject to direct penalties for violations. Certain of our services frequently entail us acting as a healthcare clearinghouse and/or in the capacity of a business associate to the hospitals and post-acute care clients that we serve. As a result, we are covered by the patient privacy and security standards of HIPAA and subject to oversight by DHHS. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to comply with HIPAA, as it applies to us as a business associate, but it is important to note that DHHS could, at any time in the future, adopt new rules or modify existing rules in a manner that could require us to change our systems or operations.
Protecting individually identifiable health information and other sensitive data is a critical and essential function of CPSI’s operations and its software solutions. A variety of industry-standard approaches that meet or exceed regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and HITECH are employed. In order to avoid unauthorized access for the life span of this data, diverse methods of identification, authentication, authorization and encryption are utilized at various points throughout the operating system, application software and hardware. These methods and processes are shared amongst servers and other end-user devices and are complemented by change management processes and tools, which allow the software change control cycle to be a formal, defined process.
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of any personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.
Managing Cybersecurity Risks
Our business operations, including the provision of the products and services described above, involve the compilation and transmission of confidential information, including patient health information. We have included security features in our systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of this information, but our systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors and other similar disruptive problems.
The Board of Directors is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification of, and planning for, the material risks facing the Company, and we believe our policies and procedures are adequate to ensure that relevant information about cybersecurity risks and incidents is appropriately reported and disclosed. During 2020, the Board authorized the formation of an Innovation and Technology Committee comprised of members of the Board. This Committee’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to, more closely monitoring and collaborating with the Company’s Governance, Risk & Compliance (“GRC”) Committee. The purpose of the GRC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to the Company's risk management, ethics programs, and information security/privacy programs. The oversight responsibility of the GRC includes, but is not limited to, planning and conducting audits, conducting investigations, assuring compliance with relevant laws, and ensuring compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and related policies. The GRC consists of a cross functional leadership team including the Chief Technology Officer, Corporate Information Security Officer, Chief Innovation Officer, Senior Vice President of TruBridge, Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate General Counsel, and Chief Financial Officer. 
Additionally, we appointed a Security Operations Center ("SOC") Director to oversee a number of initiatives designed to improve our cybersecurity protection, readiness and response. The Company partnered with a third party to provide Security as a Service ("SECaaS") to assist our internal SOC in reducing the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity attack. The SOC oversees penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, intrusion prevention, endpoint and insider threat detection, log management and other cybersecurity-related projects. The Company consulted with third parties in 2017 and 2018 to conduct an evaluation of our cybersecurity risks. The Company also consulted with third parties to achieve ISO 27001 certification related to information security management, which was achieved during 2020. Finally, all users employed by or contracted to the Company are required to complete annual cybersecurity education and training, which includes identifying suspicious emails, internet threats, telecommunication threats and ransomware.
Although a portion of our workforce has returned to in-office environments following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the successful expansion of work-from-home arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of employee productivity and satisfaction, has resulted in many of these arrangements becoming permanent. As such, we anticipate that our go-forward workforce will be more heavily distributed to remote work environments, and we will continue to focus on not introducing vulnerabilities into our technology systems..
Intellectual Property
We regard some aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely primarily on a combination of contract and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We believe, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our vendors, consultants and clients, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
We do not believe our software products or other CPSI proprietary rights infringe on the property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation.
Material Government Regulations
Our business operations are subject to various federal, state and international laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations.  For example, we are affected by the following regulations:
•As discussed above, the HIPAA security and privacy standards affect our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations, and GDPR is applicable to certain of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU and our operations that are targeting clients and activities within the EU.
•The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has determined that certain of our solutions, such as our ImageLink® product, are medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended.
•The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing and electronic routing of prescriptions via the Surescripts network to pharmacies is governed by federal and state laws.  States have differing regulations that govern the electronic transmission of certain prescriptions and prescription requirements.
Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws, rules and other regulations applicable to our operations, products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate materially increased expenditures in response to government regulations or future material impacts to our results or competitiveness.  These regulations and related risks are described in more detail below under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 25 of this Annual Report.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,000 employees, the substantial majority of which are located at our offices in Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent in order to deliver a one-of-a-kind service and to fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed customer expectations and meet our growth objectives. By improving employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. To that end, we strive to foster an engaged, diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees have equitable opportunities for success.
COVID-19 Response
As the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, so have our processes. In true CPSI spirit, our talented leaders and employees focused their attention on keeping each other, our families, and our clients safe; supporting our clients’ vital missions; and protecting our business. 
CPSI has continued to monitor correspondence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") and other federal and state agencies for developments and updated guidance on COVID-19. While we continue to follow the guidance of public health agencies, CPSI launched an internal employee taskforce to monitor COVID-19 developments. Their focus is to build internal strategies designed to protect our employees and our customers, and to highlight areas of critical importance to support the execution of business outcomes. The taskforce is comprised of cross-functional business leaders that evaluate changing risks and respond appropriately through employee communication design and policy updates.
Out of sincere commitment to and concern for our employees, their families and communities, CPSI took several actions to outwardly display our corporate responsibility for a safe and healthy workforce and to mitigate disruptions to business operations, such as: hosted on-site vaccine clinics for employees and their families, offered paid-time off to receive the COVID-19 vaccinations, held an employee vaccine incentive drawing, and other virtual employee engagement communications.
We are continuing to monitor and address COVID-19’s ongoing effects on our employees and their families, our clients, and the healthcare communities which we support. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, where everyone is inspired to be the best they can be and feels empowered to openly express opinions and ideas that help drive innovation, progress, and excellence. We eagerly promote our relentless commitment to creating an inclusive and respectful culture across our family of companies. We are steadfast in our responsibility to embrace the diversity of all people and demonstrate our values – collaborative, dependable, proactive, empathetic and agile - with an unwavering focus on those essential to the Company achieving sustainable and meaningful growth. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity ("EEO"), as evidenced by the Company’s EEO policy.
As part of our commitment the Company launched our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity Alliance ("Team IDEA") in 2020, an employee-led council with executive sponsorship that is focused on strengthening company-wide engagement on diversity, equity and inclusion, providing learning opportunities for our employees, and helping to identify areas for improvement and monitor progress against these initiatives. In 2021, Team IDEA executed on three initiatives: engaged employees through a series of monthly Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") awareness topics with unique activities to promote a comprehensive employee learning experience, launched a DEI Employee Survey, and deployed policy updates that provide a greater sense of inclusiveness. 
Now, more than ever, we are committed to listening with open hearts and leading with empathy — toward each other, toward our customers and toward our healthcare communities. We continue to invite our people leaders, board, clients, and community leaders, along with our chief people officer, to advise us along this journey. 
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation program is designed to recognize our employees' contributions to service excellence and business results. We use a combination 
of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonus, commissions and merit increases which vary across the Company. In addition, as part of our incentive plan for executives and certain employees, we provide share based compensation to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders. For further information concerning our equity incentive plans, see Note 9, Stock-based Compensation and Equity.
As the success of our employees is fundamentally connected to the well being of our people, our healthcare and benefit programs focus on three key pillars: physical, emotional, and financial well-being. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurances, a 401(K) plan with employer-match, generous time-off, paid maternity leave, identity theft insurance, and financial support. We provide emotional well-being services through our medical carrier and associated Employee Assistance Program. In addition, our financial education tools offer employees resources to reach their personal financial goals.
We continue to partner with our employees to understand how we can better support their health and wellness while allowing them to be their true and authentic selves at work every day.
Development
Our goal is to create opportunities for employee growth, development, education and training, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company. We strive to ensure that we have the right leaders in place to drive our strategic initiatives not only today but also into the future. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees are respected in a culture of belonging and dignity and in which they can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
We also believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our Performance Development Program that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. We encourage managers to solicit and share supportive 360-degree feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success.
Employee Recruitment
Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, vision, products, services and clients, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. As a direct result of the operational COVID-19 pandemic adjustments made to the organization during 2020, the opportunity became available to offer more work from home positions, whereas before, they would have been conducted from within an office space. Leveraging work collaboration tools and other technologies, the ability to hire remote employees has supported our efforts to grow our internal talent and welcome employees from diverse backgrounds and geographies, creating deeper team collaboration and a more engaging client experience. Our recruitment team uses internal and external resources to recruit diverse, highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.
Communication and Engagement
Given the geographic diversity of our workforce, we use multiple modalities in our communication efforts. Our email and the employee hotline have been bolstered by the inclusion of all-employee texting and weekly all-employee communications. Other efforts include live teleconference all-employee meetings hosted by a variety of our leaders. Additionally, leaders participate in monthly business updates that facilitate awareness of business initiatives, progress and results. These meetings encourage cross-functional collaboration and help ensure that teams are not working in silos. These efforts have led to our ability to deliver a more consistent message across all of our constituencies and thereby improve engagement. 
Executive Officers
