Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
Spire Inc. (“Spire”) was formed in 2000 and is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc. (“Spire Missouri”), Spire Alabama Inc. (“Spire Alabama”), other gas utilities, and gas-related businesses. Spire Missouri was formed in 1857 and Spire Alabama was formed in 1948 by the merger of two gas companies. Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth through growing organically, investing in infrastructure, and advancing through innovation. The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing.
 
The Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf Inc. (“Spire Gulf”) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (“Spire Mississippi”) (collectively, the “Utilities”). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri. Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi.
 
The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. (“Spire Marketing”), a wholly owned subsidiary providing natural gas marketing services.
 
As of September 30, 2022, Spire had 3,584 employees, including 2,347 for Spire Missouri and 1,009 for Spire Alabama. We believe that:
 
1. | the safety and well-being of our employees is one of our most important responsibilities,
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | the development, education and advancement of employees is key to our sustainability, and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | embracing an inclusive workforce full of diverse backgrounds and perspectives drives innovation.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to implement processes, procedures and programs that have helped us reduce our employee injury rate for the eighth fiscal year in a row, marking a 21% year-over-year improvement and an overall improvement of 67% since fiscal year 2015. We offer incentives for weight management and gym membership, as well as employee assistance programs to provide counseling services and emotional support, and we have a formalized comprehensive well-being program that focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of every employee.
 
All employees have access to developmental assessments, customized training, specialized degree programs, and partnerships with best-in-class organizations related to industry courses, leadership and management workshops and computer application development seminars. In addition, all employees are eligible for up to $6,000 per year in tuition assistance and have access to the Spire Learning Center, our robust internal learning management system. In their first year, construction and maintenance employees and service employees receive 160–200 hours of technical and safety training. Field operations employees average 40 hours annually of training and Operator Qualification instruction.
 
We regularly review and adjust our affirmative action plans based on placement and utilization rates, and we strive to create an even more diverse and inclusive work environment by committing to and achieving the goals of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge. Our Human Rights Policy demonstrates that Spire understands its universal responsibility to respect human rights and provides the basis for publicly affirming our values and embedding the responsibility into Spire’s operations and the way we do business.

GAS UTILITY
 
Natural Gas Supply
 
The Utilities’ fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities’ primary objectives.
 
Spire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri utilizes Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline LLC (“Spire STL Pipeline”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, may deliver up to 400,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, of which Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 350,000 MMBtu per day. See related discussion under the caption “—The Utilities’ ability to meet their customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner” under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.
 
In fiscal year 2022, Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 24 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service areas included 48.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) through the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star) system, 26.3 Bcf through the Spire STL Pipeline, 26.3 Bcf through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system, 6.3 Bcf through the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, 5.5 Bcf through the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system, and 4.5 Bcf through the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT) system. Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream. Some of Spire Missouri’s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 52.0 Bcf to them through its distribution system.
 
The fiscal year 2022 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 20, 2022. The average temperature was 11 degrees Fahrenheit in both St. Louis and Kansas City. On that day, Spire Missouri’s customers consumed 1.58 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, Missouri Gas Pipeline LLC, Spire STL Pipeline, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri’s on-system storage. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems.
 
Spire Alabama’s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.

Spire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama’s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system’s varying levels of demand.
 
In fiscal 2022, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 27 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which one supplier is under a long-term supply agreement. Approximately 68.2 Bcf was purchased for delivery by Southern Natural Gas, 3.7 Bcf by Transco, and 11.0 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
 
The fiscal 2022 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.5 Bcf on February 14, 2022, when the average temperature was 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100% was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, and intrastate facilities.
 
Spire Gulf’s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier.
 
Natural Gas Storage
 
Spire Missouri believes it currently has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods; however, see related discussion of Spire STL Pipeline under the caption “—The Utilities’ ability to meet their customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner” under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.5 Bcf of gas in MRT’s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star’s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL’s system storage. MRT’s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 1 through November 1 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 4.3 Bcf from November 1 through May 1. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year-round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts.
 
In addition, Spire Missouri supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day, and provides the ability to reinject natural gas during the heating season to replenish or increase deliverability, subject to maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain.
 
Spire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.7 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.5 Bcf of gas with Gulf South Pipeline, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 2.0 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand.
 
Spire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLC’s Bay Gas Storage.
 
Union Agreements
 
The Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Company’s system operations, customer service, results of operations and cash flows.

Regulatory Matters
 
For details on regulatory matters, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.
 
Other Pertinent Matters
 
Spire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install and maintain pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri’s and Spire Alabama’s current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, the Utilities have continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises.
 
The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territories. Direct use of renewables will continue to grow in the future and compete against distributed generation using natural gas.
 
    8 

  

Residential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 94% and 81% of fiscal 2022 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities’ competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications.
 
Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama offer gas transportation service to its large commercial and industrial customers. Transportation customers represent approximately 3% and 15% of fiscal 2022 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. The Spire Missouri tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which Spire Missouri would have received under their regular sales rates. Similarly, Spire Alabama’s tariff is based on Spire Alabama’s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected.
 
The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities’ or the Company’s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.
 
GAS MARKETING
 
Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related services throughout the United States, which includes customers within and outside of the Utilities’ service areas. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, Spire Marketing volumes averaged 1.73 Bcf/day and 2.02 Bcf/day, respectively. The majority of Spire Marketing’s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities.
 
In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from pipeline companies directly and from other parties through the secondary capacity market. Throughout fiscal 2022, Spire Marketing held approximately 1.1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2022, Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 28.2 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2022-2023 winter season.
