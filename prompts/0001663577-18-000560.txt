Item 1. Business 
Our Business
 
We develop chewing gums to deliver nutraceutical/functional ingredients for applications such as appetite suppressant, cholesterol suppressant, vitamin delivery, antioxidant delivery and motion sickness suppressant.
 
Our plan is to market nutraceutical/functional chewing gum and in the future medicinal chewing gum. We are researching new ways to use chewing gum as a delivery system, expanding on the kinds of applications chewing gum has been used for in the past. We expected to reveal functional chewing gum for new applications by the end of 2014, but were not able to do so. We first need to raise additional capital to develop our chewing gum to deliver medicines.
 
Our mission is to improve the health and quality of life for millions of people all over the world who are unable to or have difficulty with swallowing tablets. As much as 40% of the adult population in America and an even greater percentage of the adolescent population have difficulties swallowing pills, and we believe our solutions will benefit them.
 
Presently, we are focused on nutrition and health chewing gum with natural based ingredients. The products below are currently under development and we are working to file patents to protect the ingredients in these products.

Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to sell our product, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as licensing requirements, income taxes, and payroll taxes. 
Employees
 
We have no other employees other than our officers and directors. They oversee all responsibilities in corporate administration, business development and research. If finances permit, however, we intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2008 under the name “Jedediah Resources Corp.” We are a development stage company.
 
After our formation, we were in the business of mineral exploration. On May 3, 2010, however, we entered into two agreements with Ola S. Juvkam-Wold (“Juvkam-Wold”), who was then our Chief Executive Officer and a director of our company: a Stock Purchase Agreement and General Release and Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Juvkam-Wold agreed to cancel and return 55,000,000 shares of common stock owned by him to us for all of the issued and outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary, JRE Exploration Ltd. (“JRE”), and the cancellation of all debt owed by JRE to us. Pursuant to the Release and Settlement, Mr. Juvkam-Wold released us from any and all claims Mr. Juvkam-Wold may have against us or our affiliates. Our mineral exploration business was housed in JRE, and the transaction jettisoned the business from our company. Mr. Juvkam-Wold resigned as our officer and director and Soren Nielson took his place.
 
On May 3, 2010, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (“IP Agreement”) with Soren Nielsen pursuant to which Mr. Nielsen transferred his right, title and interest in all intellectual property relating to certain chewing gum compositions having appetite suppressant activity (the “IP”) to us for 55,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. Following the acquisition of the IP we changed our business direction and, during the quarterly period covered by this report, were pursuing the development of chewing gums for the delivery of Nutraceutical/functional ingredients for applications such as appetite suppressant, cholesterol suppressant, vitamin delivery, antioxidant delivery and motion sickness suppressant.
 
On July 9, 2010, we changed our name from “Jedediah Resources Corp.” to “Alterola Biotech Inc,” increased our authorized common stock to 140,000,000 shares and conducted a forward split of 10 for 1 of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
On April 10, 2017, we entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets (the “Agreement”) with our prior officer and director, Rene Lauritsen. Pursuant to the Agreement, we transferred all assets related to our nutraceutical chewing gum business to Mr. Lauritsen. In exchange for this assignment of assets, Mr. Lauritsen returned his 37,000,000 shares for cancellation. 
 
Prior to resigning, Mr Lauritsen appointed Micahel Freitag as our sole officer and director and we agreed to compensate him with 37,000,000 shares of our common stock for his first six months of service.

As of April 10, 2017, we intended to raise further capital, bring all public filings current and set about a new business direction based around a novel therapy and the intellectual property generated from our research and development activities on ethanol based intoxication.
 
Subsequently, on March 26, 2018, Mr. Freitag sold his control shares along with another shareholder, Krono Partners Limited, to London Pharma Holdings Limited for $200,000. This resulted in a change of control. 
 
Also on March 26, 2018, Mr. Freitag resigned from his official positions as Director and CEO of the Company, and on the same day the shareholders of the Corporation voted Mr. Peter Maddocks as Director, and CEO.
 
On June 21, 2018, we signed an escrow agreement with Mr. Lauritsen to serve as our Chief Operating Officer and to contribute the IP for the company’s chewing gum business. In that agreement, we agreed to enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Lauritsen and to pay him a salary of $7,500 per month. For the IP, we agreed to compensate Mr. Lauritsen with 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and cash of $75,000. Neither the employment agreement nor the IP transfer agreement have been executed as of the date of this report.
