Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a shock wave technology company using a patented system of noninvasive, high-energy, acoustic shock waves for regenerative medicine and other applications. Our initial focus is regenerative medicine utilizing noninvasive, acoustic shock waves to produce a biological response resulting in the body healing itself through the repair and regeneration of tissue, musculoskeletal, and vascular structures.
 
Our lead regenerative product in the United States is the dermaPACE® device, used for treating diabetic foot ulcers, which was subject to two double-blinded, randomized Phase III clinical studies. On December 28, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) granted the Company’s request to classify the dermaPACE® System as a Class II device via the de novo process. As a result of this decision, the Company was able to immediately market the product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers as described in the de novo request, subject to the general control provisions of the FD&C Act and the special controls identified in this order.
 
Our portfolio of healthcare products and product candidates activate biologic signaling and angiogenic responses, including new vascularization and microcirculatory improvement, helping to restore the body’s normal healing processes and regeneration. We intend to apply our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE®) technology in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions. The Company is marketing its dermaPACE® System for treatment usage in the United States and will continue to generate revenue from sales of the European Conformity Marking (CE Mark) devices and accessories in Europe, Canada, Asia, Brazil, Mexico, and Asia/Pacific. The Company generates revenue streams from dermaPACE® treatments, product sales, licensing transactions and other activities, and with its recent acquisition of the UltraMIST® assets, SANUWAVE now combines two highly complementary and market-cleared energy transfer technologies used in the dermaPACE® and UltraMIST® Systems and two human tissue biologic products (Biovance® and Interfyl®), creating a platform of scale with an end-to-end product offering in the advanced wound care market.
 
Our lead product candidate for the global wound care market, dermaPACE®, has received FDA clearance for commercial use to treat diabetic foot ulcers in the United States and the CE Mark allowing for commercial use on acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue. We believe we have demonstrated that our patented technology is safe and effective in stimulating healing in chronic conditions of the foot and the elbow through our United States FDA Class III Premarket Approvals (“PMAs”) approved OssaTron® device, and in the stimulation of bone and chronic tendonitis regeneration in the musculoskeletal environment through the utilization of our OssaTron, Evotron®, and orthoPACE® devices in Europe and Asia.
 
We are focused on developing our PACE technology to activate healing in:
 

(1) | wound conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers, venous and arterial ulcers, pressure sores, burns and other skin eruption conditions;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | orthopedic applications, such as eliminating chronic pain in joints from trauma, arthritis or tendons/ligaments inflammation, speeding the healing of fractures (including nonunion or delayed-union conditions), improving bone density in osteoporosis, fusing bones in the extremities and spine, and other potential sports injury applications; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | plastic/cosmetic applications such as cellulite smoothing, graft and transplant acceptance, skin tightening, scarring and other potential aesthetic uses; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | cardiac applications for removing plaque due to atherosclerosis improving heart muscle performance.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to healthcare uses, our high-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves, due to their powerful pressure gradients and localized cavitational effects, may have applications in secondary and tertiary oil exploitation, for cleaning industrial waters and food liquids and finally for maintenance of industrial installations by disrupting biofilms formation. Our business approach will be through licensing and/or partnership opportunities.
 


 
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which is likely to decrease demand for a broad variety of products, including from our customers. We have experienced a disruption of our supply channels which will continue for an unknown period of time until the global supply chain can return to the  pre- disease status. Also, the pandemic may cause continued or additional actions by hospitals and clinics such as limiting elective procedures and treatments and limiting clinical trial activities and data monitoring. These factors have had and we expect that they will continue to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict.
 
Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) Technology for Regenerative Medicine
 
Our PACE product candidates, including our lead product candidate, dermaPACE®, deliver high-energy acoustic pressure waves in the shock wave spectrum to produce compressive and tensile stresses on cells and tissue structures. These mechanical stresses at the cellular level have been shown in pre-clinical work to promote angiogenic and positive inflammatory responses, and quickly initiate the healing cascade. This has been shown in pre-clinical work to result in microcirculatory improvement, including increased perfusion and blood vessel widening (arteriogenesis), the production of angiogenic growth factors, enhanced new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and the subsequent regeneration of tissue such as skin, musculoskeletal and vascular structures. PACE procedures trigger the initiation of an accelerated inflammatory response that speeds wounds into proliferation phases of healing and subsequently returns a chronic condition to an acute condition to help reinitiate the body’s own healing response. We believe that our PACE technology is well suited for various applications due to its activation of a broad spectrum of cellular events critical for the initiation and progression of healing.
 
High-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves are the primary component of our previously developed product, OssaTron, which was approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States for use in chronic plantar fasciitis of the foot in 2000 and for elbow tendonitis in 2003. Previously, acoustic pressure shock waves have been used safely at much higher energy and pulse levels in the lithotripsy procedure (breaking up kidney stones) by urologists for over 25 years and has reached the care status of “golden standard” for the treatment of kidney stones.
 
We research, design, manufacture, market and service our products worldwide and believe we have already demonstrated that our technology is safe and effective in stimulating healing in chronic musculoskeletal conditions of the foot and the elbow through our United States FDA Class III PMA approved OssaTron device, and in the stimulation of bone and chronic tendonitis regeneration in the musculoskeletal environment through the utilization of our orthoPACE, Evotron and OssaTron devices in Europe, Asia and Asia/Pacific.
 
We believe our experience from our preclinical research and the clinical use of our predecessor legacy devices in Europe and Asia, as well as our OssaTron device in the United States, demonstrates the safety, clinical utility and efficacy of these products. In addition, we have preclinical programs focused on the development and better understanding of treatments specific to our target applications.
 
Currently, there are limited biological or mechanical therapies available to activate the healing and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue and vascular structures. As baby boomers age, the incidence of their targeted diseases and musculoskeletal injuries and ailments will be far more prevalent. We believe that our pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that our PACE technology will be effective in targeted applications. We anticipate that future clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the Americas, Middle East and Africa. If approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, we believe that our product candidates will offer new, effective and noninvasive (extracorporeal) treatment options in wound healing, orthopedic injuries, plastic/cosmetic uses and cardiovascular procedures, improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from injuries or deterioration of tissue, bones and vascular structures.
 
dermaPACE® – Our Lead Product Candidate
 
The FDA granted approval of our Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to conduct two double-blinded, randomized clinical trials utilizing our lead device product for the global wound care market, the dermaPACE® device, in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
 


 
The dermaPACE® system was evaluated using two studies under IDE G070103. The studies were designed as prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled, multi-center 24-week studies at 39 centers. A total of 336 subjects were enrolled and treated with either dermaPACE® plus conventional therapy or conventional therapy (a.k.a. standard of care) alone. Conventional therapy included, but was not limited to, debridement, saline-moistened gauze, and pressure reducing footwear. The objective of the studies was to compare the safety and efficacy of the dermaPACE® device to sham-control application. The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint for the dermaPACE® studies was the incidence of complete wound closure at 12 weeks post-initial application of the dermaPACE® system (active or sham). Complete wound closure was defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements, confirmed over two consecutive visits within 12-weeks. If the wound was considered closed for the first time at the 12-week visit, then the next visit was used to confirm closure. Investigators continued to follow subjects and evaluate wound closure through 24 weeks.
 
Between the two studies there were over 336 patients evaluated, with 172 patients treated with dermaPACE® and 164 control group subjects with use of a non-functional device (sham). Both treatment groups received wound care consistent with the standard of care in addition to device application. Study subjects were enrolled using pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to obtain a homogenous study population with chronic diabetes and a diabetic foot ulcer that has persisted a minimum of 30 days and its area is between 1cm2 and 16cm2, inclusive. Subjects were enrolled at Visit 1 and followed for a run-in period of two weeks. At two weeks (Visit 2 – Day 0), the first treatment was applied (either dermaPACE® or Sham Control application). Applications with either dermaPACE® or Sham Control were then made at Day 3 (Visit 3), Day 6 (Visit 4), and Day 9 (Visit 5) with the potential for 4 additional treatments in Study 2. Subject progress including wound size was then observed on a bi-weekly basis for up to 24 weeks at a total of 12 visits (Weeks 2-24; Visits 6-17).
 
We retained Musculoskeletal Clinical Regulatory Advisers, LLC (MCRA) in January 2015 to lead the Company’s interactions and correspondence with the FDA for the dermaPACE®, which have already commenced. MCRA has successfully worked with the FDA on numerous Premarket Approvals (PMAs) for various musculoskeletal, restorative and general surgical devices since 2006.
 
Working with MCRA, we submitted to FDA a de novo petition on July 23, 2016. Due to the strong safety profile of our device and the efficacy of the data showing statistical significance for wound closure for dermaPACE® subjects at 20 weeks, we believe that the dermaPACE® device should be considered for classification into Class II as there is no legally marketed predicate device and there is not an existing Class III classification regulation or one or more approved PMAs (which would have required a reclassification under Section 513(e) or (f)(3) of the FD&C Act). On December 28, 2017, the FDA determined that the criteria at section 513(a)(1)(A) of (B) of the FD&C Act were met and granted the de novo clearance classifying dermaPACE® as Class II and available to be marketed immediately.
 
Finally, our dermaPACE® device has received the European CE Mark approval to treat acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue, such as in the treatment of pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and traumatic and surgical wounds. The dermaPACE® is also licensed for sale in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Additionally, our joint venture partner in Brazil, Diversa SA, received approval from the Brazilian Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (“National Health Surveillance Agency” or “ANVISA”) to market dermaPACE® to treat diabetic foot ulcers in Brazil.
 
We are actively marketing the dermaPACE® to the European Community, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Asia/Pacific, utilizing distributors in select countries.
 
Clinical Studies
 
A post-market pilot study to evaluate the effects of high energy focused, acoustic shock wave therapy on local skin perfusion and healing of diabetic foot ulcers was changed to a 15-patient case study with the same primary objective of determining the effects of high-energy focused, acoustic shock wave therapy on oxygen saturation levels was completed. A near-infrared spectroscopy device was used to measure the oxygen saturation levels prior to treatment and after the full treatment regimen. Treatment with the dermaPACE® System resulted in all patients demonstrating a statistically significant increase in tissue oxygen saturation within the wound bed, a key component of wound healing. Additionally, the results showed all 15 wounds demonstrated a decrease in wound area and seven of the wounds healed. The results of this case study are another indication that treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers with the dermaPACE® System prepares the wound bed via oxygenation and neo-vascularization, facilitating accelerated wound resolution via the body’s natural healing process or preparing the wound to more readily respond to other advanced healing modalities.
 


 
UltraMIST® - Ultra sound healing Therapy
 
UltraMIST® is an FDA approved powerful, non-contact and non-thermal ultrasound therapy device used to promote wound healing. UltraMIST® is FDA approved to treat malaises such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers, deep tissue pressure injuries, and surgical wounds. Currently, the Company’s dermaPACE® is only approved to treat diabetic foot ulcer.
 
UltraMIST® currently has over 900 customers in 46 states providing the Company with a robust product offering in the advanced wound care market and an end-to-end advanced wound care product portfolio that addresses the entire care pathway.
 
Biologic Products
 
BIOVANCE is a graft skin substitute product that provides a natural foundation for wound healing. The product is an allograft that is prepared from the amnion, the part of the amniotic sac closest to the developing embryo. Key cells and proteins move into the BIOVANCE material so that tissues can regenerate, and wounds can continue to heal. The product is adaptable and flexible, it can conform to irregular surfaces. It is also adaptable in that it can be sutured or glued if determined by the clinician to be a better option. The product also has a 5-year shelf life at room temperature conditions and is available in multiple sizes for application flexibility.
Interfyl is a liquid product that replaces damaged integumental soft tissue and augments / supplements inadequate connective tissues. Interfyl is comprised of allogenic decellularized particulate human placental connective tissue matrix that is placed on a wound. The product repairs small surgical defects resulting from either medical or surgical conditions, including patients with exposed vital structures such as bone, tendon, ligament, or nerves. Interfyl has the ability to fill irregular spaces or soft tissue deficits resulting from trauma or surgery. The filler also allows for cell adherence and growth during tissue repair and affords structural support and elasticity in the tissue. The product is offered in a 1.5mL flowable format in a 3-mL syringe. 50mg and 100mg particulates are in each vial.
Growth Opportunity in Wound Care Treatment
 
We are focused on the development of products that treat unmet medical needs in large market opportunities. Our FDA approval in the United States for our lead product candidate, dermaPACE®, is the first step in providing an option to a currently unmet need in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetes is common, disabling and deadly. In the United States, diabetes has reached epidemic proportions. Based on our research, foot ulcerations are one of the leading causes of hospitalization in diabetic patients and lead to billions of dollars in health care expenditures annually. According to a 2020 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on estimated 2018 data, approximately 34.1 million people aged 18 years or older (diagnosed and undiagnosed), roughly 13.0% of the United States population, have diabetes and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 18 years or older. In 2016, there were 7.8 million hospital discharges with diabetes as a listed diagnosis. The estimated total direct and indirect costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2017 was $327 billion. Between 2012 and 2017, medical costs per person associated with diabetes increased from $8,417 to $9,601. Approximately 2 - 7% of diabetics will develop a diabetic foot ulcer each year. Foot ulcers are a significant complication of diabetes mellitus and often precede lower-extremity amputation. The most frequent underlying etiologies are neuropathy, trauma, deformity, high plantar pressures, and peripheral arterial disease. Over 50% of Diabetic foot ulcers will become infected, resulting in high rates of hospitalization, increased morbidity and potential lower extremity amputation and up to 80% of Diabetic foot ulcers that have healed will re-ulcerate within 12 months. According to the International Diabetes Federation 2019 Global Fact Sheet, approximately 463 million people has diabetes and 10% of global health expenditure is spent on diabetes (approximately $760 billion).
 
A majority of challenging wounds are non-healing chronic wounds and in addition, chronic diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers are often slow-to-heal wounds, which often fail to heal for many months, and sometimes, for several years. These wounds often involve physiologic, complex and multiple complications such as reduced blood supply, compromised lymphatic systems or immune deficiencies that interfere with the body’s normal wound healing processes. These wounds often develop due to a patient’s impaired vascular and tissue repair capabilities. Wounds that are difficult to treat do not always respond to traditional therapies, which include hydrocolloids, hydrogels and alginates, among other treatments. We believe that physicians and hospitals need a therapy that addresses the special needs of these chronic wounds with high levels of both clinical and cost effectiveness.
 


 
We believe we are developing a safe and advanced technology in the wound healing and tissue regeneration market with PACE. dermaPACE® is noninvasive and does not require anesthesia, making it a cost-effective, time-efficient and painless approach to wound care. Physicians and nurses look for therapies that can accelerate the healing process and overcome the obstacles of patients’ compromised conditions and prefer therapies that are easy to administer. In addition, since many of these patients are not confined to bed, healthcare providers want therapies that are minimally disruptive to the patient’s or the caregiver’s daily routines. dermaPACE’s noninvasive treatments are designed to elicit the body’s own healing response and, followed by simple standard of care dressing changes, are designed to allow for limited disruption to the patients’ normal lives and have no effect on mobility while their wounds heal.
 
Developing Product Opportunities - Orthopedic
 
The orthoPACE System, which is intended for use in orthopedic, trauma and sports medicine indications, continues to be a viable and effective treatment solution in Europe and South Korea. The device features four types of applicators including a unique applicator that is less painful for some indications and may reduce or completely eliminate anesthesia for some patients. In the orthopedic setting, the orthoPACE System is being used to treat tendinopathies and acute and nonunion fractures, including the soft tissue surrounding the fracture to accelerate healing and prevent secondary complications and their associated treatment costs
 
We believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic market, driven by aging baby boomers and their desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to musculoskeletal tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries.
 
We have experience in the sports medicine field (which generally refers to the non-surgical and surgical management of cartilage, ligament and tendon injuries) through our legacy devices, OssaTron and Evotron. Common examples of these injuries include extremity joint pain, torn rotator cuffs (shoulder), tennis elbow, Achilles’ tendon tears and torn meniscus cartilage in the knee. Injuries to these structures are very difficult to treat because the body has a limited natural ability to regenerate these kinds of tissues. Cartilage, ligament and tendons seldom return to a pre-injury state of function. Due to a lack of therapies that can activate healing and regenerate these tissues, many of these injuries will result in a degree of permanent impairment and chronic pain. Prior investigations and pre-clinical work indicate that PACE can positively affect the body’s inflammatory process and activate various cell types and may be an important adjunct to the management of sports medicine injuries. We plan to submit to U.S. FDA a 510(k) seeking clearance for general indications to address this growing field.
 
Additionally, we have developed and introduced Profile by SANUWAVE as an immediately available solution for pain management in sports medicine and physical therapy in the U.S. market. Profile by SANUWAVE is a therapeutic massager intended for the relief of minor muscle aches and pains via SANUWAVE’s Diffused Acoustic Pressure (DAP®) technology. DAP® delivers the beneficial, therapeutic field of the acoustic pressure waves without the impact and potential pain of a focused pulse. There is a significant need in the U.S. for pain management products and the non-invasive delivery of therapeutic shockwaves for its treatment can help to serve this market.
 
Non-Medical Uses for Our Shockwave Technology
 
We believe there are significant license/partnership opportunities for our acoustic pressure shockwave technology in non-medical uses, including in the energy, water, food, and industrial markets.
 

Due to their powerful pressure gradients and localized cavitational effects, we believe that high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves can be used to clean, in an energy efficient manner, contaminated fluids from impurities, bacteria, viruses, and other harmful micro-organisms, which provides opportunities for our technology in cleaning industrial and domestic/municipal waters. Based on the same principles of action of the acoustic pressure shockwaves against bacteria, viruses, and harmful micro-organisms, we believe our technology can be applied for cleaning or sterilization of various foods such as milk, natural juices, and meats.
 


 
In the energy sector, we believe that the acoustic pressure shockwaves can be used to improve oil recovery (IOR), as a supplement to or in conjunction with existing fracking technology, which utilizes high pressurized water/gases to crack the rocks that trapped oil in the underground reservoir. Through the use of our high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves the efficiency can be improved and at the same time the environmental impact of the fracking process can be reduced. Furthermore, we believe our technology can be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) based on the changes in oil flow characteristics resulting from acoustic pressure shockwave stimulation, as a tertiary method of oil recovery from older oil fields.
 
Additionally, we demonstrated through three studies performed at Montana State University that high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves are disrupting biofilms and thus can be used for surface cleaning monuments, ship hulls, and underwater structure cleaning, or to unclog pipes in the energy industry (shore or off-shore installations), food industry, and water management industry, which will reduce or eliminate down times with significant financial benefits for maintenance of existing infrastructure. Also, our technology should have a significant environmental impact by eliminating or reducing the use of harmful chemicals, which are the preferred biofilm cleaning method at this time.
 
Market Trends
 
We are focused on the development of regenerative medicine products that have the potential to address substantial unmet clinical needs across broad market indications. We believe there are limited therapeutic treatments currently available that directly and reproducibly activate healing processes in the areas in which we are focusing, particularly for wound care and repair of certain types of musculoskeletal conditions.
 
According to AdvaMed and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data from 2006 and our internal projections, the United States advanced wound healing market for the dermaPACE® is estimated at $20 billion, which includes diabetic foot ulcers, pressure sores, burns and traumatic wounds, and chronic mixed leg ulcers. We also believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic and spine markets, driven by aging baby boomers and their desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to orthopedic tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries.
 
With the success of negative pressure wound therapy devices in the wound care market over the last decade and the recognition of the global epidemic associated with certain types of wounds, as well as deteriorating musculoskeletal conditions attributed to obesity, diabetes, vascular and heart disease, as well as sports injuries, we believe that Medicare and private insurers have become aware of the high costs and expenditures associated with the adjunctive therapies being utilized for wound healing and orthopedic conditions that have limited efficacies in full skin closure, or bone and tissue regeneration. We believe the wound healing and orthopedic markets are undergoing a transition, and market participants are interested in biological response activating devices that are applied noninvasively and seek to activate the body’s own capabilities for regeneration of tissue at injury sites in a cost-effective manner.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is focused on the research, development, and commercialization of our patented, non-invasive and biological response-activating medical systems for the repair and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures. Our end-to-end wound care portfolio of regenerative medicine products and product candidates help restore the body’s normal healing processes. SANUWAVE applies and researches its patented energy transfer technologies in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic, and cardiac/endovascular conditions.
 
Through our August 2020 acquisition of the UltraMIST® System, we now combine two highly complementary and market-cleared energy transfer technologies used in the dermaPACE® and UltraMIST® medical device Systems, which creates a platform of scale in the advanced wound care market.
 
Our the dermaPACE® device for treating diabetic foot ulcers, which was subject to two double-blinded, randomized Phase III clinical studies. On December 28, 2017, the U.S. FDA granted the Company’s request to classify the dermaPACE® System as a Class II device via the de novo process. As a result of this decision, the Company was able to immediately market the product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers as described in the de novo request, subject to the general control provisions of the FD&C Act and the special controls identified in this order.
 


 
Our portfolio of healthcare products and product candidates activate biologic signaling and angiogenic responses, including new vascularization and microcirculatory improvement, helping to restore the body’s normal healing processes and regeneration. We intend to apply our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) technology in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions.
 
Our immediate goal for our regenerative medicine technology involves leveraging the knowledge we gained from our existing human heel and elbow indications to enter the advanced wound care market with innovative treatments.
 
The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 

• | Commercialize and support the domestic distribution of our dermaPACE® device to treat diabetic foot ulcers.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Following FDA approval in December 2017, we sought a development and/or commercialization partnership, or to commercialize the product ourselves domestically, including the commercialization of the assets obtained in the Asset Purchase Agreement with our internal sales force. Outside the United States, we retain distributors to represent our products in selective international markets. These distributors have been selected based on their existing business relationships and the ability of their sales force and distribution capabilities to effectively penetrate the market with our PACE product line. We rely on these distributors to manage physical distribution, customer service and billing services for our international customers.
 
For a period of approximately three months following the August 6, 2020 Asset Purchase Agreement, we utilized the seller to fulfill certain customer orders and to collect related accounts receivable payments from customer orders that originated from the acquired business after August 6, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, orders fulfilled by the seller comprised approximately 41% of the Company’s 2020 full year revenues. As of December 31, 2020, accounts receivable balances that originated from these seller-fulfilled orders constituted approximately 46% of accounts receivable balances, all of which were either reserved as of December 31, 2020 or subsequently collected during 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, orders fulfilled by the seller comprised approximately 16% of the accounts receivable balances, and one other vendor comprised approximately 24% of the accounts receivable balances.

In addition, if we do not avoid infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, we may have to seek a license to sell our products, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of intellectual property in court. Any current or future challenges to our patent rights, or challenges by us to the patent rights of others, could be expensive and time consuming.
 
We derive our patent rights, including as to both issued patents and “patent pending” applications, from three sources: (1) assignee of patent rights in technology we developed; (2) assignee of patent rights purchased from HealthTronics, Inc. (“HealthTronics”); and (3) as licensee of certain patent rights assigned to HealthTronics. In August 2005, we purchased a significant number of patents and patent applications from HealthTronics, to whom we granted back perpetual and royalty-free field-of-use license rights in the purchased patent portfolio primarily for urological uses. We believe that our owned and licensed patent rights provide a competitive advantage with respect to others that might seek to utilize certain of our apparatuses and methods incorporating extracorporeal acoustic pressure shockwave technologies that we have patented. However, we do not hold patent rights that cover all of our products, product components, or methods that utilize our products. We also have not conducted a competitive analysis or valuation with respect to our issued and pending patent portfolio in relation to our current products and/or competitor products.
 
On the shockwave technology, we are the assignee of thirty-four (34) issued United States patents and forty-seven (47) issued foreign patents that are not expired, which on average have remaining useful lives of ten years with the longest useful life extending to 2039. On the ultrasound technology, we are the assignee of seventeen (17) issued United States patents and twenty-three (23) issued foreign patents that are not expired, which on average have remaining useful life extending to 2028.  Our current issued United States and foreign patents include patent claims directed to particular electrode configurations for shockwave devices, piezoelectric fiber shockwave devices, chemical components for shockwave generation, reflector geometries for focused shockwaves, general medical systems general construction, non-contact and low-frequency ultrasound device construction, disposable applicator for ultrasound devices, ultrasonic catheter for drug delivery, ultrasonic method for wound treatment, combination of ultrasound and laser in wound care, and software architecture for licensing processes. Our United States patents also include patent claims directed to methods and devices such as our products for using acoustic pressure shockwaves or non-contact and low frequency ultrasound to treat ischemic conditions, spinal cord scar tissue and spinal injuries, bone fractures and osteoporosis, blood sterilization, stem cell stimulation, tissue cleaning, and within particular treatment parameters using personalized medical treatments for diabetic foot ulcers or pressure sores or venous ulcers or arterial ulcers or acute skin conditions. Also, we have a significant number of US and international patents related to the extracorporeal or intracorporeal use of shockwaves or pressure waves for cardiovascular field (plaque removal, elimination of occlusions, treatment of heart tissue ischemia, to name a few). While such patented method and device claims may provide patent protection against certain indirect infringing promotion and sales activities of competing manufacturers and distributors, certain medical methods performed by medical practitioners or related health care entities or methods executed by industrial operators may be subject to exemption from potential infringement claims under 35 U.S.C. § 287(c) and, therefore, may limit enforcement of claims of our medical and non-medical method patents as compared to device construction patents.
 


 
We also currently maintain for shockwave technology twelve (12) United States patent applications and nineteen (19) foreign patent applications. Our patent-pending rights include inventions directed to certain shockwave devices and systems, ancillary products, and components for acoustic pressure shockwave treatment devices, and various methods of using acoustic pressure shockwaves in both medical and non-medical applications. The medical patent-pending methods include, for example, using acoustic pressure shockwaves to treat soft tissue disorders, bones, joints, wounds, skin, blood vessels, lymphatic disorders, cardiac tissue, fat and cellulite, lung tissue, or to facilitate vaccination, or to disinfect reusable devices as ventilators and endoscopes, and for the use of shockwaves in combination with other energy medical technologies. In the non-medical field, the use of acoustic pressure shockwaves for blood and fluids sterilization, to facilitate oil extraction and processing, to destroy different pathogens from installation and different devices, to process fluids, meat and dairy products, to achieve desalination and decontamination of radio-active waters, and to clean transport pipes.
 For the ultrasound technology, we currently maintain two (2) United States patent applications and eight (8) foreign patent applications.  Our patent-pending rights include inventions directed to non-contact and low-frequency ultrasound systems and methods for delivering cellular and biological materials to tissues and new designs used to deliver ultrasonic therapies to wound care.
 All our United States and foreign pending applications either have yet to be examined or require response to an examiner’s office action rejections and, therefore, remain subject to further prosecution, the possibility of further rejections and appeals, and/or the possibility we may elect to abandon prosecution, without assurance that a patent may issue from any pending application.
 
Under our license to HealthTronics, we reserve exclusive rights in our purchased portfolio as to orthopedic, tendonopathy, skin wounds, cardiac, dental, neural medical conditions and to all conditions in animals (Ortho Field). HealthTronics receives field-exclusive and sublicensable rights under the purchased portfolio as to (1) certain HealthTronics lithotripsy devices in all fields other than the Ortho Field, and (2) all products in the treatment of renal, ureteral, gall stones and other urological conditions (Litho Field). HealthTronics also receives non-exclusive and non-sublicensable rights in the purchased portfolio as to any products in all fields other than the Ortho Field and Litho Field. Refer to section “Contractual Obligations” for information on the default of our loan with HealthTronics.
 
Pursuant to mutual amendment and other assignment-back rights under the patent license agreement with HealthTronics, we are also a licensee of certain patents and patent applications that have been assigned to HealthTronics. We received a perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free license to nine issued foreign patents. Our non-exclusive license is subject to HealthTronics’ sole discretion to further maintain any of the patents and pending applications assigned back to HealthTronics.
 
As part of the sale of the veterinary business in June 2009, we have also granted certain exclusive and non-exclusive patent license rights to Pulse Veterinary Technologies, LLC for most of our medical patent portfolio issued before 2009 to utilize acoustic pressure shockwave technologies in the field of non-human mammals.
 
Given our international patent portfolio, there are growing risks of challenges to our existing and future patent rights. Such challenges may result in invalidation or modification of some or all of our patent rights in a particular patent territory and reduce our competitive advantage with respect to third party products and services. Such challenges may also require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
 
If we become involved in future litigation or any other adverse intellectual property proceeding, for example, as a result of an alleged infringement, or a third party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, including treble damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation or lengthy governmental proceedings and could divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous, if available at all.
 


 
Trademarks
 
Since other products on the market compete with our products, we believe that our product brand names are an important factor in establishing and maintaining brand recognition.
We have the following trademark registrations: SANUWAVE® (United States, European Community, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Taiwan and under the Madrid Protocol), dermaPACE® (United States, European Community, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, China, Brazil, Mexico, and under the Madrid Protocol), angioPACE® (European Community and United Kingdom), PACE® - Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (United States, European Community, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Canada), orthoPACE® (United States, United Kingdom, and European Community), DAP® - Diffused Acoustic Pressure (United States and European Community), and Profile® (United States, European Community, and United Kingdom). Our newest trademark is Energy First® (United States), Healing Today, Curing Tomorrow® (United States), and UltraMIST® (United States).
 
Through the acquisition of UltraMIST®/MIST assets from Celularity, now SANUWAVE is the owner of the Celleration® (United States, Australia, Europe Community, and Japan), Proven Healing® (Madrid Protocol, European Community, and United Kingdom), MIST Ultrasound Healing Therapy & Design® (United States), MIST® (United States), MIST Therapy® (United States), and MIST & Design® (United States) registered trademarks.
 
We also maintain trademark registrations for: OssaTron® (United States), OSWT® (Switzerland) Evotron® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Evotrode® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Orthotripsy® (United States). We phased out the OssaTrode® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Equitron® (United States and Switzerland). Reflectron® (Germany and Switzerland) and Reflectrode® (Germany and Switzerland), evoPACE® (Canada, Australia, European Community and Switzerland) trademarks, due to the fact that OssaTrode®, Equitron®, Reflectron® and Reflectrode® products are no longer available for sale in any market and evoPACE® is a product that was never commercialized.
 
Potential Intellectual Property Issues
 
Although we believe that the patents and patent applications, including those that we license, provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and medical device companies are highly complex and uncertain. The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Our success will depend in part on us not infringing on patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors, as well as our ability to enforce our patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products and product candidates, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In enforcement proceedings in Switzerland, we assisted HealthTronics as an informer of misappropriation by a Swiss company called SwiTech and related third parties of intellectual property rights in legacy proprietary software and devices relating to assets we purchased from HealthTronics in August 2005. As a result of this action, SwiTech was forced into bankruptcy. We also pursued the alleged misappropriation by another Swiss company called SwiTalis and related third parties of intellectual property rights in legacy proprietary software and devices relating to assets we purchased from HealthTronics in August 2005. In 2016, SwiTalis claimed copyright rights on the High Voltage Modules that were used in our devices and the old line of Pulse Vet devices during the manufacturing process at Swisstronics in Switzerland. At this time, however, no such court action against Swisstronics is pending in Switzerland and we believe that it is unlikely that SwiTalis will pursue their earlier allegations against Swisstronics and, indirectly, us. In 2017, we abandoned our action against SwiTalis. There can be no assurance, however, that future claims or lawsuits against us may not be brought, and such present or future actions against violations of our intellectual property rights may result in us incurring material expense and divert the attention of management.
 
Third parties that license our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patented technology or copyrighted material, may also take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. In addition, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents, and similar proprietary rights.
 


 
We collaborate with other persons and entities on research, development, and commercialization activities and expect to do so in the future. Disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights in know-how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our collaborators, researchers, licensors, licensees and consultants. In addition, other parties may circumvent any proprietary protection that we do have. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our proprietary position.
 
Competition
 
We believe the advanced wound care market can benefit from our technology which up-regulates the biological factors that promote wound healing. Current medical technologies developed by Acelity (formerly Kinetic Concepts, Inc.), Organogenesis, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Derma Sciences, Inc., MiMedx Group, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Molnlycke Health Care, and Systagenix Wound Management (US), Inc. (now owned by Acelity) manage wounds, but, in our opinion, do not provide the value proposition to the patients and care givers like our PACE technology has the potential to do. The leading medical device serving this market is the Vacuum Assisted Closure (“V.A.C.”) System marketed by KCI. The V.A.C. is a negative pressure wound therapy device that applies suction to debride and manage wounds.
 
There are also several companies that market extracorporeal shockwave device products targeting lithotripsy and orthopedic markets, including Dornier MedTech, Storz Medical AG, Electro Medical Systems (EMS) S.A., and CellSonic Medical which could ultimately pursue the wound care market. Nevertheless, we believe that the dermaPACE® System has a competitive advantage over all of these existing technologies by achieving wound closure by means of a minimally invasive process through innate biological response to PACE technology.
 
Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve widespread market acceptance.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
FDA Regulation
 
Each of our products must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products.
 
In the United States, the FDA subjects medical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
 


 
The FDA has determined that our technology and product candidates constitute “medical devices.” The FDA determines what center or centers within the FDA will review the product and its indication for use, and also determines under what legal authority the product will be reviewed. For the current indications, our products are being reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. However, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not select a different center and/or legal authority for one or more of our other product candidates, in which case the governmental review requirements could vary in some respects.
 
FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

• | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, and post market surveillance, and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of our product candidates require FDA authorization prior to marketing, by means of either a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit, and the FDA must approve, a PMA before marketing can begin.
 
In the past, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing required only the proof of significant equivalence in technology for a given indication with a previously cleared device. Currently, there has been a trend of the FDA requiring additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence. Thus, no matter which regulatory pathway we may take in the future towards marketing products in the United States, we will be required to provide clinical proof of device effectiveness.
 
Within the past few years, the FDA has released guidelines for the FDA’s reviewers to use during a product’s submission review process. This guidance provides the FDA reviewers with a uniform method of evaluating the benefits verses the risks of a device when used for a proposed specific indication. Such a benefit/risk evaluation is very useful when applied to a novel device or to a novel indication and provides the FDA with a consistent tool to document their decision process. While intended as a guide for internal FDA use, the public availability of this guidance allows medical device manufacturers to use the review matrix to develop sound scientific and clinical backup to support proposed clinical claims and to help guide the FDA, through the decision process, to look at the relevant data. We intend to use this benefit/risk tool in our FDA submissions.
 


 
A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing. If the FDA determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While the FDA often follows the panel’s recommendation, there have been instances where the FDA has not. If the FDA finds the information satisfactory, it will approve the PMA. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies post-approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 
During the review of either a PMA application or 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. We cannot be sure that our product candidates will be approved or cleared in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us.
 
Obtaining medical device clearance, approval, or licensing in the United States or abroad can be an expensive process. The fees for submitting an original PMA to the FDA for consideration of device approval are substantial. Fees for supplement PMA’s are less costly but still can be substantial. International fee structures vary from minimal to substantial, depending on the country. In addition, we are subject to annual establishment registration fees in the United States and abroad. Device licenses require periodic renewal with associated fees as well. In the United States, there is an annual requirement for submitting device reports for Class III/PMA devices, along with an associated fee. Currently, we are registered as a Small Business Manufacturer with the FDA and as such are subject to reduced fees. If, in the future, our revenues exceed a certain annual threshold limit, we may not qualify for the Small Business Manufacturer reduced fee amounts and will be required to pay full fee amounts.
 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
 
One or more clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and more recently are becoming necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or un-cleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an IDE application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (IRB) has approved the study.
 
During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 


 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our ability to enroll and treat patients in clinical trials and to monitor data at our clinical trial sites.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

• | the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post market surveillance, including documentation of clinical experience and also follow-on, confirmatory studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements, as are our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and contract testing laboratories.
 
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Exported devices may also fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce/Bureau of Industry and Security and compliance with export regulations may be required for certain countries.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before we can use it. We and some of our third-party service providers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
International Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
 
The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the European Union, which consists of 27 member states encompassing most of the major countries in Europe. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Union Commission have determined that dermaPACE®, orthoPACE, OssaTron and Evotron will be regulated as medical device products. These devices have been determined to be Class IIb devices. These devices are CE Marked and as such can be marketed and distributed within the European Economic Area.
 


 
The primary regulatory body in Canada is Health Canada. In addition to needing appropriate data to obtain market licensing in Canada, we must have an ISO 13485 certification, as well as meet additional requirements of Canadian laws. We currently maintain this certification. We maintain a device license for dermaPACE® with Health Canada for the indication of “devices for application of shock waves (pulsed acoustic waves) on acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue”.
 
The primary regulatory bodies and paths in Asia and Australia are determined by the requisite country authority. In most cases, establishment registration and device licensing are applied for at the applicable Ministry of Health through a local intermediary. The requirements placed on the manufacturer are typically the same as those contained in ISO 9001 or ISO 13485.
 
The primary regulatory body in Brazil is ANVISA, all medical devices imported into or distributed within Brazil must first undergo registration with ANVISA. Once ANVISA makes its final decision on registration applications, the result is published in Brazil’s Official Diary, in addition to ANVISA, our products require additional certification via INMETRO. We currently hold a Class II device licenses in BRAZIL for dermaPACE® and is in the process of registering our UltraMIST® product line
 
European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with cGMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the United States, there are Federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials. Although we intend to structure our future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of our products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of our business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenge by Federal or state enforcement officials under these laws.
Third Party Reimbursement
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, and workers’ compensation plans. These third-party payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for a product or therapy, in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. The third-party payers also may place limitations on the types of physicians or clinicians that can perform specific types of procedures. In addition, third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third-party payers must also pre-approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been approved or cleared by the FDA for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until adequate reimbursement has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.
 


 
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month, and consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use products, including ours.
 
One of the components in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers and governmental payers, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare, is the assignment of a billing code. Billing codes are used to identify the procedures performed when providers submit claims to third party payers for reimbursement for medical services. They also generally form the basis for payment amounts. We will seek new billing codes for the wound care indications of our products as part of our efforts to commercialize such products.
 
The initial phase of establishing a professional billing code for a medical service typically includes applying for a CPT Category III code for both hospital and in-office procedures. This is a tracking code without relative value assigned that allows third party payers to identify and monitor the service as well as establish value if deemed medically necessary. The process includes CPT application submission, clinical discussion with Medical Professional Society CPT advisors as well as American Medical Association (AMA) CPT Editorial Panel review. A new CPT Category III code will be assigned if the AMA CPT Editorial Panel committee deems it meets the applicable criteria and is appropriate. In 2017, we applied for two, new CPT Category III codes for extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in wound healing. These codes were published by AMA/CPT for use beginning January 1, 2019.
 
The secondary phase in the CPT billing code process includes the establishment of a permanent CPT Category I code in which relative value is analyzed and established by the AMA. The approval of this code is based on, among other criteria, widespread usage and established clinical efficacy of the medical service.
 
There are also billing codes that facilities, rather than health care professionals, utilize for the reimbursement of operating costs for a particular medical service. For the hospital outpatient setting, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services automatically classified the new ESWT wound healing CPT Category III codes into interim APC groups. The APC groups are services grouped together based on clinical characteristics and similar costs. An APC classification does not guarantee payment.
 
We believe that the overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. In addition, recent healthcare reform measures, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives at the Federal and state levels, create significant additional uncertainties. There can be no assurance that third party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage or reimbursement would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Confidentiality and Security of Personal Health Information
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS, the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published regulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and to standardize national provider identification codes. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) enacted the HITECH Act, which extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for a violation, establishes new requirements to notify the Office for Civil Rights of HHS of a breach of HIPAA, and allows the Attorneys General of the states to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA. Rules implementing various aspects of HIPAA are continuing to be promulgated.
 


 
We anticipate that, as we expand our dermaPACE® business, we will in the future be a covered entity under HIPAA. We intend to adopt policies and procedures to comply with the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the HIPAA statute as such regulations become applicable to our business and as such regulations are in effect at such time.
 
In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, we may become subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against us for a violation of a state’s privacy laws. We intend to adopt policies and procedures to ensure material compliance with state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information as such laws become applicable to us and to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws on an ongoing basis.
 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to extensive Federal, state, provincial and municipal environmental statutes, regulations and policies, including those promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Environment Canada, Alberta Environment, the Department of Health Services, and the Air Quality Management District, that govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges into air and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes. Some of these statutes and regulations impose strict liability for the costs of cleaning up, and for damages resulting from, sites of spills, disposals, or other releases of contaminants, hazardous substances and other materials and for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at properties leased or operated by us and at off-site locations where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims and lawsuits brought by private parties seeking damages and other remedies with respect to similar matters. We have not to date needed to make material expenditures to comply with current environmental statutes, regulations and policies. However, we cannot predict the impact and costs those possible future statutes, regulations and policies will have on our business.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 40 full time employees in the United States. Of these, eight were engaged in research and development which includes clinical, regulatory and quality. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Corporate Information
 
We were formed as a Nevada corporation in 2004. Our corporate headquarters address is 3360 Martin Farm Road, Suite 100 Suwanee, Georgia 30024, and our main telephone number is (770) 419-7525.

   SANUWAVE HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2021 and 2020
 
 1.          Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
   
 SANUWAVE Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“SANUWAVE” or the “Company”) is focused on the research, development, and commercialization of its patented noninvasive and biological response activating medical systems for the repair and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures. The Company’s lead regenerative product in the United States is the dermaPACE® device used for treating diabetic foot ulcers.   
 Through the Company’s acquisition, on August 6, 2020, of the UltraMIST® assets from Celularity, Inc. (“Celularity”), SANUWAVE now combines two highly complementary and market-cleared energy transfer technologies and two human tissue biologic products, which creates a platform of scale with an end-to-end product offering in the advanced wound care market.   
 Basis of Presentation- The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   
 The functional currencies of the Company’s foreign operations are their local currencies. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiary have been translated into United States dollars. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss and as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.   
 Reclassification – Certain accounts in the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year consolidated financial statements. Accrued executive severance at December 31, 2020 of $154 thousand was reclassified from accrued expenses to accrued employee compensation. This reclassification had no effect on the previously reported operating results.   
 COVID-19 – The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which is likely to decrease demand for a broad variety of products, including from our customers. We have experienced a disruption of our supply channels which will continue for an unknown period of time until the global supply chain can return to the pre- disease status. Also, the pandemic may cause continued or additional actions by hospitals and clinics such as limiting elective procedures and treatments and limiting clinical trial activities and data monitoring. These factors have had and we expect that they will continue to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict.  
    2.          Going Concern
   
 Our recurring losses from operations and dependency upon future issuances of equity or other financing to fund ongoing operations have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.   
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon raising additional capital. We expect to devote substantial resources for the commercialization of the dermaPACE and will continue to research and develop the non-medical uses of the PACE technology, both of which will require additional capital resources.   The operating losses and the events of default on the Company’s notes payable indicate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the filing of this Form 10-K.   
 F-6
 
 Table of Contents
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon raising additional capital to fund operations. Management’s plans are to obtain additional capital in 2022 through investments by strategic partners for market opportunities, which may include strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements, or raise capital through the conversion of outstanding warrants, issuance of common or preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock, or secured or unsecured debt. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders. In addition, there can be no assurances that our plans to obtain additional capital will be successful on the terms or timeline we expect, or at all. Although no assurances can be given, management believes that potential additional issuances of equity or other potential financing transactions as discussed above should provide the necessary funding for us. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds through financing transactions with unfavorable terms.   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
    3.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   
 The significant accounting policies followed by the Company are summarized below:   
 Estimates – These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because a precise determination of assets and liabilities, and correspondingly revenues and expenses, depend on future events, the preparation of consolidated financial statements for any period necessarily involves the use of estimates and assumptions. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the accounting policies summarized herein.   
 Significant estimates include the recording of allowances for doubtful accounts, the net realizable value of inventory, useful lives of long-lived assets, fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets, the determination of the valuation allowances for deferred taxes, estimated fair value of stock-based compensation, and the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives, including warrants and embedded conversion options.   
 Cash - The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which may exceed federally insured limits.   
 Accounts receivable - Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Receivables are generally considered past due if greater than 60 days old. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts.   
 Concentration of credit risk - Management routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes accounts receivable are stated at the net realizable value and credit risk exposure is limited.   
 Inventory - Inventory consists of purchased medical equipment and parts and is stated at the lower of cost, which is valued using the first in, first out (“FIFO”) method, or net realizable value less allowance for selling and distribution expenses. The Company analyzes its inventory levels and writes down inventory that has, or is expected to, become obsolete.

 Property and equipment – Property and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of additions and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets, are expensed. The straight-line method of depreciation is used for computing depreciation on property and equipment over the following estimated useful lives:
   
  
 | Estimated Useful Life 
------------------------------+--------------------------
Machines and equipment | 3 years 
Office and computer equipment | 3 years 
Medical devices on rent | 5 - 15 years 
Software | 2years 
Furniture and fixtures | 3 years 


 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Company completes its goodwill impairment test annually in the fourth quarter. The Company performed a qualitative evaluation at the reporting unit level and determined there was no Goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2021. Intangible assets arising from the Company’s acquisition are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Customer relationships have a useful life of seven years. Patents and tradenames have a useful life of nineteen years. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that intangible assets related to certain customer relationships was impaired. See Note 8 for additional discussion of this impairment. The Company has determined that there were no impairment to goodwill or intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2021.
   
 Impairment of long-lived assets – The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the asset’s carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company determines fair value by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate. Except for the impairment of the intangible assets discussed above, the Company determined that no impairment of long-lived assets was indicated at December 31, 2021.   
 Leases – We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, we account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.   
 For leases where the Company is the lessee, Right of Use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases did not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company used the equivalent borrowing rate for a secured financing with the term of equal to the remaining life of the lease at inception.   
 Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and we recognize lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the event a lease arrangement would provide us with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement, we would include these options when we are reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. None of our lease agreements include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.

 Fair value of financial instruments - The carrying values of accounts payable, and other short-term obligations approximate their fair values, because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.   
 The Company utilizes the guidance of ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820-10”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The framework that is set forth in this standard is applicable to the fair value measurements where it is permitted or required under other accounting pronouncements.   
 The ASC 820-10 hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs, or assumptions, used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
 
Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
 Preferred stock – The Company evaluates preferred stock issuances for liability or equity classification in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and determines appropriate equity or liability accounting treatment. Additionally, the Company determines, if classified as equity, whether it would be recorded as permanent or temporary equity.   
 Sequencing policy – The Company follows sequencing policy for which in the event partial reclassifications of contracts subject to ASC Topic 815-40-25, Derivatives and Hedging, is necessary, due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient authorized shares, shares will be allocated on the basis of earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments with the earliest grants receiving first allocation of shares. 

  
 Convertible instruments and liabilities related to warrants issued – The Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those contracts, qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record embedded conversion options (“ECOs”) and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as amortization of debt discount on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss over the life of the underlying instrument. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. A binomial model was used to estimate the fair value of the ECOs of warrants that are classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The models include subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the actual volatility during the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average life of the instruments.

 Warrants related to debt issued – The Company records a warrant discount related to warrants issued with debt at fair value and recognizes the cost using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt as interest expense, which is reported in the Other Income (Expense) section in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. This warrant discount is reported as a reduction of the related debt liability.   
 Beneficial conversion feature on convertible debt - The Company records a beneficial conversion feature related convertible debt at fair value and recognizes the cost using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt as interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. This beneficial conversion feature is reported as a reduction of the related debt liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.   
 Segment information - We have determined that we have one operating segment. Our revenues are generated from sales in United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Asia/Pacific. All significant expenses are generated in the United States and all significant assets are located in the United States.   
 Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue in accordance with two different Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) standards: 1) Topic 606 and 2) Topic 842. 
        Topic 606   The core principle of ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In accordance with ASC 606, we apply the following the five-step model:    
      
 
1. | Identify the contract(s) with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract promises to transfer more than one good or service to a customer, each good or service constitutes a separate performance obligation if the good or service is distinct or capable of being distinct. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchanging the promised goods or services to the customer. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. For each performance obligation, we determine whether we satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time or over time. Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods and input methods. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Table of Contents
 The Company recognizes revenue primarily from the following types of contracts under ASC 606: 
   
 
 Product Sales and Accessory and Part Sales - Product sales and accessory and part sales include devices and applicators (new and refurbished). Performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is generally at the point in time that the product is shipped.
   
      
 Licensing Fees - Licensing transactions include distribution licenses and intellectual property licenses. Licensing revenue is recognized as the Company satisfies its performance obligations, which may vary with the terms of the licensing agreement.
   
      
 Other Revenue - Other revenue primarily includes warranties, repairs and billed freight. Device product sales are bundled with an initial one-year warranty and the Company offers a separately priced second-year warranty. The Company allocates the device sales price to the product and the embedded warranty by reference to the stand-alone extended warranty price. Because the warranty represents a stand-ready obligation, revenue is recognized over the time period that the Company satisfies its performance obligations, which is generally the warranty term. Repairs (parts and labor) and billed freight revenue are recognized at the point in time that the service is performed, or the product is shipped, respectively.
   
       
 
 Topic 842   
 The Company recognizes revenue primarily from the following types of contracts under ASC 842:   
      
 Rental and Pay per Use Income - Rental revenue represents revenues earned from renting equipment either on a monthly basis or on a pay per use. We account for these rental contracts as operating leases and revenue will be recognized on a straight-line basis in the period billed to the customer. However, under the pay per use agreement, the Company will earn revenues based on the number of times the device is used.      
 
 The lease terms are included in our contracts, and the determination of whether our contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. In some cases, a rental contract may contain a rental purchase option, whereby the customer has an option to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the term for a specified price. Revenues related to the rental contract will be accounted for as an operating lease as the option to purchase is not reasonably certain to be exercised. Lessees do not provide residual value guarantees on rented equipment.    
 Shipping and handling costs - Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenues. Shipping and handling costs incurred have been recorded in cost of revenues.   
 Research and development - Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include payments to third parties that specifically relate to the Company’s products in clinical development, such as payments to contract research organizations, consulting fees for FDA submissions, universities performing non-medical related research and insurance premiums for clinical studies and non-medical research. In addition, employee costs (salaries, payroll taxes, benefits and travel) for employees of the clinical affairs, and research and development departments are classified as research and development costs.   
 Comprehensive income (loss) – Comprehensive income (loss) results from the translation of the Company’s foreign entity’s financial statements from their functional currency to U.S. dollars for consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements –   
  In August 2020, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature and simplifies the guidance for determining whether a conversion feature is a derivative. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. These changes will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to previously existing rules. In addition, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 had no impact on the Company’s previously reported financial position or operating results. 
   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was subsequently revised by ASU 2018-19. The ASU introduces a new model for assessing impairment of most financial assets. Entities will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model, which will replace the current incurred loss model, which will result in earlier recognition of allowance for losses. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after January 2023 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.   
 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes in several areas including calculating taxes in an interim period, clarifying how to account for taxes that are partially based on income and requiring an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021 with no impact on previously reported financial position or operating results.   
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 modified the testing that an entity should perform for its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.   
 In May 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU will be effective for us on January 1, 2022. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.

    4.          Loss per share
   
 The net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In accordance with ASC Topic 260-10-45-13, Earnings Per Share, the weighted average of number of shares outstanding includes outstanding common stock and shares issuable for nominal consideration. Accordingly, warrants issued with a $0.01 per share exercise price, are included in weighted average shares outstanding as follows:
   
 
 | 2021 | | 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------+-------------+-----
Weighted average shares outstanding | | | 
Common shares | | 481,619,621 | | 359,880,132
Common shares issuable assuming excercise of nominally priced warrants | | 36,736,021 | | 18,248,513 
Weighted average shares outstanding | | 518,355,642 | | 378,128,645

   
 Diluted net loss per share would be computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. To the extent that securities are “anti-dilutive,” they are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share. As a result of the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, all potentially dilutive shares were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share. Anti-dilutive equity securities consist of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands):
   
 
 | 2021 | | 2020
-------------------------------+------+---------+-----
Common stock options | | 31,760 | | 31,938 
Common stock purchase warrants | | 168,192 | | 142,266
Convertible notes payable | | 90,380 | | 58,657 
 | | 290,332 | | 232,861

    5.          Asset Purchase Agreement
   
 On August 6, 2020, the Company completed an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Celularity pursuant to which the Company acquired (the “Transaction”) Celularity’s UltraMIST® assets (“UltraMIST®”, or the “Assets”). The acquisition provides the Company with a robust product offering in the advanced wound care market and gives the Company an end-to-end advanced wound care product portfolio that addresses the entire care pathway. The aggregate consideration paid for the Assets was $24.0 million, which consisted of (i) a cash payment of $18.9 million, (ii) the issuance of a convertible promissory note to Celularity in the principal amount of $4.0 million (the “Seller Note”), and (iii) a credit of $1.1 million for the previous payment made by the Company to Celularity pursuant to that certain letter of intent between the Company and Celularity dated June 7, 2020.   
 In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, on August 6, 2020, we entered into a license and marketing agreement with Celularity pursuant to which Celularity granted to the Company a license to the Celularity wound care biologic products, Biovance® and Interfyl® (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement provides the Company with an exclusive license to use, market, distribute and sell Biovance® in the field and territory, as defined in the License Agreement, and a non-exclusive license to use, market, distribute and sell Interfyl® in the field and in the territory. The License Agreement has an initial five-year term, after which it automatically renews for additional one-year periods, unless either party provides written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the current term. The license agreement calls for prepaid minimum quarterly upfront royalty of $446 thousand of payments for Biovance which are credited against sales in that quarter. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company had accrued $893 thousand and $336 thousand of license fees, respectively. Royalties are based on a transfer price for each Biovance product and sales are reported on a quarterly basis to Celularity. In the event of sales in excess of the quarterly minimums, any additional royalties are due at that time.

 Table of Contents
 The Company evaluated the transaction and has accounted for it as a business combination and applied the related accounting guidance as required, using the acquisition method and a fair value model.   
 The tables below present the consideration paid to Celularity and the fair value of the Assets acquired on August 6, 2020 (dollars in thousands):   
 
Purchase Consideration | | 
---------------------------------------+---+-----
Cash paid at closing | $ | 18.9
Cash paid pursuant to letter of intent | | 1.1 
Note payable to seller | | 4.0 
Total Consideration | $ | 24.0


Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired | | 
----------------------------------------+---+-----
Inventory | $ | 1.9 
Property and equipment | | 0.4 
Intangible assets (1) | | 14.4
Goodwill (2) | | 7.3 
Total fair value of net assets acquired | $ | 24.0


1. | Intangible assets, as summarized below, are recorded at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the acquired customer relationships is determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that intangible assets related to certain customer relationships was impaired. See Note 8 for additional discussion of this impairment. The estimated fair value of the acquired patent and trade names is based on a relief from royalty method. The estimated useful lives for intangible assets were determined based on the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over fair value of the assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of SANUWAVE and UltraMIST®, including expected future synergies and operating efficiencies. Goodwill resulting from the Transaction has been assigned to the Company’s lone operating segment. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes (dollars in thousands).

 Senior secured promissory note payable, in default (“Senior Secured Note”) - On August 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase and Security Agreement (the “NWPSA”), with NH Expansion Credit Fund Holdings LP, as noteholder and agent. In accordance with the NWPSA, the Company issued a $15 million Senior Secured Promissory Note Payable (the “Senior Secured Note”) and a warrant exercisable into shares of the Company’s common stock (the “NH Expansion Warrant”) in exchange for cash to support operations, repay outstanding debt and close on the acquisition of the UltraMIST® assets from Celularity, among other transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in default of the minimum liquidity provisions on the Senior Secured Note. As of December 31, 2021, the Company remains in default of the minimum liquidity provisions on the Senior Secured Note, and, as a result, it is classified in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the default, the Company is accruing interest at the default interest note of an incremental 5%.   
 The debt issuance costs and debt discount related to the Senior Secured Note were capitalized as a reduction in the principal amount and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Senior Secured Note. The amortization of the debt issuance costs and debt discount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $910 thousand and is included in interest expense. Accrued interest related to the Senior Secured Note was $1.6 million and $642 thousand at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Interest expense on the Senior Secured Note was $3.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.   
 Convertible promissory notes payable, in default (“Seller Note”) - On August 6, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Celularity to acquire Celularity’s UltraMIST® assets. A portion of the aggregate consideration of $24 million paid for the assets included the issuance of a promissory note to Celularity in the principal amount of $4 million (the “Seller Note”). The Seller Note matured on August 6, 2021 and was not repaid. The Company’s failure to pay the outstanding principal balance when due constituted an event of default under the terms of the Seller Note and, accordingly, it began accruing additional interest of 5.0% in addition to the 12.0% initial rate, as of the date of the default. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Seller Notes had outstanding accrued interest of $761 thousand and $192 thousand, respectively.

Upon adoption of ASC 2020-6 effective January 1, 2021, the convertible promissory note is accounted for as a single liability due to the elimination of the beneficial conversion feature accounting model.   
  April 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement and Warrants (In default) - On April 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Leviston Purchase Agreement”), with Leviston Resources, LLC, an accredited investor (“Leviston”) for the sale by the Company in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of (i) the Company’s future advance convertible promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.4 million (the “Leviston Note”) and (ii) a warrant to purchase an additional 16,666,667 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Leviston Warrant”). The Leviston Warrant has an exercise price of $0.18 per share and a four-year term. The closing of the Private Placement occurred on April 20, 2021 (the “Leviston Closing Date”).   
 As noted above, on April 20, 2021, the Company issued the Leviston Note to the Purchaser in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.4 million (the “Aggregate Amount”), which shall be advanced in disbursements by the Purchaser (“Leviston Disbursements”), as set forth in the Leviston Note. On May 14, 2021, the Leviston Note was amended to increase the Aggregate Amount to $4.2 million. On April 21, 2021, the Purchaser advanced a Leviston Disbursement of $750 thousand, which is net of an original issue discount of 8%. On May 14, 2021, the Purchaser advanced a second Leviston Disbursement of $750 thousand, also net of an original issue discount of 8%. A $250 thousand Leviston Disbursement was made on September 3, 2021, which was subject to the same terms and conditions of the April and May Leviston Disbursements. In addition, a $500 thousand disbursement was made on September 3, 2021 in accordance with notes issued to five institutional investors (the “Five Institutions’ Notes”), which were subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the Leviston Disbursements. Accrued interest related to the Securities Purchase Agreement and Warrants was $169 thousand at December 31, 2021. Interest expense on the Securities Purchase Agreement and Warrants was $169 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In conjunction with the 24-week agreement, the Company is obligated to remit to GCF a minimum of $59 thousand of receipts each week for the first six weeks and receipts of $98 thousand for the remaining 18 weeks. After considering the payments made at closing, the Company will record an initial liability of $1.5 million and a debt discount of approximately $90 thousand, which represents the original issue discount and the fees paid in conjunction with the financing. The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the agreement. The Company will begin making the required minimum weekly payments January 3, 2022 and is obligated to continue through June 13, 2022. At closing, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 8,333,334 shares of the Company’s common stock to affiliates of GCF. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.18 per share and expire four years after issuance. The Company has evaluated the terms of the warrants and after review has determined that these warrants meet the definition of a derivative liability and accordingly, were recorded as additional discount against the debt at issuance.

 Interest rates on Leviston and Five Institutions’ Notes, Conversion Option, and Loss on Issuance
   The Leviston Disbursements and Five Institutions’ Disbursements in April, May and September 2021, bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the default rate of 15%. The Leviston Note and Five Institutions’ Notes contains a conversion option (“Conversion Option”) and because they are in default, the Leviston and Five Institutions’ Notes are convertible into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of 75% of the lowest VWAP during the ten trading days ending on the conversion date. For the Five Institutions’ Note this conversion rate shall be no lower than $0.01. The Conversion Option within the Leviston and Five Institutions’ Notes are required to be bifurcated at fair value, which was approximately $1.4 million on the April disbursement and $1.4 million on the May disbursement and $1.4 million on the September disbursements, which resulted in additional debt discounts being recorded at each disbursement date. Because the combined fair value of the applicable warrants and conversion option exceeded the face value of the note, the additional amount beyond the face value is recorded as a loss on issuance of $1.4 million on the April disbursement and $1.1 million on the May disbursement and $1.1 million on the September disbursement. The remaining disbursements up to the Aggregate Amount are subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions set forth in the applicable notes. The disbursements bear an interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum and have a maturity date of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. The Leviston and Five Institutions’ Notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the common stock of the Company at a conversion price per share equal to the lesser of (i) $0.18, and (ii) ninety percent (90%) of the closing price for a share of common stock reported on the OTCQB on the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined below).     
 The Leviston and Five Institutions’ Note contains customary events of default and covenants, including limitations on incurrences of indebtedness and liens.     
  Pursuant to the Leviston Purchase Agreement and purchase agreements with the Five Institutions (the “Five Institutions’ Purchase Agreements”), the Company has agreed, within a reasonable period of time following the applicable closing date, and in any event prior to any Leviston Disbursement under the Leviston Note subsequent to the initial Leviston Disbursement, to enter into a security agreement in favor of the Leviston or the Five Institutions, as applicable, securing the Company’s obligations under the applicable notes.     
  The rights of Leviston and the Five Institutions to receive payments under the applicable notes are subordinate to the rights of North Haven Expansion pursuant to the subordination agreements that the Company and Leviston, and the Company and the Five Institutions entered into with North Haven Expansion on April 20, 2021 and September 3, 2021, respectively, in connection with the Private Placement (the “Subordination Agreement”).   
 In connection with the Leviston Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the Leviston on April 20, 2021 (the “Leviston Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC no later than thirty days following the Leviston Closing Date for the registration of 100% of the maximum number of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Leviston Note and exercise of the Leviston Warrants issued pursuant to the Leviston Purchase Agreement (the “Leviston Registrable Securities”). The Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), until all Leviston Registrable Securities have been sold, or may be sold without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) of the Securities Act and otherwise without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, as determined by the counsel to the Company. The Company has yet to file the Registration Statement and, under the terms of the Leviston Registration Rights Agreement, it is obligated to pay in cash a one-time aggregate amount of $250 thousand to the holders of the Leviston Notes, plus 1% of the outstanding principal for each 30-day period during which the Company continues not to have in-place an effective Registration Statement.   
 On August 31, 2021, Leviston notified the Company that it was in default of the Leviston Purchase Agreement effective June 11, 2021, for failure to timely file a Registration Statement. From the date of the default, interest on the amounts due to Leviston is calculated at the default interest rate of 15% in addition to the registration penalties stated above.   
 The Company also entered into registration rights agreements with each of the Five Institutions on September 3, 2021.  The terms and conditions of the Five Institutions’ registration rights agreements are substantially similar to the Leviston Registration Rights Agreement, with two exceptions: (1) the Five Institutions may be entitled to a pro-rata share of the $250 thousand one-time aggregate amount (approximately $56 thousand) and (2) the 1% of outstanding principal payment amount for each 30-day period is capped at 5% of outstanding principal.

After taking into account the payments made at closing, the Company recorded an initial liability of $763 thousand and a debt discount of approximately $60 thousand, which represents the original issue discount and the fees paid in conjunction with the financing.  The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the agreement.  The Company began making the required minimum weekly payments October 25, 2021.  At closing, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 5,555,556 shares of the Company’s common stock to affiliates of GCF.  The warrants have an exercise price of $0.18 per share and expire four years after issuance. The Company determined that these warrants meet the definition of a derivative liability and accordingly, were recorded as additional discount against the debt at issuance.
   
 SBA Loan #1 - The Company received a letter from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) dated August 27, 2021 forgiving approximately $454 thousand of the SBA Loan #1 principal and $6 thousand of interest, which resulted in the Company recognizing a gain on extinguishment of debt of $460 thousand during the third quarter of 2021.   
 SBA Loan #2 – On February 20, 2021, the Company received proceeds from a second SBA loan (“SBA Loan #2”) in the amount of $1.03 million from Northeast Bank, as lender, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under the CARES Act. SBA Loan #2 is evidenced by a promissory note that matures on February 20, 2026 and bears interest of 1% per annum. Equal monthly payments of principal and interest commence in June 2022, after both a 24-week “covered period” and a 10-month “deferment period,” as defined in the promissory note and current SBA regulations. The SBA Loan #2 contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. The SBA Loan #2 may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no penalties.   
 F-23
 
 Table of Contents
  All or a portion of SBA Loan #2 may be fully or partially forgiven by the SBA upon application by the Company not later than June 2022 in accordance with SBA regulations. The ultimate forgiveness of SBA Loan #2 is also contingent upon regulatory authorities concurring with management’s good faith assessment that the current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support ongoing operations. If, despite the Company’s good-faith belief that given the circumstances the Company satisfied all eligibility requirements for SBA Loan #2, the Company is later determined to have violated any applicable laws or regulations or it is otherwise determined that the Company was ineligible to receive SBA Loan #2, the Company may be required to repay SBA Loan #2 in its entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties. In the event SBA Loan #2, or any portion thereof, is forgiven pursuant to the PPP, the amount forgiven is applied to outstanding principal. As of December 31, 2021, $158 thousand is included in current liabilities and the remainder of the $875 thousand loan balance is included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.      14.

 In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), the Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets, including loss carryforwards, when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.   
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period which the new legislation is enacted. The CARES Act made various tax law changes including among other things (i) increasing the limitation under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”) for 2019 and 2020 to permit additional expensing of interest (ii) enacting a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC Section 168(k), (iii) making modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes and (iv) enhancing the recoverability of alternative minimum tax credits. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company.   
 The income tax provision (benefit) from continuing operations consists of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

 At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, no additional income or withholding taxes have been provided for. The Company does not anticipate any impacts of the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) and base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and as such, the Company has not recorded any impact associated with either GILTI or BEAT.   
 The income tax provision (benefit) amounts differ from the amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 to pretax loss from operations as a result of the following for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers, whether it is “more likely than not”, that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible.   
 ASC 740 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is “more likely than not” that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available, management believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has, therefore, established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.   
 The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards could be limited and subject to annual limitations. Since a full analysis under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has not been performed, the Company may realize a “more than 50% change in ownership” which could limit its ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards accumulated to date to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities. Additionally, because United States tax laws limit the time during which net operating loss carryforwards may be applied against future taxable income and tax liabilities, the Company may not be able to take advantage of all or portions of its net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.   
 The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $77.9 million from years ending December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2017 will begin to expire in 2025. The federal and state net operating loss carryforward for the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2021 of approximately $56.5 million will not expire. The foreign net operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2019 of $0.1 million will begin to expire in 2024.

 A provision of ASC 740 specifies that companies are to account for uncertainties in income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for recognizing, reversing, and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions would “more-likely-than-not” be sustained if challenged by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company does not expect any significant changes in the unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date.   
 The Company will recognize in income tax expense, interest and penalties related to income tax matters. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any amounts recorded for interest and penalties.
