Overview
 
iPic Entertainment Inc. (“iPic”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) strives to be our guests’ favorite local destination for a night out on the town. Our newest locations blend three distinct areas — a polished-casual restaurant, a farm-to-glass full-service bar, and our world-class luxury theater auditoriums with in-theater dining — into a one-of-a-kind experience. Our team endeavors to deliver world class hospitality in innovative, one-of-a-kind theaters which we believe are among the finest in the world. Our chefs and mixologists create craveable food and drink offerings that are outstanding on a standalone basis, but it is the interplay between our movie-entertainment, dining and full-service bar areas that is the defining feature of a typical four-hour guest experience. We thoughtfully design the layout, ambiance, and energy-flow of each unit to maximize the crossover between these activities. With constantly changing movie content and menu offerings, each visit is different, providing our customers with a reason to visit us repeatedly. We believe we deliver an experience that is innovative, unique and cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without the hassle of having to visit multiple destinations. Our locations also act as great venues for private events, family and business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. We believe our concept is well-positioned within today’s ever-increasing experiential economy.
 
We believe we pioneered the concept of polished-casual dining in a luxury theater auditorium and are one of the largest combined movie theater and restaurant entertainment destinations with locations engineered from the ground up to provide our guests with a luxurious movie-going experience at an affordable price. We currently operate 123 screens at 16 locations in 9 states, with an additional 3 locations under construction, and a pipeline of an additional 12 sites that either have a signed lease or are in lease negotiations.
 
Our iPic locations have three different formats. In 2018, the Company closed one location and remodeled five locations.
 
Our Generation I locations: We have two locations that are designated as our First-Generation format (South Barrington, IL; and Bolingbrook, IL). These locations were built between 2007 and 2010, and do not have a separate restaurant attached. These sites tested and validated the business-model for Premium Plus seating and service, and, over time, began to showcase the synergistic opportunity of having a complementary restaurant and dining experience within the facility. In 2018, these Generation I locations averaged approximately $4.5 million of revenues, or about $0.6 million per screen. The Company closed its Glendale, WI location, an original Generation I location, effective March 8, 2018.

Our Generation II locations: Locations in our Second-Generation format (Boca Raton, FL; Bethesda, MD; Westwood, CA; and Miami, FL) were built in 2011 to 2014. These Generation II locations feature a Tuck Hospitality Group signature restaurant (City Perch, Tanzy, or Tuck Room Tavern). Among other things, these locations further expand the quality and quantity of our Premium Plus auditorium sections (which generally sell out first, indicating growing consumer preference for added luxury and service), upgraded the in-theater dining experience with our redesigned iPic Express offerings, and launched the iPic Life program, which is a 20-minute on screen lifestyle program. In 2018, our Generation II locations averaged approximately $12.6 million of revenues, or about $1.7 million per screen.
 
Our Generation III locations: The latest four iPic openings are representative of our Third-Generation format (Houston, TX; Ft. Lee, NJ; Fulton Market, NY; and Dobbs Ferry, NY) and represent our go-forward development design for the foreseeable future. These locations include our perfected auditorium layout (six to eight screens, 500 seats, and elevated ratio of Premium Plus seating) and introduced our patent-pending POD seating and patented chaise lounges. In 2018, our Generation III locations averaged approximately $13.6 million of revenues, or about $1.7 million per screen.
 
Remodeled Locations: Five iPic locations were remodeled in 2018. Four locations previously considered as Generation I locations (Redmond, WA; Pasadena, CA; Austin, TX; and Fairview, TX) were remodeled to offer exclusively Premium Plus seating and one unit previously considered as a Generation II location (Scottsdale, AZ) was remodeled to offer predominantly Premium Plus seating. In 2018, these locations averaged approximately $6.7 million of revenues, or about $0.9 million per screen. These figures include significant screen closure periods during remodeling projects, ranging from 6 to 8 weeks with at least 2 auditoriums closing at a time.
 
Growth Strategies and Outlook
 
Opening new iPic locations. This is our greatest immediate opportunity for growth. We believe that we are still in the very nascent stage of our growth story. We currently operate 123 screens at 16 locations in 9 states with an additional 3 locations under construction and a pipeline of an additional 12 sites that either have a signed lease or are in lease negotiation. We believe we currently control less than 0.5% market share of the theater business in the United States, based on data provided by the National Association of Theatre Owners and our financial results. We believe there is tremendous whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new U.S. markets, as well as overseas, and we have invested in our infrastructure through new hires at our home office to enable us to continue to grow with discipline. We upgraded four of our six Generation I locations in 2018 and plan to open at least two new domestic locations in 2019.


We will continue to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we can achieve consistent high store revenues and attractive store-level cash-on-cash returns.

Pursuing international growth opportunities. We are actively exploring the potential to expand the iPic brand internationally through licensed or asset-light partnerships. We signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with BAS Global Investments to develop luxurious restaurant-and-theater iPic locations throughout The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As of November 6, 2018, we were cleared to receive a license to operate theaters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and should receive the license once the required final documents are processed.
 
Growing our comparable-store sales. We intend to grow our comparable-store sales by continuing to differentiate the iPic brand from other food and entertainment alternatives, through the following strategies:
 
Differentiate our food and beverage offering. We frequently test new menu items and seek to improve our food offering to offer up-to-date culinary options and to best align with our customers’ evolving preferences and increasing sense of experimentation with new tastes.
 
Relentless efforts on hospitality. We strive to provide an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes standards of excellence in hospitality. We believe there are opportunities to increase our sales and average check through continuous improvement of the server experience, including the dual-track effort of introducing new do-it-yourself technology, such as our order-and-pay app and boosting speed and accuracy of our Ninja service model to include a new tablet ordering system.
 
Grow usage of alternative content. While Hollywood studios will remain our primary content providers for the foreseeable future, we are nevertheless focused on providing our customers with new and creative alternative content, including: live shows (including magic acts), Netflix programming, eSporting events (such as Minecraft gaming), concerts, educational and personal events, as well as corporate conferences and seminars.
 
Enhance brand awareness and drive incremental visits to our locations through innovative marketing and promotions. We plan to continue investing a significant portion of our marketing spend in social-media advertising. We have recently launched customized local store marketing programs to increase new visits and repeat visits to individual locations. Our guest loyalty program currently has approximately 2 million members, and we are aggressively improving our search engine and social marketing efforts. Our loyalty program and digital efforts allow us to communicate promotional offers directly to our most passionate brand fans. We also leverage our investments in technology across our marketing platform, including in-store marketing initiatives to drive incremental sales throughout the iPic location.
 
Grow our special events usage. We plan to continue to leverage and add resources to our special events sales effort to grow our corporate and personal event business. In addition to driving revenue, we believe our special events business is an important sampling opportunity for these guests because many are experiencing iPic for the first time.
 
Improving profitability from existing locations. A significant revenue driver will be the remodeling of the Company’s Generation I legacy locations into Generation III designs that, among other things, will include the installation of predominately Premium Plus seating, including iPic’s latest patent pending pod seats and patented chaise lounges. Our Generation III designs, which contain significantly more Premium Plus seating, generate significantly higher revenue per screen than our Generation I locations. We completed five remodels in 2018; four Generation I sites were remodeled and one Generation II site was remodeled.
 
Improving our margins. We believe we are well-positioned to increase margins and believe we have additional opportunities to reduce costs. We also believe that improved labor scheduling technology will allow us to increase labor productivity in the future. We believe that our continued focus on operating margins at individual locations and the deployment of best practices across our store base is expected to yield incremental margin improvements.

Increasing digital growth options (membership and sponsorship). The Company plans to leverage its growing membership network as the brand expands and increases its market presence. In 2018, iPic’s members that have visited a location over the past year accounted for approximately 48% of revenue. In 2018, the Company earned $3.3 million from corporate sponsorships and believes that it has the opportunity to significantly grow its local and national sponsorship revenue.
 
Site Selection Process
 
iPic is focused on clustered growth in predominantly the top 50 metropolitan statistical areas including the densest urban areas as well as high population or high growth affluent suburban markets. Potential locations are sourced both internally through target market searches and relationships with hundreds of developers, and externally through our network of top retail brokers in each target region. In order to optimize new location productivity, we systematically screen potential sites based on the size and quality of the local population. We utilize multiple data platforms that provide sophisticated demographic analyses allowing us to evaluate not only population and income, but also spending patterns and psychographics of the markets surrounding each potential location.
Marketing, Advertising and Promotions
 
Our corporate marketing department manages all consumer outreach initiatives for iPic with the goal of driving sales through expanding our customer reach (guest base) and frequency. Our key areas of focus include:

● | Marketing and Advertising: Public-relations, media, social media, promotions, in-store merchandising, pricing, and digital programs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Food and Beverage: Continuous menu and product development and relentless focus on in-store execution; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Guest insights: Ongoing research into brand health and guest tracking. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have improved marketing effectiveness in 2018 through a number of initiatives designed to improve our local marketing plans, in-store promotions, digital loyalty programs and digital interfaces with consumers that included:
 

● | Performing research to better understand our guest base and fine-tune the brand positioning; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Refining our marketing strategy to better reach our target audience of 21-54 year-olds; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations — Food and Beverage and Cinema
 
Our Restaurant Brands
 
Our Tuck Hospitality Group operates five different and distinct restaurant brands under the leadership of 3-time James Beard Award winning chef and FoodTV personality Sherry Yard. Each future iPic location will consist of one of our fine polished-casual dining concepts.
City Perch Kitchen + Bar is a social seasonal American dining destination concept featuring locally-sourced ingredients.
 
Tanzy offers artisanal Italian cuisine is focused on garden-fresh modern Italian flavors in a social environment to share with friends, family, and colleagues.
 
The Tuck Room is a spirited drinking and dining den concept with a vibrant social destination with an inviting and intimate atmosphere.
 
The Tuck Room Tavern is a neighborhood place where you can eat and drink with enthusiasm and pleasure featuring American cuisine.
 
iPic Express is our answer to a theater concession stand that features a chef-driven menu from our in-house and guest chefs, prepared to order for our Premium Plus customers to be carried to their seats by our Ninja servers or for our Premium-Level guests to carry into the cinema
 
Management. Food and Beverage management is headed by our Chief Operating Officer. Supported by the National Beverage Director and the Vice President of Restaurant Operations, the Food and Beverage management team is responsible for developing and operating all of iPic’s food service operations.
 
Operational Tools and Programs. We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. Consolidated business intelligence and reporting tools are utilized by Regional Operations Directors and Senior General Managers to be able to identify issues, forecast more efficiently, and glean quicker insights for improved decision-making.
Management Information Systems. We utilize a number of proprietary and third party management information systems. These systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and enterprise data, and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense.
Training. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of our restaurants and cinemas. Team members are certified by us for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness training. We require our new store managers to complete an 8-week training program that includes front of the house service, kitchen, amusements, and management responsibilities.
Management Development. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs in order to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important, because it helps us provide our guests with a quality experience from day one. After a store opens and is operating smoothly, the managers supervise the training of new team members.
Recruiting and Retention. We seek to hire experienced General Managers and team members, and we believe we offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Our store managers all participate in a performance-based incentive program that is based on sales, profit and employee retention goals. In addition, our salaried employees are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and also receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure.
Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing. We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process.

Information Technology
 
Information Technology is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our restaurants and theaters, as well as the management of our business. We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our restaurant and theater operations. We continue to focus on improving the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via the web and our mobile application, while also offering self-service alternatives such as ticketing kiosks. Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line. These solutions align with our goal of delivering a first-class customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner. In addition, we continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve the services we provide to our patrons and to provide information to our management allowing them to operate our sites efficiently. The sales and attendance information collected by our point-of-sale system is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as provides the primary source of data for our financial systems. We also use best-in-class inventory management systems to control costs, streamline operations, and reduce waste across our foodservice operations.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We have registered and applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs.
 
We have thirty one utility and design patents issued, as well as several pending patent applications in the United States. Such patent applications are subject to the review and normal course prosecution before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may result in the application’s revision or non-approval. We also have registered or applied for utility and design patents in various foreign countries. As a result, we may not be able to adequately protect the inventions covered by these patent applications, and our competitors and others may benefit as a result of their publication.
 
The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in the markets in which we operate. If our efforts to maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.
 
Competition
 
The out-of-home entertainment and dining markets are highly competitive. We compete for guests’ discretionary entertainment and dining dollars with theme parks, as well as with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, nightclubs and restaurants. We also face competition from local establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food.
 
The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry. Our theaters are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Moviegoers are not as brand conscious as certain other types of consumers and usually choose a theater based on its location, the films showing there, showtimes and its amenities. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based and on-the-go forms of entertainment, such as video-on-demand, video streaming services — such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu — internet and video gaming.
 
Like the motion picture exhibition industry, the restaurant industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry. We compete in the restaurant industry with multi-unit national, regional and locally-owned and/or operated limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. In most cases, these competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence, better locations and greater name recognition nationally or in some of the local markets in which we operate or plan to operate.

Seasonality
 
Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday season. Therefore, our business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and year-end holiday season. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. Given the relatively small number of theaters and screens that we operate (particularly when compared to our larger competitors), if a major motion picture studio decides to delay the release of a first-run motion picture from one quarter to a subsequent quarter, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the earlier quarter. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing blockbuster films, there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees.
 
In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may affect the demographic base of moviegoers. In certain periods, there are a higher percentage of children’s or animated films that do not generally appeal to our more adult clientele. For example, in 2016, industry reports noted that approximately 50% of industry sales for the Top-15 grossing films were from children’s or animated films (as opposed to 18% of industry sales from 2015’s Top-15 grossing films coming from children’s or animated films). In periods with a higher percentage of children’s or animated films, our results of operations are likely to be materially adversely affected. As a result of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating antitrust, health and sanitation standards, employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Our new theater openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing theaters could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theater level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theater’s jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage, such as those that occurred in 18 states on January 1, 2018, and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
 
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.

We are subject to licensing and regulation, by state and local authorities, relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions. These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety, and immigration, among others. The myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer as different standards apply to different locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements. We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.
 
Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require restaurant companies, such as ours, to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. We do not expect to incur any material costs as a result of complying with these provisions, but cannot anticipate any changes to guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.
 
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of government and industry groups have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws, or any breach of our systems, could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
 
Our theaters that sell alcohol are required to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities, for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our locations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We may decide not to obtain liquor licenses in certain jurisdictions due to the high costs associated with obtaining liquor licenses in such jurisdictions.
 
We are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the respective jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our locations. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material.
 
Our theaters must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations “reasonably accommodate” individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to “commercial facilities” conform to accessibility guidelines unless “structurally impracticable” for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could negatively impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 250 full time and 2,003 part time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our company culture and employee relations to be strong.
