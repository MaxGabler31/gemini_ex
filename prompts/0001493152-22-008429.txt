ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
EVmo was initially formed on June 21, 2016 as a Delaware limited liability company under the name “YayYo, LLC.” The Company was subsequently converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). The Company now operates as a “C” corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
We became a reporting company when, on March 17, 2017, an offering circular on Form 1-A relating to a best-efforts offering of our common stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the “Common Stock”) pursuant to “Regulation A+” of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Then, on November 15, 2019, we completed an initial public offering of 2,625,000 shares of Common Stock, at $4.00 per share, for gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of $10.5 million and our Common Stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “YAYO.”
 
On February 10, 2020, after being advised by Nasdaq that it believed we no longer met the conditions for continued listing, the Company announced its intent to voluntarily delist its Common Stock. Since delisting from Nasdaq, our Common Stock has been quoted and traded on the Pink Open Market, which is operated by OTC Markets Group, under the same ticker symbol. The delisting was effective on March 1, 2020.
 
In September 2020, we changed our name from YayYo, Inc. to Rideshare Rental, Inc., in order for our corporate brand to better reflect our principal businesses, ridesharing and vehicle rentals. In February 2021, we again changed our name to EVmo, Inc., to underscore our commitment to making a full transition to electric vehicles by the end of 2024.
 
Our address is 195 South Robertson Blvd. Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Our telephone number is (310) 926-2643 and our website may be accessed at www.evmo.com.

Overview of the Company
 
EVmo, Inc. is a holding company operating principally through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Rideshare Car Rentals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Rideshare”), and (ii) Distinct Cars, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Distinct Cars”). Rideshare offers an online bookings platform (the “Rideshare Platform”) while Distinct Cars maintains a fleet of passenger vehicles and transit vans for use in the last-mile logistical space for rent to our customers who are drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig industries, while also providing them with insurance coverage and issuing them insurance cards in their own names. This enables such drivers to meet the vehicle suitability and other requirements of rideshare and delivery gig companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Grubhub. Through Rideshare and Distinct Cars, we seek to become a leading provider of rental vehicles to drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig spaces, and an industry leader in supplying transit vans for last-mile logistics. “Gig” generally refers to a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs.
 
Drivers can rent their vehicles using the Rideshare Platform, which enables them to check inventory and performance and review vehicle data. Drivers have the ability to book vehicles online by the day, week or month, at their option, make payments, check insurance, or extend their rental with a minimum of inconvenience, while at the same time incurring no maintenance expenses. Depending on the make and model of the requested vehicle, rental prices begin at $39 per day or $795 per month. The Rideshare Platform is available on desktop, iOS and Android devices. We initially launched the Rideshare Platform in Los Angeles, CA and have since expanded it in the following markets: Oakland, CA; Las Vegas, NV; Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ; Baltimore, MD; and Dallas, TX.
 
In March 2021, we formed another wholly-owned subsidiary, EV Vehicles LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we intend to utilize as the corporate platform to implement our strategy to transition our entire fleet of rental vehicles from standard vehicles with internal combustion engines to electric by 2024.
 
We generate the vast majority of our revenues through the rental of our fleet vehicles. We also receive an immaterial amount of revenue in the form of fees assessed through the Rideshare Platform, such as late fees in the event that a vehicle rental expires without being extended by the driver and the vehicle has not yet been returned, or when the Rideshare Platform is used in a vehicle not owned by us.
 
Our Market
 
We service drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig industries by providing them with qualifying vehicles and insurance, enabling them to work for Transportation Network Companies (“TNCs”) such as Uber and Lyft. We strongly believe this is a vibrant and growing market, as the advent of ridesharing and food delivery gigs over the last decade has permanently changed the transportation industry. The U.S. Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor Statistics in its April 2021 report stated that consumer expenditures on transportation were approximately $1.1 trillion in 2019. Further, according to such statistics, transportation (including vehicle purchases and expenditures for gasoline and motor oil) was the second largest household expenditure after housing and the aggregate consumer spending on transportation was almost twice as large as that of healthcare and three times as large as entertainment. The use of rideshare and food delivery gig applications on smart phones has been transformative, allowing Uber, for example, to announce in mid-2016 that it had completed its two billionth ride only six months after it marked its first one billion rides.
 
One of the challenges the ridesharing and delivery gig industries faces is ensuring that driver growth keeps pace with the massive demand. Lyft recently reported an increase in active riders by over 940,000 in the first quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2020, and that by the end of February 2021 rider growth had exceeded driver growth. Uber had 3.5 million active drivers on its platform during the first three months of the year but is also reporting a shortage. In April 2021, it announced a $250 million stimulus to entice both former and new drivers to work for them.

Accordingly, the TNCs have actively taken steps to satisfy their driver demand by setting up programs designed to get eligible drivers into qualified cars. Uber has entered into multiple partnerships with car rental companies, and Lyft Express Driver is partnered with Hertz. We believe EVmo can be a major independent player in this space, since we also supply TNC drivers with qualifying vehicles, which we expect will eventually be electric vehicles, and provide them access to the Rideshare Platform, which is a driver-friendly mechanism to manage their vehicle rental and allowing them to generate income.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our current growth strategy, which we formulated in early 2021, centers around our goal to transition our entire vehicle fleet to electric vehicles. We initiated this strategy for several reasons. First, we believe that industry trends are clear that electric vehicles will become the mainstay of the automobile market over the next 10 years. The Ford Motor Company has announced its intention to invest more than $30 billion in vehicle electrification through 2025, and has stated that it expects electric vehicles will comprise nearly half of all global sales by 2030. General Motors has stated that its goal is to exclusively sell electric vehicles by 2035. Apple and Hyundai are collaborating on producing an electric vehicle, and industry leader Tesla is rapidly growing and expanding its electric vehicle product line. While, according to LMC Automotive, only 410,000 electric vehicles were built in North America in 2020, annual production is expected to increase to at least 1.4 million vehicles by 2028.
 
Second, we believe that both drivers and riders will be increasingly drawn to electric vehicles for their environmental benefits, especially as they become comparable to combustion cars in terms of pricing, mileage and the number of available options to choose from. The demand for clean energy products is undeniable, and electric vehicles should be no exception as consumers continue to seek out eco-friendly alternatives.
 
Finally, we concluded that governmental policies and mandates will ultimately force the hand of both the automobile industry and consumers. Fuel economy and carbon dioxide emission targets are under constant review by the Environmental Protection Agency and many state governments and, in our opinion, this has helped shape manufacturing strategies and consumer preferences. Several states and municipalities have taken steps to either halt the sales of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the near future, or to promote the sale of electric vehicles. For example, the governor of California issued an executive order in September 2020 requiring all in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks to be zero- emissions by 2035. In Oregon, residents can receive a rebate of up to $2,500 on the purchase or lease of a qualifying electric vehicle.
 
While we will incur a considerable short-term operating expense in turning over our fleet, we firmly believe that the reputational and brand benefits we will realize from being known as a TNC vehicle provider with an entirely electric fleet will quickly allow us to differentiate ourselves and significantly grow our business. The trends we describe above will directly impact the ridesharing and delivery gig industries, as we believe that both TNC drivers and riders will increasingly express a preference for electric vehicles. As an early industry leader in this area, we believe that we will be well-positioned to market ourselves successfully and become profitable, using our current business model of vehicle rentals to TNC drivers. By early in the second quarter of 2022, we expect to have an aggregate of approximately 150 electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles in our fleet, or 25% of the total vehicle fleet. We expect to complete our transition to wholly electric by 2024.
 
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, it characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” In response, numerous states and cities ordered their residents to cease traveling to non-essential jobs and to curtail all unnecessary travel, and similar restrictions were recommended by the federal government. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which saw the initial rapid spread of COVID-19, rideshare companies were severely and negatively impacted, as demand plummeted. Consequently, the Company experienced a decline in revenue during the first half of 2020, which had a negative impact on our cash flows, but we then saw a positive upward movement in revenue during the second half of 2020, which continued through fiscal 2021. This was consistent with the experience of the TNCs whose drivers we service. According to Bloomberg Second Measure, Uber and Lyft sales were up 104% and 84% year-over-year, respectively, in February 2022 from one year earlier, even in spite of the Delta and Omicron variants that resulted in spikes of infections through periods of 2021.
 
Given the current prevalence of FDA-approved eligible vaccines across most age groups, the marked decrease in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the first quarter of 2022, and the resulting easement of pandemic restrictions in our active markets, we are optimistic that COVID-19 will not have a material impact on our operations in the current fiscal year. However, certain factors- including, for example, a new, more aggressive and deadly variant that is resistant to the vaccines- could reverse the positive trends of recent months and alter our prediction.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). As an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | requiring only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with a correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our periodic filings made under the Securities Act; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
● | no non-binding shareholder advisory votes on our executive compensation, including any golden parachute arrangements; and 
● | exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). 

 
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will continue to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of the following: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than $1.07 billion; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements pursuant to SOX and reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” until we have $250 million or more in public float (based on the price of our Common Stock) measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float or a public float that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year.
 
We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this Report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.

Our Business Model and Our Future Opportunities
 
We have developed what we believe is an innovative and effective business model in which we not only provide ridesharing and delivery gig drivers with the necessary technology to operate, through the Rideshare Platform, but also the vehicles themselves, via Distinct Cars, should the driver either not have a qualified vehicle to use or prefers to not use a personal vehicle for this type of work. Our two principal operating subsidiaries have a rare corporate synergy that enables us to both diversify and create complementary revenue streams. Further, as we continue our transition to electric vehicles, we believe we are in the vanguard of a new era in commercial transportation and that our early presence in this industry will further distinguish us from a competitive standpoint.
 
Prior to 2020, we only supplied vehicles to drivers in the ridesharing space but we expanded our service in that year to the delivery gig space, which has provided us with another form of service diversity, one with fewer barriers to entry. The requirements for vehicles operated by delivery gig drivers are significantly less onerous than those operated by rideshare drivers, as delivery gig drivers are not transporting people.
 
The demand for ridesharing in particular plummeted during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some drivers opted not to work in ridesharing during the worst months of the pandemic, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of TNC drivers. Uber, for example, recently reported that it has 3.5 million drivers using its platform, which is twenty-two percent (22%) less than one year earlier, although four percent (4%) higher than in the first quarter of 2021. Both Uber and Lyft have stated that driver growth is not keeping pace with demand and that, as restrictions related to COVID-19 are increasingly being lifted, driver growth is lagging behind rider growth. We believe this increased demand for ridesharing and delivery gig services is producing a commensurate need for qualified vehicles on the road at any given time, which need we are well-positioned to meet.
 
We currently have four priorities: diversifying our revenues by expanding into different markets in North America and continuing our transition to electric vehicles; improving our operating efficiencies, particularly through training our sales force; meeting our customers’ expectations by continuing to provide TNC drivers with quality vehicles and reliable service via the Rideshare Platform; and disciplined capital management, in which our management team allocates our resources effectively.
 
Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC
 
In October 2017, the Company created Rideshare in order to launch the Rideshare Platform, a booking platform developed, coded and wholly-owned by us, and used primarily to rent our Distinct Car vehicles to TNC ridesharing and delivery gig drivers. The Rideshare Platform commercially markets the Distinct Cars fleet (and to a lesser extent the vehicles of other fleet owners and selected individual car owners) to ridesharing and delivery gig drivers. The Company initially launched the Rideshare Platform in Los Angeles, CA and has since expanded it to Oakland, CA; Las Vegas, NV; Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ; Baltimore, MD; and Dallas, TX.
 
The Rideshare Platform’s functionality provides drivers with access to certain data emitted from their respective Distinct Cars rental vehicle(s) through a personal Rideshare dashboard. Vehicle owners can also access and manage data emitted from their personal vehicle(s) under rental to a third-party from the Rideshare Platform inventory dashboard and can further manage the other aspects of the vehicle rental transaction through the Rideshare Platform, including rental extension options. All transactional aspects of the rental vehicle(s) (including, but not limited to, background checks, terms, deposits and insurance costs) are run securely through the Rideshare Platform. In addition, our Rideshare website not only effectively monetizes the Distinct Cars vehicle fleet, but also generates revenue by charging transactional fees to other vehicle owners and ridesharing and delivery gig drivers for all rental transactions consummated on the Rideshare Platform. The Rideshare Platform is available on desktop, iOS and Android devices.
 
Most importantly, all passenger vehicles and transit vans made available on the Rideshare Platform not owned by us are fully qualified by the Company and guaranteed to meet the necessary TNC qualification requirements.
 
Distinct Cars
 
In June 2017, the Company formed Distinct Cars for the purpose of developing a fleet management business to couple with the Rideshare Platform, which was then under development. District Cars maintains a fleet of new standard and, increasingly and ultimately exclusively, electric passenger vehicles and transit vans for the logistical space to be rented directly to drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig economies through the Rideshare Platform. The Company’s fleet of vehicles, under lease contract and maintained by Distinct Cars, as well as other third-party vehicles, have been made commercially available for rental bookings on the Rideshare Platform. Distinct Cars markets and manages short and long-term vehicle rentals to ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers. As of the date of this Report, approximately half of these drivers are located in greater Los Angeles while the other half are located in the other six cities where we have operations.
 
In August 2017, we entered into a leasing arrangement for an initial group of twelve (12) vehicles, with the intent of testing our concept within the ridesharing industry. Following the Company’s proof of concept period, we expanded in December 2017 by adding an additional 135 vehicles to our fleet. As of January 3, 2022, Distinct Cars includes a fleet of approximately 600 vehicles- including standard internal combustion engine and electric passenger vehicles as well as transit vans for the last-mile logistical space- under lease contract. Generally, professional ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers contract for vehicle rental periods ranging from less than three days to six months. The rental vehicles made available to TNC drivers by the Company are configured and guaranteed to be compliant with the same vehicle requirements promulgated by the largest private ridesharing TNCs, Uber and Lyft.
 
The Company believes that customers will rent vehicles offered by Distinct Cars in order to reduce the complexity and cost associated with vehicle ownership, and to guarantee compliance with the TNC vehicle requirements. Depending on the make and model of the requested vehicle, our rental prices begin at $39 per day or $795 per month. Under our full-service rental agreement, the Company provides and fully maintains the vehicle; the services provided include preventive and regular maintenance, advanced diagnostics through our GPS solution software, emergency road service, fleet services, and safety programs, through our Company-operated facilities.
 
Commercial Fleet Purchase Programs
 
In June 2017, the Company commenced purchasing cars pursuant to a fleet purchase arrangement with Hyundai USA, a subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”). The Hyundai arrangement has provided the Company, due to its quantity of cars purchased, with competitive pricing options (or best available pricing) below MSRP on all purchases for brand-new Hyundai vehicles and priority status on the availability and delivery of all Hyundai vehicles under contract with the Company. The vehicle purchases are currently financed by ACME Auto Leasing and LMP Financial Services, with title to the vehicles held by the Company under liens held by the financiers.
 
The Company has since entered into a similar fleet purchase arrangement with Hyundai’s affiliate, Kia Motors America, Inc., and in March 2021 we entered into a separate fleet purchase arrangement with Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”), which is intended to facilitate our strategy to transition to electric vehicles. The terms of each program are standardized according to the number of vehicles purchased in bulk, with each such purchase memorialized in an order submitted by us, and agreed and accepted to by Hyundai, Kia Motors America, Inc. or Tesla, as applicable.
 
Neither partnership is in the form of a supply or requirements contract. We submit, on an as-needed basis, purchase orders for vehicles to Hyundai and now Tesla and these orders are fulfilled on the general terms established at the inception of the partnership program, including below-MSRP pricing.

Vehicle and Driver Requirements
 
We generally impose the same requirements on both drivers and vehicles as those of Uber and Lyft. Any driver who wishes to rent a car from us or use the Rideshare Platform in their own vehicle is screened and evaluated to ensure that he or she:

● | is at least 21 years of age; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | has had an in-state driver’s license for at least one year; 
● | passes a background check, including a clean driving record; and 
● | has or will qualify for in-state auto insurance in their own name. 

 
As noted, each of our Distinct Cars vehicles meets both Uber and Lyft vehicular requirements. If a driver does not rent a vehicle from our fleet we obtain a motor vehicle report for his or her vehicle at the outset of their use of the Rideshare Platform, and renew it every six months. The requirements any vehicle using the Rideshare Platform, whether from Distinct Cars or not, must meet are as follows:
 

● | The vehicle must have four doors and be able to transport a minimum of four passengers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The vehicle model must be 15 years old or newer; 
● | The vehicle’s title cannot be salvaged, reconstructed or rebuilt; and 
● | The vehicle must be in good physical condition with no cosmetic damage, including no missing pieces, commercial branding, or “paint jobs.” 

 
Also, a vehicle used by a ridesharing driver must be able to pass an inspection test, which typically includes headlights, tail-lights, indicator lights, stop lights, foot brakes, emergency/parking brake, steering mechanism, windshield, heat and air conditioning, front, rear and side windows, front seat adjustment mechanism, door controls (open, close, lock), horn, speedometer, body condition/ damage, muffler and exhaust system, condition or tires, interior and exterior rear-view mirrors and safety belts for driver and passengers.
 
Insurance
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company, together with our managing general underwriter, American Business Insurance Services, Inc. (the “MGU”), maintains an insurance policy on behalf of the Company. Under the policy the MGU handles all back-end insurance generation and processing through an application programming interface (API) connection with the Company’s databases. We believe that this MGU insurance policy has made it possible for us to maintain our Rideshare Platform, which allows the Company to have other third-party fleet owners supply vehicles to drivers through our platform and have them covered under the terms of our insurance policy. Our insurance policy provides physical damage and liability coverage to all rideshare drivers under the Rideshare Platform. Under the terms of our policy, both Rideshare Platform drivers acquiring vehicles through Distinct Cars as well as owners of their own vehicles are provided with an insurance ID card that lists each party’s name and the vehicle VIN number. Our Rideshare Platform customers pay daily (for the duration of the rental period) to become designated as a supplemental insured party under the Company’s insurance policy. Under the terms of our policy, insurance coverage is valid from the date of commencement of the rental period up until the date that the vehicle is returned.
 
Further, the Company’s car liability and physical damage insurance policies cover both third-party vehicle owners as well as ridesharing and delivery gig drivers under rental contract. These policies provide insurance on all listed vehicles, provided that the coverage is suspended during periods when the ridesharing driver under rental contract with the Company is actively operating on either the Uber or Lyft platform.

Intellectual Property
 
As of the date of this Report, we have two registered trademarks “YayYo®” and the service mark for a stylized design representing an automobile that is present in our web sites and our marketing materials. We have no applications for other trademarks at present. We have no patents or copyrights.
Human Capital
 
As of the date of this Report, we had approximately 35 full-time employees, all of which are based at our offices. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees generally are good.
Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. In addition to the foregoing, we are also subject to the following:

● | Governmental regulations affect almost every aspect of our business, including the classification of ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers as either independent contractors or employees, the fair treatment of our employees, wage and hour issues, and our financing activities with customers. We could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Federal and state governments in our markets have increasingly placed restrictions and limitations on the vehicles sold in the market in an effort to combat perceived negative environmental effects. For example, in the U.S., vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards which will increase substantially through 2025. Furthermore, numerous states, including California, have adopted or are considering requiring the sale of specified numbers of zero-emission vehicles. Significant increases in fuel economy requirements and new federal or state restrictions on emissions on vehicles and automobile fuels in the U.S. could adversely affect prices of and demand for the new vehicles that we rent; 
● | We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including those governing: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of storage tanks; and the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. In the normal course of our operations we use, generate and dispose of materials covered by these laws and regulations. We face potentially significant costs relating to claims, penalties and remediation efforts in the event of non-compliance with existing and future laws and regulations; and 
● | The Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently evaluating several significant changes to generally accepted accounting standards in the U.S., including the rules governing the accounting for leases. Any such changes could significantly affect our reported financial position, earnings and cash flows. 

 
While we are actively working to mitigate the impact of vehicle-related regulations through our strategy of transitioning our vehicle fleet to electric, until such time as at least the majority of our fleet has switched, we will remain subject to such regulations.
 
Changes in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, automotive retail sales, cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.
 
Competition
 
The market for providing vehicles to TNC drivers is competitive. We believe our principal competitors to be HyreCar, a publicly-traded company that also facilitates the rental of vehicles for use by drivers who work for ridesharing and delivery gig platforms, and Lyft Express, which makes rental vehicles available to Lyft drivers. National car rental companies such as Hertz and Avis also have programs directed at ridesharing and delivery drivers. These companies are all larger and better-resourced than we are at present and have superior market presence and reputation.
 
However, we believe we enjoy a competitive advantage vis-à-vis the above companies through our ability to directly rent cars to our customers from our Distinct Cars fleet and the high functionality of the Rideshare Platform. We also believe that our transition to electric vehicles by 2024 will enhance our brand and further distinguish us from our competitors.
