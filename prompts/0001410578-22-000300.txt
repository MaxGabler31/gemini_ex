Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination with a company in any sector, we intend to focus our search on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses, which complements the expertise of our officers, directors, and advisors. Our sponsor is CHW Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Company History
In January 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,162,500 ordinary shares (our “founder shares”) (after giving effect to a 1.1-for 1 share split we effected on August 30, 2021) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of the initial public offering.
On September 1, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 12,500,000 units (the “units”), including 1,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, and one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “warrant”), with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $125,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement sale of 4,238,636 Warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to the Sponsor, generating total proceeds of $4,238,636. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold in our initial public offering except as otherwise disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-254422 and 333-259182). No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the sale of the private placement warrants. The issuance of the private placement warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
Thirteen qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors which are not affiliated with CHW, the Sponsor, our directors, or any member of our management (the “anchor investors”), each purchased units in the IPO at varying amounts not exceeding 9.9% of the units subject to the IPO. In conjunction with each anchor investor purchasing 100% of the units allocated to it, in connection with the closing of the IPO the Sponsor sold 750,000 founder shares in the aggregate to the anchor investors at their original purchase price.
Furthermore, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement sale of 62,500 ordinary shares (the “Representative Shares”) to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC for nominal consideration. We issued the Representative Shares pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
A total of $125,000,000 comprised of the proceeds from our initial public offering after offering expenses and a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Wilmington Trust, National Association (“Wilmington”) acting as trustee.
Commencing September 24, 2021, holders of the 12,500,000 units sold in the initial public offering may elect to separately trade the ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CHWAU” and the ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “CHWA” and “CHWAW,” respectively.

Proposed Wag! Business Combination
Overview
On February 2, 2022, we entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with CHW Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of CHW (“Merger Sub”), and Wag!, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the business combination of CHW, Merger Sub and Wag! (the “Business Combination”) will be effected. The terms of the Business Combination Agreement, which contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions, termination provisions, and other terms relating to the Business Combination, are summarized below. The combined company’s business will continue to operate through Wag!. Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below are defined in the Business Combination Agreement.
The Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) on the Domestication Closing Date, CHW will domesticate as a Delaware corporation (the “Domestication” and following the Domestication, CHW is referred to herein as “New Wag!”); and (ii) on the Acquisition Closing Date, Merger Sub will merge with and into Wag!, with Wag! surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of New Wag! (the “Acquisition Merger”).
Concurrently with the Domestication, CHW will adopt and file a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which CHW will change its name to Wag! Group Co., and adopt bylaws. At least one business day, but no more than two business days, after the Domestication, and no later than three business days following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Acquisition Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), the Acquisition Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Conversion of Securities
Upon the Domestication Closing, by virtue of the Domestication and without any action on the part of CHW, Merger Sub, Wag!, or the holders of any of CHW’s or Wag!’s securities:

● | each then-outstanding CHW ordinary will be canceled and converted into one share of New Wag! common stock;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding CHW warrant will be assumed and converted automatically into a New Wag! warrant; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding CHW unit will be canceled and converted into one unit of New Wag!, representing one share of New Wag! common stock and one New Wag! warrant.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the Acquisition Closing Date and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of Wag! preferred stock (excluding Series P Preferred Stock of Wag!) will convert automatically into a number of shares of Wag! common stock at the then-effective conversion rate in accordance with the terms of the existing Wag! charter. Each share of Wag! preferred stock (excluding Series P Preferred Stock of Wag!) is expected to convert in connection with the Conversion on a one-for-one basis into a share of Wag! common stock.
At the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and without any action on the part of New Wag!, Merger Sub, Wag!, or the holders of the following securities:

● | each then-outstanding share of Wag! common stock (including shares of Wag! common stock resulting from the Conversion) will be canceled and converted into (a) the right to receive a number of shares of New Wag! common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and (b) the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares as additional consideration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all shares of Wag! common stock and Wag! preferred stock held in the treasury of Wag! will be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding share of Series P Preferred Stock of Wag! shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of New Wag! common stock equal to the Series P Exchange Ratio;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | each then-outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of New Wag! common stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Wag! will issue a number of shares of New Wag! common stock that is less than or equal to 300,000 shares of New Wag! to the persons and in the amounts determined in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement (the “Wag! Community Shares”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Wag! common stock (each, a “Wag! Warrant”) will automatically be assumed and converted into a warrant to purchase a number of shares of New Wag! common stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Wag! common stock subject to such Wag! warrant and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of New Wag! common stock equal to (i) the exercise price per share of such Wag! Warrant divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of Wag! common stock (each, a “Wag! Option”), whether or not vested, will be assumed and converted into (a) an option to purchase a number of shares of New Wag! common stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Wag! common stock subject to such Wag! Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of New Wag! common stock equal to (i) the exercise price per share of such Wag! Option immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (which option will remain subject to the same vesting terms as such Wag! Option) and (b) the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares as additional consideration; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each then-outstanding restricted stock unit award covering shares of Wag! common stock (each, a “Wag! RSU Award”), will be assumed and converted into (a) an award covering a number of shares of New Wag! common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Wag! common stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio (which award will remain subject to the same vesting and repurchase terms as such Wag! RSU Award) and (b) the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares as additional consideration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The “Exchange Ratio” means the following ratio (rounded to ten decimal places): (i) the Company Merger Shares divided by (ii) the Company Outstanding Shares.
The consummation of the proposed Wag! Business Combination is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Business Combination Agreement.
In connection with entering into the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, CHW and certain stockholders of Wag!! (the “Key Wag! Stockholders”) entered into a Lock-Up Agreement (the “Lock-Up Agreement”). Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, approximately 70% of the aggregate issued and outstanding securities of New Wag! will be subject to the restrictions described below from the Acquisition Closing until the termination of applicable lock-up periods.
At the closing of the Business Combination, New Wag!, the Sponsor, certain other shareholders of CHW and certain stockholders of Wag will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, New Wag! will agree that, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Business Combination, it will file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or issuable to the other parties thereto (the “Resale Registration Statement”), and New Wag! will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. In certain circumstances, certain holders can demand up to three underwritten offerings, and certain holders will be entitled to piggyback registration rights.

3



In connection with entering into the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, CHW entered into Subscription Agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with qualified institutional buyers (the “PIPE and Backstop Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE and Backstop Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock of CHW following the Domestication and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger at a cash purchase price of $10.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $5,000,000 million; provided, however, if the PIPE and Backstop Investors acquire shares of common stock of CHW in the open market between the date of the Subscription Agreements and the close of business on the third trading day prior to the special meeting of CHW’s shareholders called in connection with the Business Combination, then the required purchase amount shall be reduced on a share-for-share basis by the number of shares of common stock of CHW so acquired in the open market (the “PIPE and Backstop Investment”).
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, the Sponsor, Mark Grundman and Jonah Raskas (collectively, the “CHW Founder Shareholders”) entered into that certain letter agreement (the “CHW Founders Stock Letter”) with CHW and Wag!, pursuant to which, among other things, CHW, Wag!, and the CHW Founder Shareholders agreed, with respect to 360,750 Founder Shares (as defined below) (the “Forfeiture Shares”), during the period commencing on the date of the Business Combination Agreement and ending on the earlier of (A) the date that is three years after the Acquisition Closing, (B) the date on which the Forfeiture Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture, (C) subsequent to the Acquisition Closing, the consummation of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the New Wag! stockholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, and (D) the valid termination of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor will not to (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to, any Forfeiture Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Forfeiture Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clauses (i) or (ii), subject to certain exceptions.
Wag! has delivered to CHW the Stockholder Support Agreement, dated February 2, 2022 (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Key Wag! Stockholders, whose ownership interests collectively represent the outstanding Wag! common stock and Wag! preferred stock (voting on an as-converted basis) sufficient to approve the Business Combination on behalf of Wag!, will agree to support the approval and adoption of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, including agreeing to execute and deliver the requisite consent of Wag!’s stockholders holding shares of Wag! common stock and Wag! preferred stock sufficient under the Delaware General Corporation Law and Wag!’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws to approve the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination, in the form of a written consent executed by the Key Wag! Stockholders, within 48 hours of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC in connection with the Business Combination becoming effective. The Stockholder Support Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, (b) the date of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, and (c) the effective date of a written agreement of CHW, Wag!, and the Wag! stockholders party thereto terminating the Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Expiration Time”). The Key Wag! Stockholders also agreed, until the Expiration Time, to certain transfer restrictions (excluding the Conversion).
In connection with entering into the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, CHW entered into a definitive commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Blue Torch Capital LP (together with its affiliated funds and any other parties providing a commitment thereunder, including any additional lenders, agents, arrangers or other parties joined thereto after the date thereof, collectively, the “Debt Financing Sources”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Debt Financing Sources agreed to fund a $30 million senior secured term loan credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The closing and funding of the Credit Facility will occur in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to funding set forth in the Commitment Letter. Upon closing, Wag! will be the primary borrower under the Credit Facility, New Wag! will be a parent guarantor and substantially all of Wag!’s existing and future subsidiaries will be subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain customary exceptions). The Credit Facility will be secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets of Wag! and the guarantors (subject to certain customary exceptions).

The Business Combination Agreement, Lock-Up Agreement, Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, Subscription Agreement, CHW Founders Stock Letter, Stockholder Support Agreement and Commitment Letter (the “Included Agreements”) have been included to provide investors with information regarding their terms. They are not intended to provide any other factual information about CHW, Wag! or their affiliates. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in each Included Agreement and the other documents related thereto were made only for purposes of such Included Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such Included Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Included Agreements instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Included Agreements and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Included Agreements, as applicable, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the our public disclosures.
For more information about the Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Wag! Business Combination, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 3, 2022 and the Wag! Disclosure Statement that we will file with the SEC. Unless specifically stated, this Annual Report does not give effect to the proposed Wag! Business Combination and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed Wag! Business Combination. Such risks and effects relating to the proposed Wag! Business Combination will be included in a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that we will file with the SEC relating to our proposed business combination with Wag!
Additional Disclosures
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
Our executive offices are located at 2 Manhattanville Road, Suite 403, Purchase, NY 10577, and our telephone number is (914) 603-5016.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

6



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our redeemable ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates did not exceed $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues did not exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates did not exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, (i) meetings with incumbent management and their advisors (if applicable); (ii) document reviews; (iii) interviews with various stakeholders, including, but not limited to, employees, customers and suppliers; (iv) on-site inspection of facilities; and (v) reviewing financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Conflicts of Interest
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and in the future any of our officers and directors may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, no director or officer shall be disqualified or prevented from contracting with the company nor shall any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the company in which any director shall have an interest be liable to be avoided. A director shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of such interest shall be disclosed at or prior to its consideration or any vote thereon by the board of directors. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors would materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Human Capital Management
We currently have four executive officers and we do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the status of the proposed Wag! business combination and, if the proposed Wag! business combination is not consummated, whether a different target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

CHW ACQUISTION CORPNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2021
Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations and Liquidity
CHW Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”, “CHW”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 12, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity from January 12, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s formation and initial public offering (“IPO”), which is described below, and, since the offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income earned on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on August 30, 2021. On September 1, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 11,000,000 units (the “Units”) with respect to the ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) included in the units being offered (the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds of $110,000,000, which is discussed in Note 3.Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 4,000,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Company’s sponsor, CHW Acquisition Sponsor, LLC and underwriters generating gross proceeds of $4,000,000, which is described in Note 4.On August 30, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise their over-allotment option and partially exercised 1,500,000 Units and the remaining Units went un-exercised on expiry of 45 days. Accordingly, on September 1, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,500,000 Units to the public, at $10.00 per Unit, and the sale of an additional 238,636 Private Placement Warrants, at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrants, generating total gross proceeds of $15,238,636.Offering costs for the IPO and underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option amounted to $13,130,743, consisting of $2,187,500 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)), $5,975,625 for the fair value of shares issued to the anchor investors and representative shares (see Note 3 and Note 6) and $592,618 of other costs. As described in Note 6, the $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the consummation of a Business Combination by December 1, 2022, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.Following the closing of the IPO on September 1, 2021, an amount of $125,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) and will be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target 

F-6



or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights with respect to the Company’s warrants.All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company’s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”). In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of the Public Shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Public Shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement will be treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital). While redemptions cannot cause the Company’s net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Public Shares are redeemable and will be classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place.Redemptions of the Company’s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Company’s Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or share exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or share exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or share exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, the Company will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company’s legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.

F-7



Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Ordinary shares sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company.The Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Shareholders”) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 1, 2022, 15 months from the closing of the IPO (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.The Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to its deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per-share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.00 per shares held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business execute agreements waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.Risks and UncertaintiesIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. As of the date the financial statements were issued, there was considerable uncertainty around the expected duration of this pandemic. Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that COVID-19 could have a negative effect on closing a Business Combination, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-8



Liquidity and Going ConcernAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $687,581 in its operating bank accounts, $125,002,997 in securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its Ordinary Shares in connection therewith and working capital of $459,528. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $3,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income.Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
​
Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.Emerging Growth CompanyThe Company is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 102 (b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), which exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-9



Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021.Investments Held in Trust Account
At December 31, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury securities. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available market information.Offering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering
Offering costs, including additional underwriting fees associated with the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option, consist principally of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs directly related to the IPO. Offering costs for the IPO and underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option amounted to $13,130,743, consisting of $2,187,500 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable, $5,975,625 for the fair value of shares issued to the anchor investors and representative shares and $592,618 of other costs.Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. At December 31, 2021, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the (“FASB”) ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were deemed to be de minimis as of December 31, 2021.FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company’s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company is not currently aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. There is currently no taxation imposed by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

F-10



The Company has no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements.Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
The Company accounts for its Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption, if any, are classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Ordinary Shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Public Shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, 12,500,000 shares of Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.
At December 31, 2021, the redeemable ordinary share subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheet is reconciled in the following table:

Net Loss per Ordinary ShareThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Redeemable Ordinary Shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) and Non-Redeemable Ordinary Shares (the “Founder Shares”). Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Public and private warrants to purchase 16,738,636 Ordinary Shares at $11.50 per share were issued on September 1, 2021. At December 31, 2021, no warrants have been exercised. The 16,738,636 potential Ordinary shares for outstanding warrants to purchase the Company’s stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the period ended December 31, 2021 because the warrants are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. As a result, diluted net income/(loss) per common share is the same as basic net income/(loss) per common share for the period. The table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share for each class of ordinary share.​

Accounting for Warrants
The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the instruments are free standing financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the Company’s own common shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, was conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Management has concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 12, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statement. The Company's management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statement

Note 3 — Initial Public Offering and Over-AllotmentPursuant to the IPO, the Company sold 11,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per Unit for aggregate purchase price of $110,000,000. Each Unit consists of one Ordinary shares (such shares of Ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), and one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).Thirteen qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors which are not affiliated with the Company, the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, or any member of the Company’s management (the “anchor investors”), have each purchased units in the IPO at varying amounts not exceeding 9.9% of the units subject to the IPO. Upon each anchor investor purchasing the full amount of Units it had expressed an interest in, the anchor investors collectively own approximately 11% of the outstanding shares following the IPO, which includes the Founder Shares purchased by the anchor investors, and the Sponsor owns approximately 19% of the outstanding shares following the IPO (see Note 5).On August 30, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise their over-allotment option and partially exercised 1,500,000 Units and the remaining Units went un-exercised on expiry of 45 days. Accordingly, on September 1, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,500,000 Units to the public, at $10.00 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000.
Note 4 — Private Placement WarrantsConcurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor and underwriter purchased an aggregate of 4,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole share of Ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). The proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants at the IPO are held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.

F-12



On August 30, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise their over-allotment option and partially exercised 1,500,000 Units and the remaining Units went un-exercised on expiry of 45 days. On September 1, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 238,636 Private Placement Warrants, at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $238,636.


Note 5 — Related Party TransactionsFounder Shares
On January 18, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 in exchange for 2,875,000 ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”). On August 30, 2021, the Company effectuated a 1.1-for-1 share split, resulting in an aggregate of 3,162,500 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 412,500 ordinary shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ overallotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the IPO.On August 30, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise their over-allotment option and partially exercised 1,500,000 Units and the remaining Units went un-exercised on expiry of 45 days. As such, on September 1, 2021, the Sponsor forfeited 37,500 ordinary shares for no consideration.The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earliest of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of the shares of Ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Public Stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property.In conjunction with each anchor investor purchasing 100% of the Units allocated to it, in connection with the closing of the IPO the Sponsor sold 60,000 Founder Shares (or 30,000 Founder Shares, as applicable) to each anchor investor (750,000 founder shares in the aggregate) at their original purchase price totalling to $6,750; provided, however, that in the event that an anchor investor sells any of Units or Ordinary Shares purchased in the IPO within 30 days following the closing of the IPO, the number of Founder Shares transferred to such anchor investor would be reduced to 50,000 Founder Shares (or 25,000 Founder Shares, as applicable). The Company estimated the excess aggregate fair value over the amount paid by the anchor investors of the Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investors to be $5,515,500, or $7.362 per share. The excess of the fair value of the Founder Shares over the purchase price of $6,750 was determined to be a contribution to the Company from the founders in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)Topic 5T and an offering cost in accordance with SAB Topic 5A. Accordingly, the offering cost were recorded against additional paid in capital in accordance with the accounting of other offering costs. Please see Note 9 for valuation methodology and assumptions of the Founder Shares.Promissory Note — Related Party
On January 18, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. As of December 31, 2021, there was no amount outstanding under the Promissory Note.Related Party Loans
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company may repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into 

F-13



warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.Due from related partyAs of December 31, 2021, the Sponsor held $68,591 from the closing of the IPO that will be deposited as soon as practical from the Company’s operating account.Administrative Services Fee
The Company entered into an agreement, commencing on the effective date of the IPO through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination and the Company’s liquidation, to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial and administrative services. As of December 31, 2021, $40,000 has been paid under this arrangement.
Note 6 — Commitments and ContingenciesRegistration Rights
The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, are entitled to registration rights (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion of such shares to shares of Ordinary shares) pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated September 1, 2021. These holders are entitled to certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.Underwriting Agreement
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the final prospectus relating to the IPO to purchase up to 1,650,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.On August 30, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise their over-allotment option and partially exercised 1,500,000 Units and the remaining Units went un-exercised on expiry of 45 days. Accordingly, on September 1, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,500,000 Units to the public, at $10.00 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000.The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.175 per unit, or $2,187,500 in the aggregate at the closing of the IPO (which includes amounts related to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option). In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commissions of $0.35 per unit, or $4,375,000 in the aggregate from the closing of the IPO ((which includes amounts related to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.Representative SharesIn September 2021, the Company issued to the designees of the underwriter 62,500 ordinary shares (the “Representative Shares”). The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an offering cost of the IPO, with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity. The Company estimated the fair value of the Representative Shares to be $7.362 per share ($460,125 in the aggregate) based upon the price of the Founder Shares issued to the anchor investors (see Note 5). The holders of the Representative Shares have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have agreed (i) to waive their conversion rights (or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.Please see Note 9 for valuation methodology and assumptions of the Representative Shares.

Note 7 - Shareholders’ DeficitPreference Shares—The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. At December 31, 2021, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding.Ordinary shares — The Company is authorized to issue 110,000,000 shares of Founder Shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2021, there were 3,187,500 shares of Ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 12,500,000 shares subject to redemption) and after giving affect to the forfeiture of 37,500 Ordinary shares since the underwriters’ did not exercise of the over-allotment option. 
​
Note 8 - WarrantsPublic Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the completion of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the IPO. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.The Company will not be obligated to deliver any ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available.The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file, and within 60 business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the warrants:
● | in whole and not in part;
--+--------------------------


● | at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
--+---------------------------------


● | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, to each warrant holder; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Public Shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share consolidations, share capitalizations, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F-15



If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification.If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.50 per Public Share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.50 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $16.50 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable, or saleable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions.The Company has determined that warrants issued in connection with its IPO in September 2021 are subject to treatment as equity. In order to account for the fair value the public warrants on IPO, the Company used Black Scholes Model to allocate cost to Public warrants on IPO. The key assumptions in the option pricing model utilized are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected volatility as of the IPO Closing Date was derived from observable public warrant pricing on comparable 'blank check' companies that recently went public in 2020 and 2021. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interpolated U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield. The expected term of the warrants is assumed to be six months until the close of a Business Combination, and the contractual five-year term subsequently. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.The following table provides quantitative information regarding fair value measurements at issuance on September 1, 2021.​

Note 9 — Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:Level 1:Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.Level 2:Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.Level 3:Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.At December 31, 2021, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in treasury funds. All of the Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities.​
The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.​

​
The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Founder and Representative Shares at issuance. The estimated fair value of the shares is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Monte Carlo pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity in line with the timing of the and likelihood of completing a business combination. The common stock price was assumed to fluctuate with the Company projected volatility based on comparable public companies. The term was simulated based on managements assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of completing a business combination.The following table provides quantitative information the founder share valuation.​

The Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) on the Domestication Closing Date, CHW will domesticate as a Delaware corporation; and (ii) on the Acquisition Closing Date, Merger Sub will merge with and into Wag, with Wag surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of New Wag.Concurrently with the Domestication, CHW will adopt and file a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which CHW will change its name to Wag! Group Co. and adopt bylaws. At least one business day, but no more than two business days, after the Domestication, and no later than three business days following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Acquisition Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), the Acquisition Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.In connection with entering into the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, CHW entered into Subscription Agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with qualified institutional buyers (the “PIPE and Backstop Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE and Backstop Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock of CHW following the Domestication and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger at a cash purchase price of $10.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $5,000,000 million; provided, however, if the PIPE and Backstop Investors acquire shares of common stock of CHW in the open market between the date of the Subscription Agreements and the close of business on the third trading day prior to the special meeting of CHW’s shareholders called in connection with the Business Combination, then the required purchase amount shall be reduced on a share-for-share basis by the number of shares of common stock of CHW so acquired in the open market (the “PIPE and Backstop Investment”).In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on February 2, 2022, the Sponsor, Mark Grundman and Jonah Raskas (collectively, the “CHW Founder Shareholders”) entered into that certain letter agreement (the “CHW Founders Stock Letter”) with CHW and Wag!, pursuant to which, among other things, CHW, Wag!, and the CHW Founder Shareholders agreed, with respect to 360,750 Founder Shares (as defined below) (the “Forfeiture Shares”), during the period commencing on the date of the Business Combination Agreement and ending on the earlier of (A) the date that is three years after the Acquisition Closing, (B) the date on which the Forfeiture Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture, (C) subsequent to the Acquisition Closing, the consummation of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the New Wag! stockholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, and (D) the valid termination of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor will not to (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to, any Forfeiture Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Forfeiture Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clauses (i) or (ii), subject to certain exceptions.Wag! has delivered to CHW the Stockholder Support Agreement, dated February 2, 2022 (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Key Wag!
