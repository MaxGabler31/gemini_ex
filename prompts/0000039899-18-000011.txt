ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are an innovative media company that serves the greater good of our communities - through empowering stories, impactful investigations and innovative marketing services. With 47 television stations in 39 U.S. markets, we are the largest owner of big four network affiliates in the top 25 markets, reaching approximately one-third of all television households nationwide. Each television station also has a robust digital presence across online, mobile and social platforms, reaching consumers whenever, wherever they are. Each month, we reach 50 million consumers on-air and approximately 35 million across our digital platforms. We have been consistently honored with the industry’s top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. Beyond integrated broadcast advertising products and services, we deliver results for advertisers through innovative solutions including our Over the Top (OTT) local advertising network, Premion; and our digital marketing services (DMS) business, a one-stop shop for local businesses to connect with consumers through digital marketing.
All of this is now delivered through a company with one singular focus; in 2017, we completed our transformation into a pure-play media company. On May 31, 2017 we successfully completed the spin-off of Cars.com into a separate stand-alone public company and on July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our controlling ownership interest in CareerBuilder. The completion of these strategic actions has reduced our debt and has further strengthened our balance sheet, providing us the ability to invest in our media businesses, capitalizing on opportunities for organic and acquisition-related growth. Our media operations generate strong and dependable cash flows and we are financially disciplined, which allows us to return additional value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are a leader in embracing change and driving innovation across our businesses, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the evolving regulatory environment.
Operating Structure
After completing these strategic actions, we now have one operating and reportable segment which generated revenues of $1.9 billion in 2017. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) advertising & marketing services revenues, which include local and national non-political advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on the stations’ websites and tablet and mobile products; 2) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g. 2018, 2016) and particularly in the second half of those years; 3) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; and 4) other services, such as production of programming from third parties and production of advertising material.
The advertising revenues generated by a station’s local news programs make up a significant part of its total advertising revenues. Advertising pricing is influenced by demand for advertising time. This demand is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and demographics of the local populations, the concentration of businesses, local economic conditions, and the popularity or ratings of the station’s programming. Almost all national advertising is placed through independent advertising representatives, while local advertising time is sold by each station’s own sales force.
Our portfolio of NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX stations operate under long-term affiliation agreements. Generally, a network provides programs to its affiliated television stations and the network sells commercial advertising for certain of the available advertising spots within the network programs, while our television stations sell the remaining available commercial advertising spots. Our television stations also produce local programming such as news, sports, and entertainment.
Broadcast affiliates and their network partners continue to have the broadest appeal in terms of household viewership, viewing time and audience reach. The overall reach of events such as the Olympics and NFL Football, along with our extensive local news and non-news programming, continues to surpass the reach in viewership of individual cable channels. Our ratings and reach are driven by the quality of programs we and our network partners produce and by the strong local connections we have to our communities, which gives us a unique position among the numerous program choices viewers have, regardless of platform.
Strategy
Our Board of Directors actively and regularly reviews, guides and oversees the development and implementation of our long-term strategic plan to create value for our stakeholders. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 
Continue to innovate in our content offerings to our consumers. Our trusted, local content is the driver of our success across all distribution channels and is a key ingredient that powers our current and future revenues. Our scale has allowed us to invest in comprehensive content and digital innovation initiatives. Our focus on data-driven editorial processes, new storytelling formats, and unique visual presentations across all our platforms are helping to make our content the consumers’ first choice, no matter the platform.

In 2017, we continued significant efforts to embrace change, transform our content and connect with audiences in unique and powerful ways. Our culture encourages and embraces bold thinking and innovative ideas from across the company. We are creating unique, live and original content in news and non-news time periods to meet changing viewer habits. In an on-demand OTT world, live, locally-relevant content is becoming far more important than it was in the past, and we are acting on that trend. We have continued to make wholesale transformations of our local news operations. We have invested in true digital-first newsrooms, leveraging analytics to better serve audiences and clients on-air and via mobile devices.
We are recognized nationally for our innovation in reinventing local journalism in the digital age. Over the past year, we have conducted digital-first investigations that shined a light on important issues, holding the powerful accountable and helping drive change and results for those without a voice. Projects like “Verify,” which provides unbiased fact-checking on a variety of topics, developed before ‘fake news’ entered the common vernacular, was rolled out across all markets in 2017. “Verify” segments are platform agnostic and air on broadcast channels, are posted to social media channels and are shared across desktop, digital and mobile apps. Other impactful digital-first investigations such as “Selling Girls,” a six-part series produced by the award-winning investigative news teams from 11Alive in Atlanta and KHOU in Houston, focused on trafficking of American minor children. Initially launched across stations’ digital platforms, the series was localized, highlighting the direct impact of child sex trafficking in specific communities across the U.S. 
In 2017, we launched innovative, multi-platform, non-news programs, replacing the syndicated programs in these timeslots. These programs are produced at our local stations, reducing cost while allowing us to quickly respond to local needs and tastes in content. We premiered “Daily Blast LIVE,” a groundbreaking 30-minute live news and entertainment show produced out of KUSA in Denver. “Daily Blast LIVE” is a first-of-its-kind format that is live in every time zone across 35 TEGNA markets, something unprecedented in TV syndication, and is also available on Facebook and YouTube. The content on “Daily Blast LIVE” is always live and crowdsourced in real-time from viewers though social media. We also debuted “Sister Circle,” a new live daily talk show that targets African-American women - a large and traditionally underserved audience. Produced by WATL in Atlanta, “Sister Circle” reaches 60 percent of U.S. television households, distributed across 12 TEGNA markets and on TV One, a cable network offering a broad range of programming for a diverse audience of adult African-American viewers. We also introduced “Sing Like A Star,” a singing competition program produced by WWL in New Orleans that now airs in 34 markets. 
Increase engagement across all platforms. In 2017, we took several important steps to enhance the user experience across digital products, creating a more efficient digital publishing organization and laying the foundation for more diverse revenue streams.

• | We launched HeartThreads, our first digital content vertical play capitalizing on the human-interest content produced by our stations formatted to fit the needs of social audiences. We expect to continue launching additional digital content verticals in 2018.


• | We completed a redesign of our mobile websites, and as a result have seen increases in content consumption, video views, loyalty and ad impressions. We also launched a redesign of our desktop sites starting in the fourth quarter of 2017, which we expect to have completed across all of our stations in early 2018.


• | We created a central content team to cover stories of national importance, allowing our stations to focus on winning their local markets. As a result, we have been able to drive significant digital traffic around major national news events happening outside of our markets, while stations have been able to reduce digital story output but maintain or increase traffic levels.


• | We initiated efforts to further increase engagement with our audience on additional digital platforms, including revamped email products, search optimization and new experiences for voice assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa.

As a result of these efforts, pages per visitor in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew by 23% compared to the prior year quarter, and for the year total monetizable video plays increased 41%, and our social media interactions across platforms grew by 24% from 2016.
Grow subscription revenue. Subscription revenue has steadily increased in the last several years, better reflecting the value of the content that our business provides. Pursuant to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, every three years a local television station must elect to either (1) require cable and/or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the station’s signal or (2) require such cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to secure carriage. At present, we have retransmission consent agreements with almost all cable operators and satellite providers for carriage of our television stations. We also have retransmission agreements with major telecommunications companies. Our scale and strength in local content has contributed to our ability to grow our subscription revenue beyond traditional multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) into the growing OTT space as well. 
Our market affiliates are also pivotal to the success of companies offering platforms in the OTT space. In late 2017, we closed large OTT distribution deals with major network partners and streaming services like YouTube TV and Direct TV Now, permitting them to carry our stations’ content. Our negotiations with these providers reinforced how critical strong broadcast affiliates are to any OTT service. Because our stations serve large markets that are pivotal to the success of companies offering 
4

platforms in the OTT space, we have negotiated favorable agreements with economics that are as good or better with new OTT entrants than with traditional MVPDs, making us economically agnostic to consumer platform choices. 
The additional benefit of moving our content onto OTT platforms is that it allows us to reach customers through additional platforms, increasing our exposure to an additional demographic of newer viewers that had previously consumed less of our product nor paid subscriber revenues to us. 
Improve the value we bring to advertisers. We continued to expand market share through our sales transformation efforts, including innovations like Hatch, our centralized 360-degree marketing services agency, our centralized pricing platform, and a well trained, solutions-oriented salesforce. We provide our clients with data-driven integrated marketing services, a holistic approach to put their advertising dollars to work in the channels that make the most sense for them, regardless of the platform. We serve our clients by providing deep consumer insights, unique creative solutions, and customization. To that end, in 2017 we rolled out a sophisticated pricing platform that marries disparate data sets and other advanced technologies to provide more optimal predictive pricing insights both for our salesforce and, ultimately, for our advertising clients. This software will also allow us to play a pivotal role as the industry shifts to more automated buying platforms. 
Late in 2016, we launched the industry’s first OTT local advertising network, Premion, which is unparalleled in the industry. Premion is a one-stop-shop that allows local, regional and national customers to place advertising on long-form programs across a broad array of services such as streaming devices, smart TVs and web browsers. Premion is a highly desirable buy for advertisers trying to reach cord cutters, and is helping us expand our revenue base and giving us access to new markets. Our large, local salesforce is leveraging relationships with local and regional advertisers to sell Premion inventory. Premion’s revenue in 2017 was just over $30.0 million compared to $0.6 million in 2016. 
Invest in new growth initiatives. We are further diversifying our revenue base by investing in new business models that leverage our strong assets and scale. 

• | Intelligent Ad Automation. Premion has been our first investment in intelligent ad automation. Premion has created a technology platform to aggregate inventory from OTT providers and then resell the inventory to local and regional advertisers leveraging our salesforce. Building on the success of that business in 2017, Premion will be launching a Data Management Platform (DMP) in 2018 to help agencies and publishers better target the highly coveted OTT audiences.

In addition to Premion, we are working to accelerate the automation of national spot advertising. In 2017, we teamed with several other broadcasters to create a set of Application Programming Interface’s (API’s) to enable software companies to more easily enter the market and work with the broader ecosystem. In 2018, we will continue to seek additional investment opportunities in this space.

• | Performance Marketing. We are a leading provider of digital marketing services for advertisers. We have continued to evolve our product offerings in 2017 with launches of new services such as email with social amplification which ties together the traditional email marketing product and social advertising to provide effective results for our advertisers. We have also invested in several successful attribution pilots, more effectively demonstrating the value all our advertising products bring to our clients.


• | ATSC 3.0. In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission began the process to issue rules that would give permission to broadcast in the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast transmissions standard, which will allow broadcasters to enhance their existing transmission services with a new standardized system that will allow us to compete directly with Internet IP protocols. This new standard will allow us to support higher 4K high dynamic range resolution, higher frame rate, mobile, second screen experiences, 3D audio, virtual reality, advanced advertising and other exciting enhancements to the viewing experience. The service enables encryption and content protection which will allow broadcasters for the first time to protect their signal and employ paywalls. We expect to roll out ATSC 3.0 pending the completion of the new standard in coordination with upgrades related to our spectrum repack transition.

Capitalize on opportunities to grow inorganically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation enables us to opportunistically grow the business through acquisitions. We believe that we are well-positioned to participate in a changing media landscape. For example, our 47 television stations (excluding the station we currently service under a services arrangement) reach 28% of U.S. television households when the UHF discount is applied, well below the 39% ownership cap which gives us ample headroom to pursue large vertical consolidations and other opportunities as we have done in the past. We also see accretive in-market consolidation opportunities within our existing footprint, where we have strong stations and mediums in large markets.

On February 15, 2018, we acquired, for approximately $325 million in cash, assets in San Diego consisting of KFMB-TV, the CBS affiliated station, KFMB-D2 (CW channel) and radio broadcast stations KFMB-AM and KFMB-FM. Through this transaction, we added a strong market to our portfolio. San Diego is the 29th largest U.S. TV market with 1.1 million households and the 17th largest radio market. KFMB-TV is the long-standing market leader in San Diego. It leads the market in audience ratings and share across all demographics and is number one in news across all major time slots. As a result of this acquisition, our U.S. television household reach increased by more than one million or one percentage point. 
Competition
Our company competes for audience share and advertising revenues primarily with other local television broadcasters (including network-affiliated and independent) and with other advertising media, such as radio broadcasters, MVPDs, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and Internet media. Other sources of competition for our media stations include home video and audio recorders and players, direct broadcast satellite, low power television, Internet radio, video offerings (both wire line and wireless) of telephone companies as well as developing video services. Within their respective Designated Market Area (DMA), our stations compete for audience share and audience composition which is largely driven by program popularity. Our share of the DMA has a direct effect on the rates we are able to charge advertisers. MVPDs can also increase competition by bringing additional cable network channels and content into the DMA.
The advertising industry is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Our stations compete in the emerging local electronic media space, which includes the Internet or Internet-enabled devices, handheld wireless devices such as mobile phones and tablets, social media platforms, digital spectrum opportunities and OTT. The technology that enables consumers to receive news and information continues to evolve.
Regulation
Our television stations are operated under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission), the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and the rules and policies of the FCC (FCC regulations). As a result, our television stations are subject to a variety of obligations, such as restrictions on the broadcast of material deemed “indecent” or “profane,” requirements to provide or pass through closed captioning for most programming, rules requiring the public disclosure of certain information about our stations’ operations, and the obligation to offer programming responsive to the needs and interests of our stations’ communities. The FCC may alter or add to these requirements, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business. Certain significant elements of the FCC’s current regulatory framework for broadcast television are described in further detail below.
Television broadcast licenses generally are granted for eight year periods. They are renewable upon application to the FCC and usually are renewed except in rare cases in which a petition to deny, a complaint or an adverse finding as to the licensee’s qualifications results in loss of the license. We believe that our stations operate in substantial compliance with the Communications Act and FCC regulations.
FCC regulations limit the concentration of broadcasting control and regulate network and local programming practices. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order altering its regulations governing media ownership, generally making these regulations less restrictive. For example, the order eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which generally prohibited an entity from holding an ownership interest in a daily print newspaper and a full-power broadcast station within the same market, and the television/radio cross-ownership rule, which imposed a number of limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market. Under the revised FCC regulations that took effect on February 7, 2018, common ownership of two television stations in the same market will be permitted so long as at least one of the commonly owned stations is not among the top four rated stations in the market at the time of acquisition. Such transactions no longer will be subject to the “Eight Voices Test,” which required applicants seeking to acquire a second television station in a market to show that at least eight independently owned television stations would remain after the acquisition. Applications seeking FCC consent for a party to acquire control of two top four rated television stations in the same market will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The November 2017 ownership order also eliminated a rule making certain joint advertising sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. Various parties - including cable operators and other advocates for more stringent broadcast ownership restrictions - opposed these and other changes adopted in the November 2017 order and have challenged the order in court. The FCC will continue to require the disclosure of shared services agreements (SSAs) in stations’ online public inspection files, though these agreements generally are not deemed to be attributable ownership interests. The FCC defines SSAs broadly to include a wide range of agreements between separately owned stations, including news sharing agreements and other agreements involving “station-related services.” We are party to a transition services agreement (which is similar to, but more limited than, the typical shared services agreement) and a JSA with a third party that owns a television station in Tucson, where we also own a television station. We are not party to any other JSAs. We are party to agreements in several other markets involving the limited sharing of certain equipment and resources; some of these agreements may qualify as SSAs subject to disclosure. 
The Communications Act includes a national ownership cap for broadcast television stations that prohibits any one person or entity from having, in the aggregate, market reach of more than 39% of all U.S. television households. FCC regulations permit 
6

stations to discount the market reach of stations that broadcast on UHF channels by 50% (the UHF discount), though the FCC’s decision in early 2017 to reinstate the UHF discount (reversing an earlier order that would have repealed the discount) has been challenged in court. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comments on whether it can or should modify or eliminate the national ownership cap and/or the UHF discount. Our 47 television stations (excluding the station we currently service under a services arrangement) reach approximately 28% of U.S. television households when the UHF discount is applied and approximately 33% without the UHF discount. 
As permitted by the Communications Act and FCC rules, we require cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to retransmit our stations’ signals. Under the applicable statutory provisions and FCC rules, such negotiations must be conducted in “good faith.” FCC rules also provide stations with certain protections against cable and satellite operators importing duplicating network or syndicated programming broadcast by distant stations. Pay-TV interests and other parties continue to advocate for the FCC to alter or eliminate various aspects of the rules governing retransmission consent negotiations and stations’ exclusivity rights. If such changes were adopted, they could give cable and satellite operators leverage against broadcasters in retransmission consent negotiations and, as a result, adversely impact our revenue from retransmission and advertising.
In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of a voluntary incentive auction to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, along with a related “repacking” of the television spectrum for remaining television stations. None of our stations will relinquish any spectrum rights as a result of the auction, and accordingly we will not receive any incentive auction proceeds. The repacking requires that certain television stations move to different channels, and some stations may have smaller service areas and/or experience additional interference. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction and repacking establishes a $1.75 billion fund for reimbursement of costs incurred by stations required to change channels in the repacking. The FCC has notified us that 13 of our stations will be repacked to new channels. We estimate that we will incur approximately $34.0 million in capital expenditures associated with the repack of our 13 stations, of which approximately $19.0 million will be incurred in 2018. While we are eligible to seek reimbursement for costs associated with implementing these changes, the FCC has announced that aggregate reimbursement estimates from all eligible entities, after review and adjustment by the FCC’s reimbursement fund administrator, total $1.864 billion, or approximately $114 million more than is currently statutorily authorized for such reimbursements. Each repacked commercial television station, including each of our 13 repacked stations, has been allocated an initial reimbursement amount equal to approximately 52 percent of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator. Particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs incurred are subject to further FCC review and approval. Further reimbursement allocations will depend on the amount of funds actually drawn from the FCC’s reimbursement fund and whether any additional reimbursement funding is made available by Congress. We also own various low-power television stations, which are not entitled to repacking protection, some of which have been or will be displaced. Any such displaced low-power stations either would need to cease operations or be relocated to a new channel (if one is available) at our expense. It is still too early to assess the ultimate impact of the incentive auction and repacking upon our business, as this impact will depend upon numerous factors, including the actual operational effects of the channel changes implemented in the repacking and the degree to which our repacked stations are reimbursed. 
In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard makes possible a variety of benefits for both broadcasters and viewers, including better sound and picture quality, hyper-localized programming including news and weather, enhanced emergency alerts, improved mobile reception, the use of targeted advertising, and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same 6 megahertz channel. However, ATSC 3.0 is not backwards compatible with existing television equipment. To ensure continued service to all viewers, the FCC’s order authorizing ATSC 3.0 operations requires full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. The content of this simulcast signal must be substantially similar to the programming aired on the ATSC 3.0 channel for a period of at least five years. Transitioning a station to ATSC 3.0 is voluntary under current FCC rules and may require significant expenditures. We are evaluating potential ATSC 3.0 roll out plans, pending completion of the standard and coordination with repacking-related changes. In the event we elect to offer ATSC 3.0 service on any of our stations, there can be no guarantee that such service would earn sufficient additional revenues to offset the related expenditures. 
General Company Information
Our company was founded by Frank E. Gannett and associates in 1906 and was incorporated in 1923. We listed shares publicly for the first time in 1967 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1972. In June 2015, we completed the spin-off of our former publishing businesses, and our company was renamed TEGNA. In addition, in May 2017, we completed the spin-off of our digital automotive business, Cars.com, and in July 2017, we completed the sale of our controlling ownership interest in CareerBuilder, completing our transformation into a pure-play media company. Our approximately 215.6 million outstanding shares of common stock are held by 6,189 shareholders of record as of January 31, 2018. Our headquarters is located at 7950 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA, 22107. Our telephone number is (703) 873-6600 and our website home page is www.tegna.com. We make our website content available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, nor is it incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K).

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements for our annual stockholders’ meetings and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our investor website, under “Investor Relations” at www.tegna.com as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file the material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, copies of our annual reports will be made available, free of charge, upon written request. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding SEC registrants, including TEGNA Inc. 
Employees
At the end of 2017, we employed 5,283 full-time and part-time people, all of whom were located in the U.S. The following table summarizes our employee headcount at the end of 2017 and 2016.

 | 2017 | 2016 
Media (1) | 5,108 | 4,908 
Corporate | 175 | 199 
Digital | — | 5,014 
Total | 5,283 | 10,121
(1) Our 2017 Media employee headcount includes approximately 200 DMS employees that were previously included in our Digital Segment in 2016.

Approximately 11% of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. They are represented by 24 local bargaining units, most of which are affiliated with one of four international unions under collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the broadcasting industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining. 
Environmental Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA and other federal agencies have the authority to write regulations that have an effect on our operations.
In addition to these federal regulations, various states have authority under the federal statutes mentioned above. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violating these laws and regulations. We believe that we have complied with such proceedings and orders at our stations without any materially adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statement of cash flows.
Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives
We are committed to managing our environmental impact responsibly and protecting the environment through our media programs and our charitable endeavors.  
Our television stations regularly cover environmental and sustainability issues that affect their communities. In 2017, WWL dedicated an investigative team of journalists to explore failures by the city of New Orleans to adequately maintain and invest in the infrastructure of the city’s drainage system following widespread failures. The “Down the Drain” project resulted in a series of reports that led to community outrage, changes in municipal leadership, and a spotlight on a lack of environmental and sustainability initiatives in New Orleans. WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan reported on possible links between groundwater contamination in Kent County and now defunct tannery operations. As a result, the state legislature is considering changes in safe drinking water standards to address concerns. KING in Seattle, Washington revealed civilian workers at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard were exposed to dangerous toxins for years, despite warnings from employees. WFAA in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, continued a series of investigative reports exposing links between groundwater contamination and fracking operations in the Barnett Shale. The ongoing investigative efforts raised questions from state lawmakers about the relationship between state regulators and the oil and gas industry. WFAA also continued its Project Green initiative, partnering with schools across North Texas to recognize educators who promote environmental and sustainability efforts.
We continue to focus on energy efficiency and reducing our carbon footprint. Efforts to digitize paper files has helped reduce paper storage and usage. Shredding of these paper files is part of a recycling program through a local business. Recycling copier waste toner cartridges, re-purposing office supplies, and the strategic placement of recycling waste containers throughout office space all contribute to a conscientious effort of responsibly managing our environmental impact. At our corporate offices in McLean, Virginia, we comply with the recycling guidelines set forth by Fairfax County and building management. This includes 
8

specialized recycling of electronics such as rechargeable batteries, computer peripherals and cell phones, as well as common everyday items such as cans, office paper and other paper products, glass and plastic bottles. 
At our stations, sustained power and energy efficiency projects were initiated or completed in 2017 to reduce electrical and heating costs. This includes a LED tower lighting replacement at WBIR in Knoxville, Tennessee; new studio LED lighting at WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky, KUSA/KTVD in Denver, Colorado, and KSDK in St. Louis, Missouri; energy-efficient HVAC replacement at KTVB in Boise, Idaho; as well as A/C unit replacements at WTSP in Tampa, Florida, a new hot water heater at WUSA in Washington, DC, and boiler replacement at WBIR in Knoxville.
TEGNA employees and their families took part in 51 Make A Difference Day projects in 2017. Make A Difference Day is one of the largest annual single-days of service nationwide. Since 1992, volunteers and communities have come together on Make A Difference Day with a single purpose: to improve the lives of others. Volunteer efforts often include environmentally beneficial projects such as planting trees, plants or keyhole gardens and cleaning up debris and repairing community spaces.
The TEGNA Foundation supports nonprofit activities in communities where we do business and contributes to a variety of charitable causes through its Community Grant Program. One of the TEGNA Foundation’s community action grant priorities is environmental conservation.
