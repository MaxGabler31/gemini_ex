Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Ebix, Inc. (“Ebix”, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1976 as Delphi Systems, Inc., a California corporation. In December 2003 the Company changed its name to Ebix, Inc. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
The Company has its worldwide headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia with its international operations being managed from its Dubai office; and also has domestic and international operations spread across 50+ offices. Amongst other offices, the Company also has operating facilities and offices in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Canada and India. In these operating offices, Ebix employs skilled technology and business professionals who provide products, services, support and consultancy services to more than 16,000 customers across six continents.
Ebix is a leading international supplier of on-demand infrastructure exchanges to the insurance, financial, and healthcare industries. In the Insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also, providing Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") enterprise solutions in the area of CRM, front-end & back-end systems, outsourced administrative and risk compliance.
With a "Phygital” strategy that combines 231,500 physical distribution outlets in many Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) countries to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in areas of domestic & international money remittance, travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments, etc., in an emerging country like India. EbixCash, through its travel portal Via.com, is also one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges with over 110,000 distribution outlets and 8,000 corporate clients processing over 24.5 million transactions every year.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 71% of Ebix revenues came from on-demand exchanges.
Ebix's goal is to be the leading powerhouse of insurance and financial transactions in the world. The Company’s technology vision is to focus on the convergence of all channels, processes and entities in a manner such that data seamlessly flows once a data entry has initially been made. Ebix strives to work collaboratively with clients to develop innovative technology strategies and solutions that address specific business challenges and requirements. Ebix combines the newest technologies with its capabilities in consulting, systems design and integration, IT and business process outsourcing, applications software, and web and application hosting to meet the individual needs of organizations.
Acquisition & Integration Strategy
The Company views business acquisitions as an integral part of the Company's growth strategy, an efficient way to further expand its reach, and an effective utilization of the operating cash generated from the Company's business. However, management does not believe that this acquisition strategy is entirely critical to the Company's future profitability or liquidity. We look at making complimentary accretive acquisitions as and when the Company has sufficient liquidity, stable cash flows, and access to financing at attractive interest rates to do so, if necessary. 
The Company seeks to acquire businesses that are synergistic to Ebix's existing products and services. In this regard the Company's goal is to provide comprehensive, on-demand based solutions that simplify transaction processing by carrying data from one end to another seamlessly. Any acquisition made by Ebix typically will fall into one of two different categories: one, wherein the acquired company has products and/or services that are competitive to our existing products and services; and two, wherein the acquired company's products and services are a complement to and an extension of our existing products and services. 

In cases where an acquired company's products and services are competitive to our existing products and services, the Company immediately strives towards the goal of providing a single product or service in the functional area, with a common code base around the world rather than having multiple products addressing the same need. In each case, the Company immediately works towards assimilating the best of breed functionality on a common architecture approach, to provide a single product or service to our end customers. The Company's goal remains to provide an easy to use solution for our customer base, while ensuring that any product or service integrates seamlessly with other existing or outside functionalities. Irrespective of whether the acquired company's product/service is retired or the existing product/service is retired, the Company is focused on maximizing operational 
2

efficiency for our business while creating new cutting-edge products and services that can replace both existing or acquired product or service offerings in order to make future product sales and maintenance more efficient. 
Once an acquisition is consummated, the infrastructure, personnel resources, sales, product management, development, and other common functions are integrated with our existing operations to ensure that efficiencies are maximized and redundancies eliminated. We generally do not maintain separate sales, development, product management, implementation or quality control functions following the closing of any acquisition, in order to ensure that the integration is efficient across all fronts. The Company integrates and, where appropriate, centralizes certain key functions such as product development, information technology, marketing, sales, finance, administration, and quality assurance immediately after an acquisition, to ensure that the Company can maximize on cost efficiencies. Simultaneously with the integration of any acquired company, the Company's resources and infrastructure are leveraged to work across multiple functions, products and services, making it neither practical nor feasible to precisely separately track and disclose the specific earnings impact from the business combinations we have executed after they have been acquired. Consequently, the concept of “acquisitive growth” versus “organic growth” becomes obscured given the dynamics and underlying operating principals of Ebix's acquisition, integration, and growth strategy. This tactic is a key part of our business strategy that facilitates high levels of efficiency, operating income margins and consistent end-to-end vision for our business, and differentiates the Company from our competitors. Our plan is to make niche acquisitions in the insurance, e-learning, healthcare and finance sector, integrate them seamlessly into the Company and make them efficient by implementing Ebix's standardized processes, with the goal of increasing operating profits and cash flows for the Company.
In many of the acquisitions made by the Company, there are contingent consideration terms associated with the achievement of certain designated revenue targets for the acquired Company. This structure allows us to still carry on with our integration strategy, while enabling the acquired company to be eligible for a revenue based contingent purchase consideration. Accordingly we are able to maximize operational productivity while allowing the principals of the acquired company access to a greater opportunity for a contingent reward.
The Company's integration strategies are targeted at improving the efficiency of our business, centralizing key functions, exercising better control over our operations, and providing consistent technology and product vision across all functions, entities and products. This is a key part of our business philosophy designed to enable Ebix to operate at a high level of efficiency and facilitate a consistent end-to-end vision for the industry.

Industry Overview
The insurance industry markets have initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate improvements in the efficiency both at the back-end side and also at the consumer-end side. Such consolidation has involved both insurance carriers and insurance brokers and is directly impacting the manner in which insurance products are distributed. Management believes the insurance industry will continue to experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly a norm across the world insurance markets.

Information on the geographic dispersion of the Company’s revenues and long-lived assets is furnished in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. See Item 1A (Risk Factors) for discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.
The Company’s product and service strategy focuses on: (a) expansion of connectivity between all entities through its Exchange family of products in the financial, travel, life, health, workers compensation, risk management, annuity and property and casualty ("P&C") sectors namely the EbixCash and EbixExchange family of products; (b) worldwide sales and support of P&C back-end insurance and broker management systems; (c) worldwide sale, customization, development, implementation and support of its P&C back-end insurance carrier system platforms; (d) risk compliance solution services, which include insurance certificate origination, certificate tracking, claims adjudication call center, consulting services and back office support; and (e) e-governance/e-learning solutions in emerging world markets.
Ebix also provides software development, customization, and consulting services to a variety of entities in the insurance industry, including carriers, brokers, exchanges and standard making bodies.
Ebix’s revenue, at present, is generated through four main channels in which the Company conducts its operations: Exchanges, Carrier Systems, Broker Systems, and Risk Compliance Solutions. The revenue streams for each of these channels are further described below in the following paragraphs.
Exchanges: This channel forms the primary focus of the Company across the world. Ebix operates data exchanges in the areas of finance, travel, life insurance, annuities, employee health benefits, risk management, workers compensation, insurance underwriting, and P&C insurance. Each of these exchanges connects multiple entities within the financial and insurance markets enabling the participant to seamlessly and efficiently carry and process data from one end to another. Ebix’s life, annuity, and employee health benefit exchanges currently operate primarily in the United States. The P&C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Ebix financial and travel exchanges currently operate primarily in India and certain ASEAN countries. Exchange revenue is derived from two main sources, namely subscription fees associated with accessing the exchange and transaction fees charged for each transaction processed on an Ebix Exchange. These exchanges have been designed to completely adhere to industry and regulatory data standards. 
Broker P&C Systems: The Company's main focus in this channel is on markets outside the United States. The Company does not believe that the United States broker systems market can provide the Company with the operating margin levels that the Company seeks. The number of independent brokers has been steadily decreasing in the United States and the space is fairly crowded in terms of the number of software players addressing the market. Consequently, Ebix’s primary focus in the area of broker systems is on designing and deploying back-end systems for international P&C insurance brokers who are seeking a worldwide system solution. Ebix has three back-end systems in this area: eGlobal, which targets multinational P&C insurance brokers; WinBeat, which targets P&C brokers in the Australian and New Zealand markets; and, EbixASP, which is a system for the P&C insurance brokers in the United States. Revenue from eGlobal is derived from two main sources, specifically subscription license-based revenues and time and material fees charged to customize the product to a broker’s specific functional requirements. Revenue from WinBeat is derived from monthly subscription fees charged to each P&C broker in Australia and New Zealand that has deployed the service. Revenue from EbixASP comes from monthly subscription fees charged to each P&C broker in the United States using the service. Each of these products is continually being redesigned, recoded and updated to adhere to the most current prevailing technologies.
5

RCS: Ebix’s focus in this channel pertains to business process outsourcing services that include providing domain intensive project management, time and material based consulting engagements to clients across the world, the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance issued in the United States and Australian markets, the provision of claims adjudication and settlement, call center, and back office support. Ebix focuses on helping its clients outsource any specific service or manpower to the Company on an onsite or offshore basis. With respect to our insurance certificate related business outsourcing service, Ebix provides a software-based service for the issuance of certificates of insurance that fully adhere to industry standards such as ACORD. Ebix derives transaction-based revenues for each certificate that is created. Ebix also provides a service to track certificates of insurance for corporate clients in the United States and Australia that generates transactional-based revenue for each certificate tracked.
Carrier P&C Systems: This channel is the smallest part of the Company's business, since the Company has continued to de-emphasize its attention to this sector, while focusing its efforts primarily on Exchanges, Healthcare, e-Governance, and e-Learning. Ebix’s work in the area of carrier systems pertains to the designing and deploying on-demand back-end systems for P&C insurance companies. Revenue from these services is derived from subscription revenues or license revenues from clients and time and material fees charged to customize these products to an insurance company’s specific functional requirements.
Product Development
The Company focuses on maintaining high quality product development standards. Product development activities include research and the development of platform and/or client specific software enhancements such as adding functionality, improving usefulness, increasing responsiveness, adapting to newer software and hardware technologies, or developing and maintaining the Company’s websites.
The Company has spent $33.9 million, $33.0 million, and $30.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on product development initiatives. The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement and redesign of the Exchange, broker systems, carrier systems, and RCS product and service lines to keep our technology at the cutting edge in the markets we compete. Development efforts also provide new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the redesign, coding and development of new services for international and domestic markets.
Competition
We believe Ebix is in a unique position of being the only company worldwide in insurance software markets that provides services in all four of our above listed revenue channels. Conversely, though, this also means that in each of these areas Ebix has different competitors. In fact, in most of these areas Ebix has a different competitor in each country in which we operate. In our Exchange operations Ebix often has a different competitor on each line of exchange in each country.
 The Company has centralized worldwide product management, intellectual property rights development and software and system development operations in Dubai, Singapore, and India, which provides it a competitive edge. With its strong focus on quality, our Indian operations deliver cutting edge solutions for our customers across the world. India is rich in technical skills and the cost structure is significantly lower as compared to the United States. Ebix continues to expand its India operations as a learning center of excellence with a strong focus on hiring skilled professionals with expertise in insurance systems and software applications. This focus on building this knowledge base combined with the ability to hire more professional resources at India's lower cost structure has enabled Ebix to consistently protect its knowledge base and to deliver projects in a cost-effective fashion. The following is a closer and more detailed discussion of our competition in each of these four main channels.
Exchanges: Ebix operates a number of exchanges and the competition for each of those exchanges varies within each of the regions in which Ebix operates.
Life Insurance Exchange — Ebix operates a straight through processing end-to-end Life Exchange service that has three life insurance exchanges in the United States — namely Winflex, TPP, and LifeSpeed. Winflex is an exchange for pre-sale life insurance illustrations between brokers and carriers, TPP is an underwriting and highly customized electronic application platform for Life insurance, while LifeSpeed is an order entry platform for life insurance. Each of these exchanges is presently deployed in the United States and the Company is also continuing to deploy them in other parts of the world. Ebix has one main competitor in the life exchange area: iPipeline. Ebix differentiates itself from this competitor by virtue of having an end-to-end solution in the market as with all of its exchanges being interfaced with other broker systems and customer relationship management ("CRM") services such as EbixCRM. We believe Ebix’s exchanges also have the largest aggregation of life insurance brokers and carriers transacting business in the United States.
Annuity Exchange — Ebix operates a straight through processing end-to-end Annuity Exchange service that has three life insurance exchanges in the United States - namely AnnuityNet, AMP and AN4. These exchanges are platforms for annuity transactions between brokers, carriers, broker general agents (“BGAs”), and other entities involved in annuity transactions. These 
6

exchanges are mainly deployed in the United States, while the Company endeavors to make efforts to deploy it in other parts of the world, such as Latin America and Australia. Ebix deployed its AN4 service that was fully developed internally by Ebix, and is highly scalable, customizable and can be delivered over the cloud. Ebix has one main competitor in the annuity exchange area, iPipeline. Again, Ebix differentiates itself from this competitor by virtue of having an end-to-end solution offering in the market with its exchanges being interfaced with broker systems and customer relationship management (CRM) services such as EbixCRM. Ebix exchanges also benefit from transacting the largest amounts of premiums in annuity business on any single exchange in the United States.
Ebix CRM — Ebix’s customer relationship management exchange, SmartOffice is designed to address the specific needs of insurance companies, general agents, banks, financial advisors and investment dealers. Smart Office is tightly integrated into EbixExchange Life, Health, P&C and Annuity exchanges as a means to make end-to-end enterprise-wide information exchange seamless for our clients. This insurance industry specific domain expertise gives Ebix a competitive advantage over our competitors in the CRM area such as Salesforce.com, iPipeline and Redtail. 
Employee Benefits — Ebix currently provides employee benefit and health insurance exchange services using four platforms namely Facts, LuminX, HealthConnect and EbixEnterprise. EbixEnterprise, which we built from the ground up, is the most recent Enterprise Health Exchange being deployed by Ebix across all 50 states. Collectively, these platforms service approximately nine million lives and produce hundreds of thousands of health insurance quotes annually. These platforms are sold to health carriers and third party administrators. These platforms provide the full range of services such as employee enrollment, claims adjudication, accounting, employee benefits administration accounting and compliance. The HealthConnect insurance quoting portals service the individual and small group marketplace. Ebix has a number of competitors of varying sizes in this area. Trizetto is currently the largest employee benefits software player in the market in the US while there are other smaller size competitors, such as BenefitFocus and Ultimate Software. 
A.D.A.M. Health Solutions — Ebix provides multimedia health content, training, patient education, and continuing education that targets large diversified websites, doctors, consumer health portals, country governments, hospitals, healthcare, biomedical, medical device, pharmaceutical, and education organizations. A.D.A.M.’s competitors are a variety of health content companies such as Krames Staywell, Red Nucleus and Anatomy One, who are primarily focused on the US markets. A.D.A.M content is available in Spanish, Portuguese, German and other languages in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.
P&C Exchanges — Ebix operates P&C exchanges in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. All of these exchanges are targeted to the areas of personal and commercial lines, and facilitate the exchange of insurance data between brokers and insurance carriers. Ebix continues to deploy these exchanges in the United States, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. There is presently little competition in the P&C exchange area in Australia and New Zealand. Our PPL insurance underwriting exchange platform is deployed in London. Our competitive differentiation exists by virtue of having an end-to-end solution offering in the market allowing our exchanges to be interfaced with multiple broker systems.

EbixCash Financial Exchanges - With a "Phygital” strategy that combines 231,500 physical distribution outlets in many ASEAN countries to a Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in areas of domestic & international money remittance, travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments etc. in an emerging country like India. EbixCash through its travel portal Via.com is also one of South East Asia’s leading travel exchanges with over 110,000 distribution outlets and 8,000 corporate clients, processing over 24.5 million transactions every year. Our competitive differentiation exists by virtue of having a wide variety of converged end-to-end solution offerings in the market.
Broker P&C Systems: Ebix has three broker system offerings for P&C brokers worldwide: eGlobal, WinBeat and EbixASP. The competition for these broker systems varies within each of the regions in which Ebix provides such products and services.
eGlobal is sold throughout the world. The product is multilingual and multicurrency and is available in a number of languages such as English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. eGlobal is targeted to the medium and large P&C brokers around the world. eGlobal competition tends to be different in each country with no single competitor having a global offering. eGlobal competes with home grown systems and regional players in each country. Its uniqueness comes from the fact that the product is both multilingual and multicurrency yet still has a common code base around the world with features that are easily activated and deactivated.
WinBeat is a back-end broker system that is currently sold in Australia and New Zealand. It is targeted at small P&C brokers in these countries. The product at present is available only in English and can be deployed in a few hours with minimal training. WinBeat’s competition in Australia and New Zealand comes mainly from local vendors such as Lumley and SSP. Ebix intends to deploy WinBeat in a number of emerging insurance markets such as India and China.
7

Between eGlobal and WinBeat, Ebix's broker systems customer base in Australia spans 632 of the 790 P&C brokers in Australia giving it 80% of the broker systems customer base in this country.
EbixASP is Ebix’s P&C broker systems offering for the United States markets. The service is designed around the ACORD insurance standards used in the United States. EbixASP has two main competitors in the United States, specifically Vertafore and Applied Systems.
RCS Services: Ebix’s focus in this channel pertains to business process outsourcing services that include providing domain intensive project management, time and material based system consulting services to clients across the world, and claims adjudication/settlement services, in addition to the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance issued in the United States and Australian markets. Ebix's RCS channel focuses on helping its clients outsource any specific service or manpower to the Company on an onsite or offshore basis. Ebix's RCS certificate outsourcing business services are enabled by the Company’s SaaS-based proprietary software. Ebix’s RCS service offerings currently cater to a large number of Fortune 500 companies in the United States. 
Ebix’s RCS service offering in the insurance certificate issuance area has one main competitor in the United States, namely Applied Systems. Due to the highly fragmented market, the Ebix RCS service offering in the insurance certificate tracking area also has a number of smaller competitors such as Datamonitor, CMS, and Exigis.
Carrier P&C Systems: Ebix has two carrier system offerings for P&C carriers, Ebix-Advantage and Ebix Advantage Web. Ebix-Advantage is targeted at small, medium and large P&C carriers in the United States that operate in the personal, commercial and specialty line areas of insurance. Ebix AdvantageWeb is designed for the international markets and is targeted at the small, medium and large P&C carriers in the international markets that operate in the personal, commercial and specialty line areas of insurance. Ebix-AdvantageWeb is designed to be multicurrency and multilingual and is deployed in Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States. Competition to both these products comes from large companies, such as CSC, Guidewire, Xchanging, Accenture and specialty medical malpractice players like Delphi.
Intellectual Property

We regard our software as proprietary while adhering to open architecture industry standards and attempt to protect it with copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on the disclosure and transferring of title.

None of the Company’s employees are presently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the Company's relations with its employees to generally be good.
