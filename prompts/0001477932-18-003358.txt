Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of our management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Based on the discontinuation of our former business plan, our current business model is to identify a viable business operation that can merge with our operation. Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding this should be read with a view that such transaction may not occur in the near term or at all.
 
These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time except as required by law. We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions.
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Intellisense,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to Intellisense Solutions Inc. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars.
