ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 Astra’s mission is to launch a new generation of launch services and space services and products to improve life on Earth. These services and products are enabled by new constellations of small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”), which have rapidly become smaller, cheaper, and many times more numerous than legacy satellites. Launch vehicles, however, have not evolved in the same way — most rockets remain focused on serving legacy satellites and human spaceflight missions. As a result, we believe existing launch vehicles are too large, expensive, infrequently launched, and insufficiently responsive to meet the needs of the evolving space market.
 We aim to solve this problem with the world’s first mass-produced dedicated orbital launch system. Our system consists of a small launch vehicle and mobile ground infrastructure that can fit inside standard shipping containers for rapid deployment anywhere in the world that our spaceports are located. Our rocket requires a launch site with little more than a concrete pad and only six Astra employees on-site, leveraging our highly automated launch operations. Our production system is designed to scale efficiently, which we expect to allow us to perform to hundreds of launches per year in the future. Our rocket’s payload capacity is tailored for the needs of modern LEO satellite constellations, allowing precise and rapid placement of individual satellites in their required orbits. We believe this makes Astra’s system more responsive and affordable than other launch alternatives for the thousands of LEO satellites planned in the coming decade.
 We have made significant progress in the development of the system to date. On November 20, 2021, we launched launch vehicle LV0007 into orbit at an inclination of 86.0 degrees, an altitude of 500 km and velocity of 7.61 km/s, making Astra one of the fastest U.S. companies to have successfully demonstrated the orbital placement of a test payload. We commenced paid commercial launch services in 2022 and on February 10, 2022, we launched launch vehicle LV0008. After a nominal first stage flight, the payload fairing did not fully deploy prior to the upper stage ignition due to an electrical issue, which, together with a software issue, resulted in the upper stage not reaching orbit and the end of the mission. Through our investigation process, we identified and have since corrected the issues that caused the error in the payload fairing’s deployment and addressed the software issue. On March 15, 2022, we conducted an orbital launch with launch vehicle LV0009, our second paid commercial launch, which successfully reached an Earth orbit and successfully deployed its payload. We apply an iterative approach to product development, emphasizing testing and learning as fast as possible through rapid iteration, co-located design, build, and test facilities, and frequent launches, which we believe is unique and the reason for our success to date. We have signed customer contracts for contracted revenue for our launch services, representing approximately 50 launches (as of December 31, 2021), which are expected to occur through 2025.
 We view launch services as the first phase of our product and service offerings, with the ultimate single goal of building the leading space platform under a one operating segment model and one reportable segment. We intend to expand our product and service offerings to LEO operators to include launch services, space products and space services to achieve our space services platform model. Our integrated space services platform will allow our customers to focus on innovative applications rather than investing in bespoke satellite development and separately contracting launch services. Further details of our current and expected future service offerings are provided below.
•Launch Services — To provide rapid, global, and affordable launch services to satellite operators and governments in partnership with third-party spaceport providers globally. Our launch services includes services tied directly to our launch along with complementary services that are not part of our fixed pricing for which we charge a separate fee. We currently operate our launches from Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida. We plan to add additional launch sites in diverse locations based on our customers' inclination requirements and as we increase the frequency of launches.
 •Space Products— To design and provide the space products based on the customers' needs for a successful satellite launch and other products that we may sell in the future. Currently we offer two in space electric propulsion systems.
 •Space Services — To invest in building our portfolio of space services which includes communication service and constellation services which will be based on a network of spacecraft that we intend to build and allow customers to access for use in their business. Specifically, our space services encompass all aspects of hosted satellite and constellation services, including hosting customer payloads onto our spacecraft, and delivering services, such as communication services.
 2021 Highlights and Recent Developments
 On June 30, 2021, Holicity consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated as of February 2, 2021 (the “BCA”), by and among Holicity, Holicity Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Holicity (“Merger Sub”), and Astra Space Operations (“pre-combination Astra”). Immediately upon the consummation of the Business Combination, Merger Sub merged with and into Astra Space Operations with Astra Space Operations surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holicity. Holicity changed its name to “Astra Space, Inc.”, and pre-combination Astra changed its name to “Astra Space Operations, Inc.”
 

On July 1, 2021, we, through our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, merged with Apollo Fusion, Inc. ("Apollo"). The fair value of the consideration paid as of July 1, 2021, was $70.8 million, net of cash acquired (the "Apollo Merger"). Apollo designs, tests, manufactures and operates propulsion modules to enable satellites to orbit in space.
 On August 20, 2021, this propulsion module (known as the ACE thruster) achieved successful orbital ignition on board the Spaceflight Sherpa-LTE1 orbital transfer vehicle (OTV). The Sherpa OTV launched June 30, 2021 from SpaceX’s Transporter-2 mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida. After successfully deploying all rideshare payloads, Spaceflight commissioned our thruster. This was our first attempt at firing the thruster in orbit and this thruster continues to fire in orbit.
 On August 28, 2021, we conducted a test launch for the United States Space Force on our launch vehicle LV0006. The launch vehicle achieved an altitude of approximately 50 km before the range issued an all engine-shutdown command. The launch vehicle was not able to reach orbit.
 On November 4, 2021, we filed an application with the Federal Communication Commission, under which we requested authority to launch and operate a non-geostationary orbit satellite system using V-band frequencies (the "Constellation") as we work to build out our space services offering.
 On November 20, 2021, we conducted our first commercial orbital launch for United States Space Force on our launch vehicle LV0007. The launch system successfully demonstrated the orbital placement of a test payload to an inclination of 86.0 degrees at an altitude of 500 km. The payload achieved an orbital velocity of 7.61 km/s. When we use the term “commercial orbital launch,” we mean a launch conducted pursuant to a license from the Federal Aviation Administration and we do not receive payment for some of our commercial orbital launches. Launch vehicle LV0007 took flight from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska.
 On November 26, 2021, the Company issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants ("Redeemable Warrants") outstanding as of December 27, 2021. In connection with the redemption, the holders of 9,413,895 Public Warrants and 5,333,333 Private Placement Warrants elected to receive 3,775,709 shares of Class A common stock in lieu of the redemption price of 0.2560374 shares of Class A Common Stock per Warrant. A total of 586,075 Public Warrants remained unexercised as of December 27, 2021 and the Company redeemed the Public Warrants for a redemption price of $0.10 per Redeemable Warrant, and aggregate of $0.1 million. The Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were remeasured to fair value as of the exercise or redemption date, resulting in a gain of $25.7 million for year ended December 31, 2021, and classified within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On February 10, 2022, we conducted a commercial orbital launch for National Aeronautics and Space Administration pursuant to which we were to deliver four CubeSats to low-earth orbit on our launch vehicle LV0008. After a nominal first stage flight, the payload fairing did not fully deploy prior to the upper stage ignition due to an electrical issue which, together with a software issue, resulted in the upper stage not reaching orbit and the end of the mission. Through our investigation process, we identified and have since corrected the issues that caused the error in the payload fairing’s deployment, and addressed the software issue. This was our first launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and also the first launch under the Federal Aviation Administration new Part 450 launch license. Part 450 consolidates Parts 415, 417, 431 and 435 under a single licensing regime and is expected to make it easier for to obtain regulatory approval from the FAA for future launches.
 On March 15, 2022, we conducted an orbital launch for three customers of Spaceflight, Inc. and confirmed our first delivery of customer payloads into Earth orbit. Launch vehicle LV0009 took flight from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska.
 Strategy Overview
 Using our expertise in the mass production of small launch vehicles or rockets, we seek to provide customers with reliable, daily space delivery as well as turn-key space services. To accomplish this, we intend to:
 •Increase launch capability. We plan to demonstrate a monthly launch capability by the end of 2022 and approach a more frequent launch capability by the end of 2025. In order to achieve these milestones, we are accelerating our development and production efforts and exploring locations for additional launch sites based on our customers’ inclination needs.
 •Increase the payload of our rockets. We plan to increase the maximum payload capacity of our launch vehicle to meet the customer needs and demands through a process of iterative development and improvement.
 •Commence commercial launch operations. In November 2021, we successfully launched launch vehicle LV0007 to an altitude of 500 km successfully demonstrating the orbital placement of a test payload. We commenced paid commercial launch in 2022.
 •Space Services offering. By 2023, we plan to commence offering an integrated spacecraft platform optimized for Astra’s launch vehicle and spacecraft. The goal is to allow our customers to focus on developing innovative payloads rather than designing or developing satellite buses or flying satellites.
 

Our ability to achieve these goals and objectives by our planned timelines are conditional upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully and timely develop our launch vehicles and our ability to effectively market and sell our services and products. Please see Item 1A: Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could affect our ability to achieve these goals.
 Customer Overview
 As of December 31, 2021, we have signed contracts for launch services. Our customers primarily include satellite operators, satellite manufacturers, government agencies and defense prime contractors. These signed contracts span over multiple customers and represents approximately 50 launches to be conducted beginning from year 2022 through year 2025. We have also entered into sales contracts with satellite operators and manufacturers for our space electric propulsion systems, which we expect to begin fulfilling in late 2022.
 We expect a portion of our pipeline to continue to convert into new contacts for launch services and space products over the coming months. We believe that our traction to date is driven by our value proposition and direct marketing to potential customers. We note that a portion of this pipeline may not convert if we do not achieve certain milestones or if we are unable to keep up with the demand for our launch services from a production and delivery perspective.
 Sales and Marketing
 We plan to scale and accelerate our sales and marketing efforts and leverage industry partnerships to grow our customer base. Additionally, as we execute on our upcoming launches, we expect existing customers to expand their contracts with us for the deployment of their future satellites. New service offerings and sales models will be introduced over time to increase market share.
 While we are currently focused on market for small-satellite launch services and our space products, we are in the early stages of developing our space services offerings. Our potential customer base for this service has significant overlap with launch services.
 Unit Economics of Our Business Models
 •Launch Services. Launch services are typically priced inclusive of the launch cost of the rocket and are offered as a price per rocket. The end price to the customer is fixed and depends on whether the launch is on a dedicated or ride share basis. In addition, we may offer certain customers bulk discounts, and other customers may elect to purchase add-on services which are priced separately. Costs for launch services are largely fixed in nature and include the operation of our factory and test facility. We embed the variable costs of manufacturing of the launch vehicle and labor into the price as well. The difference represents our unit margins.
 •Space Products. Space products include design and delivery of a propulsion module which consists of a thruster, a power processing unit, tank and a feed system. Space products are priced considering the design and engineering requirements of the propulsion module. The contract price is fixed for the propulsion module and typically includes additional pricing for engineering services related to customizing the propulsion module. Costs for space products are largely variable in nature and include the time spent on design and engineering requirements and costs of manufacturing of the propulsion module which is embedded into the price. The difference represents our unit margins.
 •Space Services. We are still in the early stages of developing our space services offerings and have not yet determined how this will be priced. This service is expected to generate revenue in two ways. The first is with the launch and initial delivery of customers payload to their desired orbits, which represent the same unit economics as described in above in launch services. The second is the communication services and constellation services provided through our spacecraft.
Human Capital
 Our employees are the cornerstone to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had 324 employees, all of whom were full-time. Our workforce is primarily based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Prior to joining our company, many of our employees had prior experience working for a wide variety of reputed commercial aviation, aerospace, high-technology and world-recognized organizations.
 Our human capital management strategy includes identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our cash and equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of cash-based and stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Our management team is comprised of our chief executive officer and his six direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, particularly our diversity, capability development and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development and succession plans for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent. Across our broader population,


approximately 20.7% of full-time employees are women and 39.4% belong to historically underrepresented groups. As we build out the team, we are also investing in the infrastructure needed for continuous professional development, feedback, performance management, and other aspects of a healthy, growth-oriented and high-performing work culture.
 Regulatory
 Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA")
 In order to conduct a launch, we must obtain a commercial space transportation license from the FAA. On August 18, 2021, the FAA granted a commercial space transportation license to us, allowing us to conduct flights of our launch vehicle (Rocket v3.0) from Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska to deliver customer payloads to LEO. This license is effective for launches on Rocket v3.0 through March 9, 2026. In addition, on February 4, 2022, the FAA granted us the first commercial space transportation license under Part 450, allowing for flights of our launch vehicle (Rocket v3.3) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to deliver customer payloads into LEO. This license is effective through January 4, 2027, for launches on Rocket v3.3. Unlike other commercial space transportation licenses, Astra can request a modification of the Part 450 license to add additional launch sites for Rocket v3.3, which is expected to save us the time and expense of applying for a new license for launches using Rocket v3.3.
 If there is a mishap during a launch, the FAA will require us to open an investigation into the mishap and we will not be able to launch until the investigation is closed, or the FAA has made a favorable public safety determination.
 Federal Communications Commission ("FCC")
 The regulations, policies, and guidance issued by the FCC apply to the radio frequencies utilized during operation of our launch vehicles. When we communicate with our launch vehicles using any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we are operating a space station to which FCC regulations apply. Operators of regulated space stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses throughout the duration of any given mission.
 The FCC recently enacted a new set of licensing guidelines for small satellites and related systems that may apply to future Astra launch vehicles or satellites manufactured by Astra. As a result, we may face a transition in license types from Special Temporary Authorization ("STA") to the small satellite licensing guidelines. Additionally, the FCC is currently considering additional rules which could change the operational, technical and financial requirements for commercial space operators subject to U.S. jurisdiction. If these, proposed rules become final, they could change system design and financial costs in order to comply with or secure new Astra spectrum licensure.
 As a U.S. licensee, the regulations, policies, and guidance issued by the FCC apply to the operation of Astra’s future satellite constellation and satellite services. Radio frequency communications between Astra satellites, gateways and user terminals for operations within the U.S. market are regulated by the FCC, including both space stations (satellites) and earth stations (gateways and user terminals). Operators of regulated space stations and earth stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses throughout the duration of operations. Additionally, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) defines international radio regulations, recommendations, and technical standards which all apply to Astra’s constellation and satellite services globally.
 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Controls
 Our business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the ITAR and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business.
 Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under the ITAR, we must receive permission from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons.
 

See “Item 1A: Risk Factors — We are subject to stringent U.S. export and import control laws and regulations" for more information about the risks associated with the requirements of ITAR and EAR.
 Environmental Law Compliance
 We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, greenhouse gases and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at or from the property which could result in operational disruptions. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions.
