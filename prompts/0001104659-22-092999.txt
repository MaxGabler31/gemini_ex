social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our business operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the duration and degree of COVID-19’s continued effects over time. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic or recurrence thereof, deployment and administration of vaccines, governmental, business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic and impact on economic activity, including possible recession or financial market instability. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding potential risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Industry Overview
We sell our security and inspection systems and healthcare products primarily to end-users, while we design and manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems and provide electronics manufacturing services primarily for OEM customers.
Security. A variety of technologies are currently used globally in security and inspection applications, including transmission and backscatter X-ray, 3-D and computed tomography, radiation detection, metal detection, radar, millimeter wave imaging, chemical explosive trace detection, and optical inspection. We believe that the market for security and inspection products will continue to be affected by the threat of terrorist incidents, drug trafficking, gun violence, and by new government mandates and appropriations for security and inspection products in the United States and internationally.
As a result of terrorist attacks worldwide, security and inspection products are used at a wide range of facilities other than airports, such as border crossings, railways, seaports, cruise line terminals, freight forwarding operations, sporting venues, government and military installations, and nuclear facilities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has undertaken numerous initiatives to prevent terrorists from entering the country, hijacking airliners, and obtaining and trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and their components, to secure sensitive U.S. technologies and to identify and screen high-risk cargo before it is loaded onto airlines and ships. These initiatives, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s Air Cargo Screening Mandate and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Container Security Initiative, have resulted in increased demand for security and inspection products.
Certain of these government sponsored initiatives in the United States have also stimulated security programs in other areas of the world in part because the U.S. initiatives call on other nations to bolster their port security strategies, including acquiring or improving their security and inspection equipment and screening operations. The international market for non-intrusive inspection equipment and related services, therefore, continues to expand as countries that ship goods directly to the United States participate in such programs and as they choose to procure and operate equipment in order to secure their own borders, transportation networks, facilities and other venues.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and international air transportation security regulators around the world require the screening of air cargo. Several of our screening systems have been approved by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration, as well as by various international regulatory bodies, for this purpose and are being procured and used by freight forwarders, airlines, airports, transportation companies and other businesses to fulfill their compliance requirements. These and other regulations promulgated by international organizations have resulted in an ongoing global demand for airline, cargo, port and border security and inspection technologies. 
Healthcare. Healthcare has been, and we believe will continue to be, a growing economic sector throughout much of the world. Developing countries in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region are expected to continue to build healthcare infrastructure to serve expanding middle class populations. In developed areas, especially the United States, Europe, and mature Asian countries, aging populations and extended life expectancy are projected to fuel growth in healthcare for the foreseeable future.
While we believe that the healthcare industry will continue to grow throughout much of the world, many factors are forcing healthcare providers to do more with less. These factors include stricter government requirements affecting staffing and accountability and uncertainty around potential U.S. healthcare legislation. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare provider resources, placing increased focus on the advantages of remote monitoring and products which can be deployed flexibly, enabling hospitals to quickly reconfigure and adapt to unexpected change. Our customers expect clinical value, economic value, and clinical decision support. Positioning our current healthcare products to demonstrate the competitive value in total cost of ownership is increasingly important in this environment. At the same time, the widespread introduction of mobile devices into the healthcare environment is creating an

emerging demand for patient data acquisition and distribution. Our Healthcare division designs, manufactures and markets devices and software that respond to these factors, helping hospitals reduce costs, make better-informed clinical decisions, and more fully utilize resources.
We are a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care solutions for use in hospitals, medical clinics and physician offices. We design, manufacture and market patient monitoring solutions for critical, sub-acute and perioperative care areas of the hospital, wired and wireless networks and ambulatory blood pressure monitors, all aimed at providing caregivers with timely patient information. Our cardiology and remote monitoring systems include Holter recorders and analyzers, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, resting and stress electrocardiography (ECG) devices, and ECG management software systems and related software and services.
Optoelectronics and Manufacturing. We believe that continued advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems, including computer processing power and memory, have broadened the optoelectronics market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications. In addition, we see a trend among OEMs to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic devices as well as value-added subsystems to fully-integrated, independent manufacturers, like us, that may have greater specialization, broader expertise and more flexibility to respond to short cycle times and quicker market expectations.
Our optoelectronic devices are used in a wide variety of applications for diversified markets including aerospace and defense, avionics, medical imaging and diagnostics, biochemistry analysis, pharmaceutical, nanotechnology, telecommunications, construction and homeland security. Medical applications for our devices include diagnostic and imaging products, patient monitoring equipment, and glucose monitors. Aerospace and defense applications for our devices include satellite navigation sensors, laser guided munitions systems, range finders, weapons simulation systems, and other applications that require the conversion of optical signals into electrical signals. Homeland security applications for our devices include X-ray based and other detection systems. Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are also used in a wide variety of measurement control, monitoring and industrial applications and are key components in telecommunications technologies. We also offer electronics manufacturing services to broader markets, as well as to our optoelectronics customers and to our Security and Healthcare divisions. We offer full turnkey solutions as well as printed circuit board assembly, cable and harness assembly, liquid crystal displays and box-build manufacturing services, in which we provide product design and development, supply chain management, and production manufacturing services.

Capitalizing on the Market for Security and Inspection Systems. The trend toward increased screening of goods entering and departing from ports and borders has resulted, and may continue to result in, the growth in the market for cargo inspection systems and turnkey security screening services that are capable of inspecting shipping containers for contraband and assisting customs officials in the verification of shipping manifests. Package and cargo screening by freight forwarders, airlines and air cargo companies represents a growing sector, as regulations in the United States and Europe have continued to require screening of air cargo shipments. We plan to capitalize on opportunities to replace, service and upgrade existing security installations, and to offer turnkey security screening solutions in which we may construct, staff and/or operate on a long-term basis security screening checkpoints for our customers. 
We expect that a market for software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms that are capable of integrating the data that our security inspection systems produce with related information derived from vehicle plates, cargo container numbers, drivers’ licenses, government databases, and other sources will also continue to develop, mature and grow, particularly as customers shift their operating procedures to take advantage of secure, cloud-based, networking technologies. We are a leader in the development of integrating non-intrusive inspection with such sources and to transmit such data to operators working within secure, remote screening facilities. Since 2011, our software has been used by customs and tax authorities in the United States, Europe and Latin America to screen over one million containers and vehicles. In the future, we believe that government agencies and commercial customers may increasingly rely on such SaaS offerings to remotely review and adjudicate screening decisions over secure networks as well as to communicate with and monitor the performance of inspectors working on the ground at distant ports, border crossings and other checkpoints.
Finally, we also intend to continue to develop new security and inspection products and technologies, including software, and to enhance our current product and service offerings through internal research and development and selective acquisitions.
Improving and Complementing Existing Medical Technologies. We develop and market patient monitoring systems, cardiology and remote monitoring products, and connected care systems and associated supplies and accessories. Our efforts to develop new products and improve our existing medical technologies are focused on the needs of healthcare organizations, caregivers, and their patients. Our efforts to improve existing medical technologies concentrate on providing products that are flexible and intuitive to use so that clinicians can deliver accurate, precise, reliable and cost-effective care.

As a result of terrorist attacks worldwide, security and inspection products have increasingly been used at a wide range of facilities other than airports, such as border crossings, railways, seaports, cruise line terminals, sporting venues, freight forwarding operations, government and military installations and nuclear facilities. As a result of the use of security and inspection products at additional facilities, we have diversified our sales channels for security and inspection products.
Many of our security and inspection systems utilize dual-energy X-ray imaging technology with computer software enhanced imaging methods to facilitate the detection of materials and items such as explosives, weapons, narcotics, bulk currency or other contraband. In addition, many of our systems use dual-view X-ray imaging, which allows operators to examine objects from two directions simultaneously, thereby reducing the need for re-scanning of objects and improving the operator’s ability to detect threats quickly and effectively. Our baggage and parcel inspection, cargo and vehicle inspection and hold (checked) baggage screening inspection systems range in size from compact mobile systems to large systems comprising entire buildings in which trucks, shipping containers or pallets are inspected. Many of our inspection systems are also designed to be upgradeable to respond to new customer requirements as they emerge or change.
Our cargo and vehicle inspection applications, in which vehicles, cars, trucks, shipping containers, pallets and other large objects can be inspected, are designed in various configurations, including gantry, portal and mobile systems. These products are primarily used to verify the contents of cars, trucks or cargo containers and to detect the presence of contraband, including narcotics, weapons, explosives, radioactive and nuclear materials and other smuggled items. Most of our cargo and vehicle inspection systems employ X-ray imaging to non-intrusively inspect objects and present images to an inspector, showing shapes, sizes, locations and relative densities of the contents. These systems utilize transmission imaging technology, backscatter imaging technology, or both technologies. We also manufacture passive radiation detection devices for detecting nuclear threat material utilizing their gamma and neutron signatures. Additionally, we have developed isotope-specific identification algorithms. Many of these systems have been built to meet specific customer inspection requirements.
We believe that we offer one of the broadest technology platforms in the baggage and parcel and cargo and vehicle inspection systems industry. Our broad platform permits us to offer customers solutions, which optimize flexibility, performance and cost to meet the customers’ unique application requirements.
Our Security division offers a range of systems that use different types of x-ray imaging, for example dual-view, multi-view or computed tomography, to provide image data to detection algorithms that allow the automated detection of a range of threat items and materials. Typical threat items include explosives, narcotics and weapons. In many cases these systems are designed to meet the regulated detection requirements of relevant bodies such as the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and the European Union. Such automated detection systems are targeted towards applications such as hold baggage screening, cabin baggage screening and air cargo screening, and approvals from those bodies are recognized and used as de facto standards globally with few exceptions.
Our Security division also offers trace detection systems that are designed to detect trace amounts of explosives as well as narcotics. We also offer people screening products, such as walk-through metal detector (WTMD) products for use at security checkpoints at airports, government buildings, sports arenas and other venues. These systems are designed to be used in screening people, baggage and other items for illicit materials and weapons. 
Patient Monitoring and Cardiology and Remote Monitoring. Our Healthcare division designs, manufactures and markets products globally to end users primarily under the “Spacelabs” trade name.
Spacelabs products include patient monitors for use in perioperative, critical care and emergency care environments with neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our patient monitoring systems such as Xprezzon® and Qube® are supported by surveillance systems connected by wireless or hardwired networks, as well as standalone monitors that enable patient data to be transported physically from one monitor to another as the patient is moved. These systems enable hospital staff to access patient data where and when it is required. In addition, these products are designed to interact with hospital information systems.
Spacelabs SafeNSound™ assists hospitals in providing value-based care by streamlining workflows and improving communications. Features include comprehensive reporting tools, a communications dashboard for monitor technicians, and a device management system to admit patients to monitors/telemetry at the bedside.

Spacelabs Intesys® Clinical Suite (ICS) provides a software suite allowing hospitals to leverage their infrastructure to capture data from the bedside, compact and telemetry monitors. 
Our PathfinderSL® and Lifescreen™ Pro analysis tools provides clinicians the ability to save Holter analysis time and to do detailed analysis when needed inside or outside the hospital. Our Eclipse Pro Holter recorders provide up to 14 days of 3-channel recording or up to 72 hours of 12 lead with pacing. Our Eclipse Mini Ambulatory ECG Recorder provides up to 30 days of 3-channel ECG and when paired with Lifescreen™ Pro clinicians can analyze millions of heart beats within minutes.We are also a supplier of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitors which are routinely used by physicians around the world and by contract research organizations. Many physicians are using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to detect “white coat” hypertension, a condition in which people experience elevated blood pressure in the doctor’s office but not in their daily lives. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring helps improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize the associated costs of treatment. Spacelabs OnTrak™ ambulatory blood pressure system has been validated for both pediatric and adult patient types and includes the capability to measure activity correlation with non-invasive blood pressure readings.
Our Sentinel® 11 Cardiology Information Management System is designed to provide an electronic, enterprise-wide scalable system for cardiology and remote monitoring. Sentinel integrates data from Spacelabs-branded products and third-party devices into a central enterprise-wide database system that can be accessed by care providers and medical facility administrators, thereby providing enhanced workflow and efficiencies. The system’s web-based solution enables the secure transfer of data from multiple remote sites. Sentinel supports mobile and remote working, taking ECG management to the point of care for flexible use of devices and capture of data.
In addition, the capital-intensive products that our Healthcare division sells have supplies and accessories associated with them that can represent annuity revenue opportunities. Additionally, our Healthcare division manufactures multivendor-compatible accessories for use with third-party devices.
Optoelectronic Devices and Manufacturing Services. Optoelectronic devices designed, manufactured and sold through our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division generally consist of both active and passive components.

In the United States, the FDA has broad regulatory powers with respect to pre-clinical and clinical testing of new medical devices and the designing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, federal law and FDA regulations require that all new or significantly modified medical devices introduced into the market be preceded either by a pre-market notification clearance order under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), or an approved pre-market approval (PMA) application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls as deemed necessary by the FDA, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the product for which clearance has been sought is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA had not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications. After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. In that case, the applicant must correct the submission errors before resubmitting. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of, and clear or deny, a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. The FDA may formally request additional information, which may toll or restart the 90 day deadline. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer than 90 days and sometimes is not granted at all. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have a substantially equivalent intended use and indications for use as the predicate device, and either have substantially equivalent technological characteristics to the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support the demonstration of substantial equivalence. Multiple interactions and/or the submission of additional information or documentation may be required to secure regulatory clearance.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new submission is not required, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite premarket notification or PMA submissions.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are typically subject to the PMA application process, which is more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires substantial clinical data. To date, all of the patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems we manufacture and sell in the United States have required only 510(k) pre-market notification clearance.

FDA clearance or approval, when granted, may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed, and such product approvals, once granted, may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing. Manufacturers of FDA-regulated products are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval governmental regulation, including, but not limited to, the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution; Quality System (also known as Good Manufacturing Practices) Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, risk management, validation, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; product and promotional labeling regulations; advertising and promotion requirements; restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; PMA annual reporting requirements; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur; medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; an order of repair, replacement or refund; device tracking requirements; and post-approval study and post-market surveillance requirements. The FDA has also established a Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) system that requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices distributed in the United States with unique device identifiers. Also, we must comply with cybersecurity requirements to assess cybersecurity and safety risks and design and develop our devices to ensure safe and effective performance in the face of cyber threats. It is also incumbent on us to monitor third party software for new vulnerabilities and verify and validate any software updates or patches meant to address vulnerabilities.
Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and Reimbursement. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe and Asia. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. In addition, because there is generally no separate reimbursement from third-party payers to our customers for many of our products, the additional costs associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of our customers. Accordingly, these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over healthcare products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
Healthcare cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical devices to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
Significant healthcare reforms have had an impact on medical device manufacturer and hospital revenues. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. Many states have also adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies, in part due to state budgetary pressures. Ongoing uncertainty regarding implementation of certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act makes it difficult to predict the impact the Affordable Care Act or state law proposals may have on our business. This has created uncertainty in the market, which could result in reduced demand for our products, additional pricing pressure, and increased demand for new and more flexible payment structures.

Other Healthcare Laws. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, data privacy and security laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws, and transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are subject to extensive regulations protecting the privacy and security of patient health information that we receive, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPAA”). Among other things, these regulations impose extensive requirements for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information.” The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt state laws and regulations relating to personal information that may also apply to us. Our failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.
The HIPAA provisions also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. Government. Medical device manufacturers have been held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing customers with inaccurate billing or coding information.
These laws impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other service arrangements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to material penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Additionally, there has been a trend towards increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires that certain device manufacturers track and report to the government information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other clinical staff, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties for “knowing failures.” Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.

We are subject to similar laws in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, within the EU, the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law in each of the member states. The member states of the EU closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies. We could face civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions if any member state determines that we have breached our obligations under its national laws. Industry associations also closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or authorities name us as having breached our obligations under their regulations, rules or standards, our reputation would suffer, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Other Foreign Healthcare Regulations
We are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture, market, and/or import our products. For example, the commercialization of certain products, including medical devices, in the EU is regulated under a system that presently requires all such products sold in the EU to bear the CE marking—an international symbol of adherence to the medical device regulations and standards of the EU. Our manufacturing facilities in Hawthorne, California; Snoqualmie, Washington; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; Batam, Indonesia; and Hyderabad, India are all certified to the International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 13485 standard for quality management. Our Hawthorne, California and Snoqualmie, Washington facilities are also certified to the requirements of Annex II, section 3 of the Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices, which allows them to self-certify that manufactured products can bear the CE marking. Further, the implementation of the Restriction of Hazardous Substance Directive (“ROHS”) requires that certain products, including medical devices, shipped into the EU eliminate targeted ROHS substances.
The International Medical Device Regulators Forum has implemented a global approach to auditing manufacturers of medical devices. This audit system, called the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”), provides for an annual audit of a medical device manufacturer by a certified body on behalf of various regulatory authorities. Current authorities participating in MDSAP include the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, Brazil’s Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria, Health Canada, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and the FDA. It is expected that more regulatory authorities will participate in MDSAP in the future.
We and other medical device manufacturers will soon be confronted with major changes in the EU’s decades-old regulatory framework which governs market access to the EU. The Medical Devices Regulation (“MDR”) will replace the EU’s current Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and the EU’s Directive on active implantable medical devices (90/385/EEC).
Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have a transition time to meet the requirements of the MDR. The MDR differs in several important ways from the EU’s current directives for medical devices and active implantable medical devices. The most significant changes in the regulation include:

● | The definition of medical devices covered under the MDR will be significantly expanded to include devices that may not have a medical intended purpose, such as colored contact lenses. Also included in the scope of the regulation are devices designed for the purpose of “prediction and prognosis” of a disease or other health condition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Device manufacturers will be required to identify at least one person within their organization who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new MDR. The organization must document the specific qualifications of this individual relative to the required tasks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The MDR requires rigorous post-market oversight of medical devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The MDR will allow the EU Commission or expert panels to publish “Common Specifications,” such as requirements for technical documentation, risk management, or clinical evaluation, which devices shall be required to meet.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Devices will be reclassified according to risk, contact, duration, and invasiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Systematic clinical evaluation will be required for Class IIa and Class IIb medical devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All currently approved devices must be recertified in accordance with the new MDR requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have a dedicated team updating and revising key systems, processes, and product technical documentation to meet the new MDR requirements and transition timeline.

Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various environmental laws, directives, and regulations pertaining to the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances used, and hazardous wastes generated, in the manufacture of our products. Such laws mandate the use of controls and practices designed to mitigate the impact of our operations on the environment, and under such laws we may be held liable for the costs associated with the remediation and removal of any unintended or previously unknown releases of hazardous substances on, beneath or from our property and associated operations, including the remediation of hazardous waste disposed off-site. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe that, except to an extent that would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we are currently in compliance with all environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations, and that we have obtained all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. The amount of hazardous substances used, and hazardous wastes generated, by us may increase in the future depending on changes in our operations. To ensure compliance and practice proper due diligence, we conduct appropriate environmental audits and investigations at our manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, and, to the extent practicable, on all new properties. Our manufacturing facilities conduct regular internal audits to ensure proper environmental permits and controls are in place to meet changes in operations. Third-party investigations address matters related to current and former occupants and operations, historical land use, and regulatory oversight and status of associated properties and/or operations (including surrounding properties). The purpose of these studies is to identify, as of the date of such report, potential areas of environmental concern related to past and present activities or from nearby operations. The scope and extent of each investigation is dependent upon the size and complexity of the property and/or operation and on recommendations by independent environmental consultants.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change. We compete with a number of other manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. In addition, these competitors may have the ability to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies, adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, have stronger customer relationships, have greater name recognition and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against designers and manufacturers of specialized electronic systems and components or within the markets for security and inspection systems, patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, or optoelectronic devices. Future competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the security and inspection market, competition is based primarily on factors such as product performance, functionality and quality, government regulatory approvals and qualifications, the overall cost effectiveness of the system, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the products, price, local market presence, program execution capability, and breadth of sales and service organization. Competition results in price reductions and reduced margins and could result in loss of market share. Although our competitors offer products in competition with one or more of our products, we can supply a variety of system types and offer among the widest array of solutions available from a single supplier. This variety of technologies also permits us to offer unique hybrid systems to our customers that utilize two or more of these technologies, thereby optimizing flexibility, performance and cost to meet the customer’s unique application requirements.
In the patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care markets, competition is also based on a variety of factors including product performance, functionality, value and breadth of sales and service organization. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of our market share. We believe that our patient monitoring products are easier to use than the products of many of our competitors because we offer a consistent user interface throughout many of our product lines. We also believe that the capability of our monitoring systems to connect together, and to the hospital IT infrastructure, is a key competitive advantage. Further, while some of our competitors are also beginning to introduce portal technology, which allows remote access to data from the bedside monitor, central station or other point of care, we believe that our competing technologies bring valuable, instant access to labs, radiology and charting at the point of care.

14



In the markets in which we compete to provide optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing services, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, technical support and the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through production. Because we specialize in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise, we believe that we generally do not compete to any significant degree with any other large United States, European or Asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components. Competition in the extensive electronic manufacturing services market ranges from multinational corporations with sales in excess of several billion dollars, to large regional competitors and to small local assembly companies. In our experience, the OEM customers to whom we provide such services prefer to engage companies that offer both local and lower-cost off-shore facilities. Along with a number of domestic competitors for these services, our high-volume, low-cost contract manufacturing locations in Southeast Asia compete with other manufacturers in the same region.
Backlog
We currently measure our backlog as quantifiable purchase orders or contracts that have been signed, for which revenues are expected to be recognized within the next five years. In instances where we are not able to estimate the value of a purchase order or contract, they are not included in backlog.
We ship most of our baggage and parcel inspection, people screening, patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems and optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems within one to several months after receiving an order. However, such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including supply chain disruptions and any special design or requirements of the customer. In addition, large orders of security and inspection products typically require greater lead-times. Fulfillment of orders of our Rapiscan RTT hold (checked) baggage screening equipment generally requires longer lead times. Further, we provide turnkey screening services to certain customers for which we may recognize revenue over multi-year periods.
Certain of our cargo and vehicle inspection systems may require more than a year of lead-time. We have experienced some significant shipping delays associated with our cargo and vehicle inspection systems. Such delays can occur for many reasons, including: (i) additional time necessary to coordinate and conduct factory inspections with the customer before shipment; (ii) a customer’s need to engage in time-consuming site construction to accommodate the system, over which we have no control or responsibility; (iii) additional fine tuning of such systems once they are installed; (iv) design or specification changes by the customer; (v) time needed to obtain export licenses and/or letters of credit; and (vi) delays originating from other contractors on the project. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges and may continue to do so until supply chain delays and international travel restrictions and other protective measures subside.
As of June 30, 2022, our consolidated backlog totaled $1,232 million, compared to $1,076 million as of June 30, 2021. Approximately $514 million of our backlog as of June 30, 2022 is not reasonably expected to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2023. Sales orders underlying our backlog are firm orders; although, from time to time we may agree to permit a customer to cancel an order, or an order may be cancelled for other reasons. Variations in the size of orders, product mix, or delivery requirements, among other factors, may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period and should not be considered a meaningful indicator of our performance on an annual or quarterly basis.
Human Capital
The strength and talent of our workforce are critical to the success of our businesses, and we continually strive to attract, develop and retain personnel commensurate with the needs of our businesses. Our human capital management priorities are designed to support the execution of our business strategy and improve organizational effectiveness. We support our employees’ financial, health, and social well-being through competitive compensation structures, including a robust employee stock purchase program and retirement benefits, as well as innovative health and well-being programs focused on promoting the physical and mental health of our workforce. In addition, in response to COVID-19, we implemented changes to protect our employees and to support health and safety protocols. We also strive to create opportunities for career development and growth. We provide training and development programs to foster connections, leadership competency, and team and individual development, and we have a tuition reimbursement program to encourage ongoing education.
We understand the importance of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to upholding a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We value the unique contributions of every person, and we hold firm to the ideals of fairness, equal opportunity and mutual respect for all forms of diversity and differing abilities. We are committed to pay equity and protecting the rights of underrepresented 

15



groups within our organization, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Our broader diversity strategies include focus at all levels of our organization, including with senior management and our Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2022, 45% of our global workforce was female and 52% of our U.S. workforce was ethnically diverse.
As of June 30, 2022, we employed 6,298 people, of whom 3,900 were employed in manufacturing, 539 were employed in engineering or research and development, 627 were employed in administration, 370 were employed in sales and marketing and 862 were employed in service capacities. Of the total employees, 1,984 were employed in the Americas, 3,443 were employed in Asia and 871 were employed in Europe.
