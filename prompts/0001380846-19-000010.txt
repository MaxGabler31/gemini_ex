ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “holding company,” the “parent company,” or the “Company”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: TriState Capital Bank (the “Bank”), a Pennsylvania chartered bank; Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC (“Chartwell”), a registered investment advisor; and Chartwell TSC Securities Corp. (“CTSC Securities”), a registered broker/dealer. Through our bank subsidiary we serve middle-market businesses in our primary markets throughout the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and New York and we also serve high-net-worth individuals on a national basis through our private banking channel. We market and distribute our banking products and services through a scalable branchless banking model, which creates significant operating leverage throughout our business as we continue to grow. Through our investment management subsidiary, we provide investment management services primarily to institutional investors, mutual funds and individual investors on a national basis. Our broker/dealer subsidiary, CTSC Securities, supports the marketing efforts for Chartwell’s proprietary investment products.
We operate two reportable segments: Bank and Investment Management.

• | The Bank segment provides commercial banking products and services to middle-market businesses and private banking products and services to high-net-worth individuals through the Bank. Total assets of the Bank were $5.95 billion as of December 31, 2018. 


• | The Investment Management segment provides investment management services primarily to institutional investors, mutual funds and individual investors through Chartwell and also supports marketing efforts for Chartwell’s proprietary investment products through CTSC Securities. Assets under management of Chartwell were $9.19 billion as of December 31, 2018. 

On April 6, 2018, Chartwell completed the acquisition of investment management contracts, select personnel and related assets from Columbia Partners, L.L.C. Investment Management (“Columbia”), totaling approximately $1.07 billion in assets under management (the “Columbia acquisition”).
For additional financial information by segment, refer to Note 23, Segments, to our consolidated financial statements.
Our Business Strategy
Our success has been built upon the vision and focus of our executive management team to combine the sophisticated products, services and risk management efforts of a large financial institution with the personalized service of a community bank. We believe that a results-based culture, combined with a well-managed middle-market and private banking business, and our targeted investment management business, will continue to grow and generate attractive returns for shareholders. The following are the key components of our business strategies:
Our Sales and Distribution Culture. We focus on efficient and profitable sales and distribution of investment management services and banking products and services to middle-market businesses and private banking clients. Our relationship managers and distribution professionals have significant experience in the banking and financial services industries and are focused on client service. In our banking business, we monitor net interest income contribution, loan and deposit growth, and asset quality by market and by relationship manager. Our compensation program is designed within our banking business to incentivize our regional presidents and relationship managers to prudently grow their loans, deposits and profitability, while maintaining strong asset quality. In our investment management business, our compensation program is designed to incentivize new assets under management while maximizing the retention of existing clients and exceeding benchmark investment performance.
Disciplined Risk Management. We place a strong emphasis on effective risk management as an integral component of our organizational culture. We use our risk management infrastructure to monitor existing operations, support decision-making and improve the success rate of existing products and services as well as new initiatives. A major part of our risk management effort has been our focus on increasing non-interest income, including the expansion of our investment management business through our recent acquisition. In our banking business, this has also included our focus on growing loans originated through our private banking channel. We believe these loans have lower credit risk because they are typically secured by readily liquid collateral, such as marketable securities, and/or are personally guaranteed by high-net-worth borrowers. In addition, we mitigate risk associated with these loans through active daily monitoring of the collateral, utilizing our proprietary technology.
5

Experienced Professionals. Having successful and high quality professionals is critical to continuing to drive prudent growth in our business. In addition to our experienced executive management team and board of directors, we employ highly experienced personnel across our entire organization. Our commercial and private banking presidents as well as our regional banking presidents have an average of more than 30 years of banking experience and our middle-market and private banking relationship managers have an average of nearly 25 years of banking experience. Chartwell’s mission is successfully executed through the dedication of investment professionals who average over 20 years of industry experience. We believe that our distinct business model, culture, and scalable platform enable us to attract and retain high quality professionals. Additionally, our low overhead costs give us the financial capability to attract and incentivize qualified professionals who desire to work in an entrepreneurial and results-oriented organization.
Efficient and Scalable Operating Model. With respect to our banking business, we believe our branchless banking model gives us a competitive advantage by eliminating the overhead and intense management requirements of a traditional branch network. Moreover, we believe that we have a scalable platform and organizational infrastructure that positions us to grow our revenue more rapidly than our operating expenses. We also believe that our investment management business has an efficient and scalable business model that focuses on institutional direct clients and wholesale distribution channels to reach retail investors.
Lending Strategy. We generate loans through our middle-market banking and private banking channels. These channels provide risk diversification and offer significant growth opportunities.

• | Middle-Market Banking Channel. Our middle-market banking channel primarily targets businesses with revenues between $5.0 million and $300.0 million located within our primary markets. To capitalize on this opportunity, each of our representative offices is led by an experienced regional president so we can understand the unique borrowing needs of the middle-market businesses in their area. They are supported by highly experienced relationship managers with reputations for success in targeting middle-market business customers and maintaining strong credit quality within their loan portfolios. 


• | Private Banking Channel. We provide loan products and services nationally to executives and high-net-worth individuals most of whom we source through referral relationships with independent broker/dealers, wealth managers, family offices, trust companies and other financial intermediaries. Our private banking products primarily include loans secured by cash, marketable securities, cash value life insurance and other asset-based loans. Our relationship managers have cultivated referral arrangements with 189 financial intermediaries. Under these arrangements, the financial intermediaries are able to refer their clients to us for responsive and sophisticated banking services. We believe many of our referral relationships also create cross-selling opportunities with respect to our deposit products and our investment management business. Since inception, we have had no charge-offs related to our loans secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance. 

As shown in the following table, we have continued to achieve loan growth through both of our banking channels. As of December 31, 2018, loans sourced through our middle-market banking channel were $2.26 billion, or 44.1% of our loans held-for-investment.
As of December 31, 2018, loans sourced through our private banking channel were $2.87 billion, or 55.9% of our loans held-for-investment, of which $2.77 billion, or 96.7%, were secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance. We expect continued strong loan and deposit growth in this channel, in part, because we added 24 new loan referral relationships during the year ended December 31, 2018, for a total of 189 referral relationships at the end of 2018. We have also experienced continued growth in the number of customers resulting from our existing referral relationships.

Loans held-for-investment | $ | 5,132,873 | | $ | 4,184,244 | | | $ | 948,629 | 22.7 | %

Deposit Funding Strategy. Since inception, we have focused on creating and growing a branchless, diversified, stable, and low all-in cost deposit channels, both in our primary markets and across the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we consider approximately 
6

87% of our total deposits to be sourced from direct customer relationships. We believe our sources of deposits continue to provide excellent opportunities for growth both within our primary markets and nationally.
We take a multilayered approach to our deposit growth strategy. We believe our relationship managers are an integral part of this approach and, accordingly, we measure and incentivize them to increase the deposits associated with their relationships. We have relationship managers who are specifically dedicated to deposit generation and treasury management, and we plan to continue adding such professionals as appropriate to support our growth. Additionally, we believe that our financial performance and our products and services, which are targeted to our markets, enhance our growth of cost-effective deposits.
Investment Management Strategy. We will continue to execute on our investment management strategy of selectively acquiring other investment management assets that complement Chartwell’s business, as evidenced by the Columbia acquisition in 2018. We believe that this segment has and will continue to enhance our recurring fee revenue, provide new product offerings for our national network of financial intermediaries, and leverage our financial services distribution capabilities through the financial intermediaries with which our banking business has worked and developed.
Our Markets
For our middle-market banking business, our primary markets of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and New York include the four major metropolitan statistical areas (“MSA”) of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio and New York (which includes northern New Jersey). We believe that our primary markets including these MSAs are long-term, attractive markets for the types of products and services that we offer, and we anticipate that these markets will continue to support our projected growth. With respect to our loans and other financial services and products, we selected the locations for our representative offices partially based upon the number of middle-market businesses located in these MSAs and their respective states. As of December 31, 2018, there were nearly 77,000 middle-market businesses in our primary markets with annual sales between $5.0 million and $300.0 million, which represented approximately 17% of the national total as of that date, according to Dun and Bradstreet. According to SNL Financial, the 2018 aggregate population of the four MSAs in which our headquarters and four representative offices are located was approximately 30 million, which represented approximately 10% of the national population. We believe that the population and business concentrations within our primary markets provide attractive opportunities to grow our business.
In addition to middle-market businesses in our primary markets, our private banking business also serves high-net-worth individuals on a national basis. We primarily source this business through referral relationships with independent broker/dealers, wealth managers, family offices, trust companies and other financial intermediaries. We view our product offerings as being most appealing to those households with $500,000 or more in net worth (not including their primary residence).
Through our distribution channels, we pursue and create deposit relationships, including treasury management relationships, with customers in our primary markets and throughout the United States. Because our deposit operations are centralized in our Pittsburgh headquarters all of our deposits are aggregated and accounted for in that MSA. For these distribution and reporting reasons, we do not consider deposit market share in any MSA or any of our primary markets to be relevant data. However, for perspective on the size of the deposit markets in which we have offices, the total aggregate domestic deposits of banks headquartered within the four MSAs were approximately $1.6 trillion as of December 31, 2018, according to SNL Financial.
Our investment management products are primarily distributed in two markets. These markets and their relative percentage of our assets under management as of December 31, 2018, were as follows: institutional and sub-advisory (70%) and broker/dealers and registered investment advisors (30%).
Institutional and Sub-Advisory. Chartwell maintains a dedicated sales and client service staff to focus on the distribution of its products to a wide variety of institutional and sub-advisory clients, including corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, public pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, foundations, endowments and registered investment companies. As of December 31, 2018, assets under management in the institutional and sub-advisory market included $2.21 billion in equity products and $4.22 billion in fixed-income products.
Broker/Dealer and Independent Registered Investment Advisors. Chartwell maintains sales staff dedicated to calling on national, regional and independent broker/dealers and registered investment advisors. Broker/dealers and registered investment advisors use Chartwell’s products to meet the needs of their customers, who are typically retail and/or high-net-worth investors. As of December 31, 2018, assets under management in the broker/dealer and independent registered investment advisor market included $1.67 billion in equity products and $1.09 billion in fixed-income products.

Loans
Our primary source of income in our Bank segment is interest on loans. Our loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to our private banking clients, commercial and industrial loans, and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties. Our loan portfolio represents the largest component of our earning assets.
The following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018.

(Dollars in thousands) | December 31, 2018 | Percent of Loans
Private banking loans | $ | 2,869,543 | | 55.9 | %
Middle-market banking loans: | | 
Commercial and industrial | 785,320 | | 15.3 | % 
Commercial real estate | 1,478,010 | | 28.8 | % 
Total middle-market banking loans | 2,263,330 | | 44.1 | % 
Loans held-for-investment | $ | 5,132,873 | | 100.0 | %

Private Banking Loans. Our private banking loans include both personal and commercial loans sourced through our private banking channel, which operates on a national basis. These loans primarily consist of loans made to high-net-worth individuals, trusts and businesses that may be secured by cash, marketable securities, cash value life insurance or other financial assets and to a smaller degree, residential property. We also have a small number of unsecured loans and lines of credit in our private banking loan portfolio that have been made to creditworthy borrowers. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income and assets of the borrowers. Since a majority of our private banking loans are secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance, we believe the credit risk inherent in this portfolio is lower than the risk associated with other types of loans. We mitigate such risks through active daily monitoring of the collateral, utilizing our proprietary technology.
Our private banking lines of credit predominantly are due on demand or have terms of 365 days or less. Our term loans (other than mortgage loans) in this category generally have maturities of three to five years. On an accommodative basis, we have made personal residential real estate loans consisting primarily of first and second mortgage loans for residential properties, including jumbo mortgages. Our residential mortgage loans typically have maturities of seven years or less. On a limited basis we originated mortgage loans with maturities of up to ten years and acquired other residential mortgages that had original maturities of up to 30 years. Our personal lines of credit typically have floating interest rates. We examine the personal cash flow and liquidity of our individual borrowers when underwriting our private banking loans not secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance. In some cases we require our borrowers to agree to maintain a minimum level of liquidity that will be sufficient to repay the loan.

The table below includes all loans made through our private banking channel by collateral type as of the date indicated.

(Dollars in thousands) | December 31, 2018 | Percent of Private Banking Loans | Percent of Loans
Private banking loans: | | | 
Secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance | $ | 2,774,800 | | 96.7 | % | 54.0 | %

Other | 24,977 | | 0.9 | % | 0.5 | % 
Total private banking loans | $ | 2,869,543 | | 100.0 | % | 55.9 | %

Commercial and Industrial Loans. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily includes loans made to service companies or manufacturers generally for the purposes of financing production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, acquisitions and recapitalizations. Cash flow from the borrower’s operations is the primary source of repayment for these loans. The primary risks associated with commercial and industrial loans include potential declines in the value of collateral securing these loans, the highly-leveraged nature and inconsistent earnings of some commercial borrowers, and the larger average balances of commercial and industrial loans made to individual borrowers. We work throughout the lending process to manage and mitigate such risks within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio.
Our commercial and industrial loans include both working capital lines of credit and term loans. Working capital lines of credit generally have maturities ranging from one to five years. Availability under our commercial lines of credit is typically limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line. Those assets typically include accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the risk profile of the borrower, we may require periodic accounts receivable and payable agings, as well as borrowing base certificates representing borrowing availability after applying appropriate advance percentage rates to the collateral. Our commercial and industrial term loans generally have maturities between three to five years, and typically do not extend beyond seven years. Our commercial and industrial lines of credit and term loans typically have floating interest rates.
The table below shows the composition of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio by borrower industry as of December 31, 2018.

All others | 88,938 | | 11.3 | % | 1.8 | % 
Total commercial and industrial loans | $ | 785,320 | | 100.0 | % | 15.3 | %

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We concentrate on making commercial real estate loans to experienced borrowers that have an established history of successful projects. The cash flow from income-producing properties or the sale of property from for-sale construction and development loans are generally the primary sources of repayment for these loans. The equity sponsors of our borrowers generally provide a secondary source of repayment from their excess global cash flows and liquidity. The primary risks associated with commercial real estate loans include credit risk arising from the dependency of repayment upon income generated from the property securing the loan, the vulnerability of such income to changes in market conditions, and difficulty in liquidating collateral securing the loans. We work throughout the lending process to manage and mitigate such risks within our commercial real estate loan portfolio. The commercial real estate portfolio also includes loans secured by owner-occupied real estate and the primary source of repayment for these loans is cash flow from the borrower’s operations. 
Our commercial real estate loans are primarily made to borrowers with projects or properties located within our primary markets. Our relationship managers are experienced lenders who are familiar with the trends within their local real estate markets.

Loan Underwriting
Our focus on maintaining strong asset quality is pervasive through all aspects of our lending activities, and it is apparent in our loan underwriting function. We are selective in targeting our lending to middle-market businesses, commercial real estate investors and developers, and high-net-worth individuals that we believe will meet our credit standards. Our credit standards are determined by our Credit Risk Policy Committee that is made up of senior bank officers, including our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Bank President and Chief Executive Officer, President of Commercial Banking and President of Private Banking.
Our underwriting process is multilayered. Prospective loans are first reviewed by our relationship managers and regional presidents. The prospective commercial and certain private banking loans are then discussed in a pre-screen group composed of the Chief Credit Officer, Senior Credit Officer, President of Commercial Banking, President of Private Banking and all of our regional presidents. Applications for prospective loans that are accepted are fully underwritten by our credit administration group in combination with the relationship manager. Finally, the prospective loans are submitted to our Senior Loan Committee for approval, with the exception of certain loans that are fully secured by cash, marketable securities or cash value life insurance. Members of the Senior Loan Committee include our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice Chairman, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Credit Officer, Bank President and Chief Executive Officer, President of Commercial Banking, President of Private Banking and our regional presidents. All of our lending personnel, from our relationship managers to the members of our Senior Loan Committee, have significant experience that benefits our underwriting process.
We maintain high credit quality standards. Each credit approval, renewal, extension, modification or waiver is documented in written form to reflect all pertinent aspects of the transaction. Our underwriting analysis generally includes an evaluation of the borrower’s business, industry, operating performance, financial condition and typically includes a sensitivity analysis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.
Our lending activities are subject to internal exposure limits that restrict concentrations of loans within our portfolio to certain targets and maximums based on a percentage of total loan commitments and as a multiple of total risk-based capital. These exposure limits are approved by our Senior Loan Committee and our board of directors based upon recommendations made by the Credit Risk Policy Committee. Our internal exposure limits are established to avoid unacceptable concentrations in a number of areas, including in our different loan categories and in specific industries. In addition, we have established a preferred lending limit that is significantly lower than our legal lending limit.
Our loan portfolio includes Shared National Credits (“SNC”). Effective January 1, 2018, the bank regulatory agencies revised the SNC definition to increase the loan size from $20 million or more to $100 million or more and that are still shared by three or more financial institutions. We are typically part of the originating bank group in connection with these loan participations. We utilize the same underwriting criteria for these loans that we use for loans that we originate directly. These loans are to borrowers typically located within our primary markets and are generally made to companies that are known to us and with whom we have direct contact. They offer advantages in a diversified loan portfolio. These loans have helped us to diversify the risk inherent in our loan portfolio by allowing us to access a broader array of corporations with different credit profiles, repayment sources, geographic footprints and with larger revenue bases than those businesses associated with our direct loans. Still, we are focused more on growing our direct loans than SNC loans. As of December 31, 2018, we had $236.1 million of SNC loans compared to $314.4 million as of December 31, 2017.
Loan Portfolio Concentrations
Geographic criteria. We focus on developing client relationships with companies that have headquarters and/or significant operations within our primary markets.

The table below shows the composition of our commercial loan portfolios based upon the states where our borrowers are located. Loans to borrowers located in our four primary market states made up 84.0% of our total commercial loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018. When those loans are aggregated with our loans to borrowers located in states that are contiguous to our primary market states, the percentage increases to approximately 90.1% of our commercial loan portfolio.

Other states | 223,914 | | 9.9 | % 
Total commercial loans | $ | 2,263,330 | | 100.0 | %

Diversified lending approach. We are committed to maintaining a diversified loan portfolio. We also concentrate on making loans to businesses where we have or can obtain the necessary expertise to understand the credit risks commonly associated with the borrower’s industry. We generally avoid lending to businesses that would require a high level of specialized industry knowledge that we do not have. 
Deposits
An important aspect of our business franchise is the ability to gather deposits and establish and grow meaningful relationships related to liquidity and treasury management customers. Deposits provide the primary source of funding for our lending activities. We offer traditional depository products including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit in addition to CDARS® and ICS® reciprocal products. We also offer cash management and treasury management services, including online balance reporting, online bill payment, remote deposit, liquidity services, wire and ACH services and collateral disbursement. Our deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to statutory limits.
As of December 31, 2018, non-brokered deposits represented approximately 87.3% of our total deposits. Our non-brokered deposit sources primarily include deposits from financial institutions, high-net-worth individuals, family offices, trust companies, wealth management firms, corporations and their executives. We compete for deposits by offering a range of deposit products at competitive rates. We also attract deposits by offering customers a variety of cash management services. We maintain direct customer relationships with many of our depositors that participate in CDARS® and ICS® reciprocal deposits.

Investment Management Products
Chartwell Investment Partners manages $9.19 billion in a variety of equity and fixed income investment styles, for over 250 institutional investors, mutual funds and individual investors as of December 31, 2018. A description of each investment style is provided below.
Equity Investment Strategies:

• | Small Cap Value: Chartwell’s Small Cap Value portfolio employs a traditional value style supplemented with both deep and relative value stocks. Our opportunity set is selected using multiple valuation yardsticks and focuses heavily on company valuation relative to history. Portfolio decisions result from business reviews assessing the prospects of erasing these valuation discounts with a focus on fundamental and event-driven catalysts which we believe the market should recognize. The portfolio aims to be well diversified across all economic sectors and exhibit better growth, profitability and financial strength characteristics than the small cap value benchmark. Our objective is to outperform small cap value benchmarks over the long term while producing lower risk scores versus peers. 


• | Mid Cap Value: Chartwell’s Mid Cap Value portfolio employs a traditional value style supplemented with both deep and relative value stocks, similar to Chartwell’s Small Cap Value strategy. Our objective is to outperform mid cap value benchmarks over the long term while producing lower risk scores versus peers. 


• | Small Cap Growth: Our Small Cap Growth portfolio invests in a select set of small growth oriented companies that have demonstrated strong increases in earnings per share. More significantly, we look to invest in companies that have historically continued to broaden, deepen and enhance their fundamental capabilities, competitive positions, product and service offerings and customer bases. Our plan is to invest in these companies for an intermediate time horizon. Our portfolios focus on a narrow set of such investments. 


• | Mid Cap Growth: Our Mid Cap Growth portfolio invests in a select set of mid-cap growth oriented companies, similar to Chartwell’s Small Cap Growth strategy. 


• | SMID Cap Growth: For clients in our SMID Cap Growth portfolio we invest in a select set of growth oriented companies with small to mid-market caps focused on securities held in Chartwell’s Small Cap Growth and Mid Cap Growth portfolios. 


• | U.S. Small Cap: The U.S. Small Cap portfolio integrates the efforts of our Small Cap Value and Small Cap Growth investment teams. The final portfolio is constructed as a bottom up residual of stock selection from the “best ideas” of both value and growth. 


• | Dividend Value: Our objective in managing the Dividend Value portfolio is to deliver investment returns that exceed that of the Russell 1000 Value by focusing on what we believe are undervalued stocks with above-average dividend yields. We seek long-term inflation protection by investing in stocks in the top 40% of the market ranked by dividend yield; companies that we believe are capable of consistent dividend growth; and stocks that we believe are undervalued with significant potential for capital appreciation during a full market cycle. 


• | Covered Call: Our objective in managing Chartwell’s Covered Call strategy is to provide market-like returns in rising equity markets while earning superior returns in flat or down equity markets. We seek to attain this objective by combining a portfolio of higher dividend paying stocks which have valuations that do not properly reflect our view of their fundamentals and a disciplined call overwriting strategy. We join these two investment disciplines in an effort to create a lower volatility total return solution for clients. 


• | Micro Cap Value: Chartwell’s Micro Cap Value strategy offers investors a diversified portfolio of small-cap stocks selected in accordance with the Chartwell’s value style. 

Fixed Income Investment Strategies:

• | Intermediate/Core/Short Duration Fixed Income: Chartwell's philosophy of investment grade fixed income management stresses security selection, preservation of principal, and compounding of the income stream as keys to consistently add value in the bond market. We focus our research efforts in the corporate sector of the market. Because the return potential of any bond tends to be asymmetric - with limited capital appreciation potential, but considerably greater capital loss potential - Chartwell targets high quality credits with stable-to improving profiles. 

Chartwell utilizes a disciplined value, bottom-up approach to the fixed income market, with emphasis on building the portfolio through individual security selection. Our goal is to reduce risk and volatility exposures through credit research; therefore, 
12

duration shifts, sector swapping, interest rate bets and macroeconomic forecasting are not a central focus in our bottom-up process. Futures, options and other leveraged derivatives are not utilized in our credit central process.

• | Core Plus Fixed Income: With flexibility to adjust to each client’s specific guidelines, Chartwell’s Core Plus product invests across both the U.S. Investment Grade and High Yield markets. By strategically expanding our credit-driven, valued-based opportunity set, the portfolio is able to take advantage of Chartwell’s broad ranging corporate bond expertise and to benefit from the potential for increased income, total return and diversification. 


• | High Yield Fixed Income: Chartwell's philosophy of high yield bond management stresses preservation of principal and compounding of the income stream as keys to adding value in the high yield bond market. In evaluating investment candidates our perspective is that of a lender. We focus on the higher quality tiers of the market, which offer an attractive yield premium but a lower incidence of credit erosion relative to the market as a whole. Chartwell believes that the consistent application of high credit standards and strict trading disciplines is the most predictable route to outperformance in the high yield bond market. 


• | Short Duration BB-Rated High Yield Fixed Income: Chartwell's philosophy of high yield bond management stresses preservation of principal and compounding of the income stream as keys to adding value in the high yield bond market. Again, our focus is on the higher quality tiers of the market, which offer an attractive yield premium but a lower incidence of credit erosion relative to the market as a whole. We focus on duration of less than three years with maximum maturities of five years. 

Balanced Investment Strategies:

• | Conservative Allocation: The Conservative Allocation strategy is managed utilizing Chartwell’s value-oriented security selection process and includes the Berwyn Income Fund as one of its main products. While the majority of funds managed under this strategy are invested in bonds, it may invest up to 30% of its assets in dividend-paying common stocks. We believe the fund’s balanced, income-oriented approach may afford a greater level of price stability than an all equity portfolio. 

Our total assets under management of $9.19 billion increased $880.0 million, or 10.6%, as of December 31, 2018, from $8.31 billion as of December 31, 2017. We reported new business and new flows from existing accounts and acquired assets of $2.74 billion, partially offset by outflows of $1.50 billion and market depreciation of $362.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table shows the changes of our assets under management by investment style for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 | Year Ended December 31, 2018
(Dollars in thousands) | Beginning Balance | Inflows (1) | Outflows (2) | Market Appreciation (Depreciation) | Ending Balance
Equity investment styles | $ | 3,511,000 | | $ | 844,000 | | $ | (565,000 | ) | $ | (371,000 | ) | $ | 3,419,000
Fixed income investment styles | 3,049,000 | | 1,588,000 | | (400,000 | ) | 26,000 | | 4,263,000 | 
Balanced investment styles | 1,749,000 | | 306,000 | | (531,000 | ) | (17,000 | ) | 1,507,000 | 
Total assets under management | $ | 8,309,000 | | $ | 2,738,000 | | $ | (1,496,000 | ) | $ | (362,000 | ) | $ | 9,189,000


(1) | Inflows consist of new assets from the Columbia acquisition of $1.07 billion, as well as other new business and contributions to existing accounts.


(2) | Outflows consist of business lost as well as distributions from existing accounts.

Competition
We operate in a very competitive industry and face significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors, particularly regional and national institutions, in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services. We compete for loans and deposits based upon the personal and responsive service offered by our highly experienced relationship managers, access to management and interest rates. As a result of our low operating costs, we believe we are able to compete for customers with the competitive interest rates that we pay on deposits and that we charge on our loans.
Our management believes that our most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, money market funds and brokerage firms, particularly national and large regional banks, which target the same customers as we do. Competition for deposit products is generally based on pricing because of the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another. Our cost of funds fluctuates with market interest rates and our ability to further reduce our cost of funds may be affected by higher rates being offered by other financial institutions. During certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities and money market mutual funds.
13

Our competition in making commercial loans comes principally from national, regional and large community banks and insurance companies. Many large national and regional commercial banks have a significant number of branch offices in the areas in which we operate. Competition for our private banking loans is more limited than for commercial loans due largely to our niche offering of loans backed by cash, marketable securities, or cash value life insurance, which represent 54% of our entire loan portfolio. Aggressive pricing policies and terms of our competitors on middle-market and private banking loans may result in a decrease in our loan origination volume and a decrease in our yield on loans. We compete for loans principally through the quality of products and service we provide to middle-market customers and private banking referral relationships, while maintaining competitive interest rates, loan fees and other loan terms.
Our relationship-based approach to business also enables us to compete with other financial institutions in attracting loans and deposits. Our relationship managers and regional presidents have significant experience in the banking industry in the markets they serve and are focused on customer service. By capitalizing on this experience and by tailoring our products and services to the specific needs of our clients, we have been successful in cultivating stable relationships with our customers and also with financial intermediaries who refer their clients to us for banking services. We believe our approach to customer relationships will assist us in continuing to compete effectively for loans and deposits in our primary markets and nationally through our private banking channel.
The investment management business is intensely competitive. In the markets where we compete, there are over 1,000 firms which we consider to be primary competitors. In addition to competition from other institutional investment management firms, Chartwell, along with the active-management industry, competes with passive index funds, exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and investment alternatives such as hedge funds. We compete for investment management business by delivering excellent investment performance with a committed customer service model.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 257 full-time equivalent employees (189 in our banking business and 68 in our investment management business).
Supervision and Regulation
The following is a summary of material laws, rules and regulations governing banks, investment management businesses and bank holding companies, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and the regulatory agencies often have broad discretion in interpreting them. We cannot predict the outcome of any future changes to these laws, regulations, regulatory interpretations, guidance and policies, which may have a material and adverse impact on the financial markets in general, and our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects.
General
The common stock and preferred stock of TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. is publicly traded and listed and, as a result, we are subject to securities laws and stock market rules, including oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules. Banking is highly regulated under federal and state law. Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) administered by the FDIC, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our investors. We are a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. TriState Capital Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is not a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC.
Our investment management business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Chartwell and CTSC Securities are subject to Federal securities laws, principally the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, state laws regarding securities fraud and regulations promulgated by various regulatory authorities, including the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), applicable state laws and stock exchanges. Our investment management business also may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies, both domestically and abroad, and the costs associated with compliance, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
This system of supervision and regulation establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations. Failure to meet regulatory standards could have a material and adverse impact on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects.

Regulatory Developments
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), enacted in 2010, has resulted in broad changes to the U.S. financial system where its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of the financial services industry. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was signed into law. While the EGRRCPA preserves the fundamental elements of the post Dodd-Frank regulatory framework, it includes modifications that are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for smaller and certain regional banking organizations.
Over several years the Department of Labor (“DOL”) developed a rule governing the circumstances in which a person rendering investment advice with respect to an employee benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 would be treated as a fiduciary for the recipient of the advice. DOL finalized a regulation in 2016, which might have affected our investment advisory business, but DOL extended the effective date, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit effectively vacated the rule in 2018. While this matter now appears to be in abeyance, the SEC is considering a comparable rule, popularly known as Regulation BI, for best interest. The SEC has not issued a proposal, however, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, such a regulation might have on our investment advisory business.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
Capital adequacy. The Federal Reserve monitors the capital adequacy of our holding company, on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities monitor the capital adequacy of TriState Capital Bank. The regulatory agencies use a combination of risk-based ratios and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy and consider these capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to safety and soundness. The current capital rules, which began to take effect in 2015, are popularly known as the Basel III Capital Rules because they are based on international standards known as Basel III. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among financial institutions and their holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk weights. Regulatory capital, in turn, is classified into three “tiers” of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 capital (“CET 1”) includes common equity, retained earnings, and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. “Tier 1” capital includes, among other things, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. “Tier 2” capital includes, among other things, qualifying subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations. Total capital is the total of all three tiers. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of average assets or total risk-weighted assets, including off-balance sheet items.
As discussed above in connection with EGRRCPA, the Company and the Bank may be able to satisfy all the capital requirements, including those under both the Basel III Capital Rules, and prompt corrective action if both entities maintain the necessary CBLR. The federal banking agencies have not yet finalized a CBLR rule and until then we cannot know whether we will qualify. Assuming that the agencies fix the CBLR at 9%, we now exceed this standard, and we believe we will continue to do so in the future.
In the meantime, the Basel III Capital Rules apply to us and require banks and bank holding companies generally to maintain four minimum capital standards to be “adequately capitalized”: (1) a tier 1 capital to total average assets ratio (“tier 1 leverage capital ratio”) of at least 4%; (2) a common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (“CET 1 risk-based capital ratio”) of at least 4.5%; (3) a tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (“tier 1 risk-based capital ratio”) of at least 6%; and (4) a total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (“total risk-based capital ratio”) of at least 8%. These capital requirements are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions, or if required by the banking regulators due to the economic conditions impacting our primary markets. For example, FDIC regulations provide that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities.
In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a capital conservation buffer (a ratio of CET1 to total risk-based assets of at least 2.5% on top of the minimum risk-based capital requirements). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625%; in 2018 the buffer was 1.875%; and the full 2.5% requirement took effect on January 1, 2019. As a result, the Company and the Bank must adhere to the following minimum capital ratios to satisfy the Basel III Capital Rule requirements and to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers:

• | 4.0% tier 1 leverage ratio;


• | minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%;


• | minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and

15


• | minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5%.

When assets are risk weighted for the purpose of the risk-based capital ratios, the Basel III Capital Rules present a large number of risk weight categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures. These categories may result in higher risk weights than under the earlier rules for a variety of asset classes, including certain commercial real estate mortgages. Additional aspects of the new capital rules that are most relevant to us include:

• | a formula-based approach, referred to as the collateral haircut approach, to determine the risk weight of eligible margin loans collateralized by liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities, where the collateral is marked to fair value daily, and the transaction is subject to daily margin maintenance requirements;


• | consistent with the prior risk-based capital rules, assigning exposures secured by single family residential properties to either a 50% risk weight for first-lien mortgages that meet prudential underwriting standards or a 100% risk weight category for all other mortgages;


• | providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (previously set at 0%);


• | assigning a 150% risk weight to all exposures that are non-accrual or 90 days or more past due (previously set at 100%), except for those secured by single family residential properties, which will be assigned a 100% risk weight, consistent with the prior risk-based capital rules;


• | applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate loans for acquisition, development and construction; and


• | the option to use a formula-based approach referred to as the simplified supervisory formula approach to determine the risk weight of various securitization tranches in addition to the previous “gross-up” method (replacing the credit ratings approach for certain securitization).

Further, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies adopted new capital requirements to address the risks that the activities of an institution poses to the institution and the public and private stakeholders, including risks arising from certain enumerated activities. Capital guidelines may continue to evolve and may have material impacts on us or our banking subsidiary.
Based on our calculations, we expect that TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. and TriState Capital Bank will meet all minimum capital requirements when effective and that we and the Bank would continue to meet all capital requirements as fully phased in without material adverse effects on our business. However, the capital rules may continue to evolve over time and future changes may have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, other restrictions on our business and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.
Prompt corrective action regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized insured depository institutions. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on its capital: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.”
16

Under the current prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC, after adopting the Basel III Capital rules, an insured depository institution generally will be classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated:

“Well capitalized” | “Adequately capitalized” 
Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%, | Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, 
CET 1 risk-based ratio of 6.5%, | CET 1 risk-based ratio of 4.5%, 
Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8%, | Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6%, and 
Total risk-based ratio of 10%, and | Total risk-based ratio of 8% 
Not subject to written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive that requires a specific capital level. | 
“Undercapitalized” | “Significantly undercapitalized” 
Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%, | Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 3%, 
CET 1 risk-based ratio less than 4.5%, | CET 1 risk-based ratio less than 3%, 
Tier 1 risk-based ratio less than 6%, or | Tier 1 risk-based ratio less than 4%, or
Total risk-based ratio less than 8% | Total risk-based ratio less than 6% 
“Critically undercapitalized” | 
Tangible equity to total assets less than 2% | 

Various consequences flow from a bank’s prompt corrective action category. A bank that is adequately capitalized but not well capitalized must obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to continue to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, banking regulators must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.
A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary bank performs under a capital restoration plan, including an obligation to contribute capital to the bank up to the lesser of 5% of an “undercapitalized” subsidiary’s assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements.
The prompt corrective action classification of a bank affects the frequency of regulatory examinations, the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities and the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank. As of December 31, 2018, TriState Capital Bank met the requirements to be categorized as “well capitalized” based on the aforementioned ratios for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations, as currently in effect.
Source of Strength Doctrine for Bank Holding Companies
Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, TriState Capital Bank. This support may be required at times when we may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans that we make to TriState Capital Bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of TriState Capital Bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of TriState Capital Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. These obligations are in addition to the performance guaranty we must provide in the event that TriState Capital Bank is required to develop a capital restoration plan under prompt corrective action.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
We must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) acquiring more than five percent of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may determine not to approve any of these transactions if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs 
17

of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also may not approve a transaction in which the resulting institution would hold a share of state or nationwide deposits in excess of certain caps. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial condition and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, whether the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system, the records of a bank holding company and its subsidiary bank(s) in compliance with applicable banking, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering laws.
Scope of Permissible Bank Holding Company Activities
In general, the Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incident thereto.
A bank holding company may elect to be treated as a financial holding company if it and its depository institution subsidiaries are categorized as “well capitalized” and “well managed.” A financial holding company may engage in a range of activities that are (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (2) complementary to a financial activity and which do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments. Expanded financial activities of financial holding companies generally will be regulated according to the type of such financial activity: banking activities by banking regulators, securities activities by securities regulators and insurance activities by insurance regulators. While we may determine in the future to become a financial holding company, we do not have an intention to make that election at this time.
The Bank Holding Company Act does not place territorial limitations on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
Dividends
As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless: (1) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries; and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Capital Rules impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends, such as limits that come into play when the capital conservation buffer falls below the required ratio. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 
A part of our income could be derived from, and a potential material source of our liquidity could be, dividends from TriState Capital Bank. The ability of TriState Capital Bank to pay dividends to us is also restricted by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. Under applicable Pennsylvania law, TriState Capital Bank may only pay cash dividends out of its accumulated net earnings, subject to certain requirements regarding the level of surplus relative to capital.
Under federal law, TriState Capital Bank may not pay any dividend to us if the Bank is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. The FDIC may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring TriState Capital Bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required for it to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the FDIC, TriState Capital Bank is engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), the FDIC may require, generally after notice and hearing, the Bank to cease such practice. The FDIC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The FDIC has also issued guidance to the effect that insured depository institutions generally should pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Incentive Compensation Guidance
The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive 
18

compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, provisions of the Basel III regime described above limit discretionary bonus payments to bank and bank holding company executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are likely to continue evolving. In 2016, the federal banking agencies, together with certain other federal agencies, proposed a regulation to limit certain incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by banks, bank holding companies, and certain other financial institutions. We do not know when the agencies will finalize this regulation and what the final requirements will be.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders
Federal law strictly limits the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, impose quantitative limits, qualitative standards, and collateral requirements on certain transactions by a bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates, and generally require those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization, including an expansion of the covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied.
Federal law also limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. In addition, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. TriState Capital Bank maintains a policy that does not permit loans to employees, including executive officers.
FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments
FDIC-insured banks are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC, which fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The assessment rate for institutions with less than $10 billion in assets is now determined by the FDIC’s financial ratios method, which takes into account seven financial ratios for each institution and the weighted average of the institution’s CAMELS composite ratings. The rate may be adjusted by the institution’s long-term unsecured debt and its brokered deposits. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. The FDIC has in past years raised assessment rates to increase funding for the Deposit Insurance Fund.
All assessment rates may change based on the reserve ratio of the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the way that deposit insurance premiums are calculated, increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. As of September 30, 2018, the DIF’s reserve ratio was 1.36%. Rates may be reduced if this ratio rises above 2.0% or 2.5%. We cannot predict how the reserve ratio may change in the future.
Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Continued action by the FDIC to replenish and increase the Deposit Insurance Fund, as well as the changes contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, may result in higher assessment rates, which could reduce our profitability or otherwise negatively impact our operations, financial condition or future prospects.
Branching and Interstate Banking
Under Pennsylvania law, TriState Capital Bank is permitted to establish additional branch offices within Pennsylvania, subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Bank is also permitted to establish additional offices outside of Pennsylvania, subject to prior regulatory approval.
TriState Capital Bank operates four representative offices, with one each located in the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and New York. Because our representative offices are not branches for purposes of applicable state law and FDIC regulations, there are restrictions on the types of activities we may conduct through our representative offices. Relationship managers in our representative offices may solicit loan and deposit products and services in their markets and act as liaisons to our headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

However, consistent with our centralized operations and regulatory requirements, we do not disburse or transmit funds, accept loan repayments or accept or contract for deposits or deposit-type liabilities through our representative offices.
Community Reinvestment Act
TriState Capital Bank has a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), and related FDIC regulations to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low-income and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of TriState Capital Bank, the FDIC is required to assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the CRA. The Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as for branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its or our activities, including additional financial activities if we elect to be treated as a financial holding company.
CRA regulations provide that a financial institution may elect to have its CRA performance evaluated under the strategic plan option. The strategic plan enables the institution to structure its CRA goals and objectives to address the needs of its community consistent with its business strategy, operational focus, capacity and constraints. In January 2018, the FDIC approved our updated strategic plan to cover the years 2018 through 2020. TriState Capital Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating in its most recent CRA examination, which covered an approximately three-year period ending on September 10, 2018.
Financial Privacy
The federal banking and securities regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. In addition to applicable federal privacy regulations, TriState Capital Bank is subject to certain state privacy laws.
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, certain financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that are reasonably designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing, including enhanced scrutiny of account relationships, and to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) including the requirement to report suspicious activities. The programs are to include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Law enforcement authorities also have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions to investigate suspected money laundering or terrorist financing. The United States Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and the federal banking agencies continue to issue regulations and guidance with respect to the application and requirements of the BSA and their expectations for effective anti-money laundering programs.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) administers laws and Executive Orders that prohibit U.S. entities from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited parties. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for bank mergers and acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and comply with OFAC sanctions, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution.
Safety and Soundness Standards
Federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines that establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. Additionally, the agencies have adopted regulations that provide the authority to order an institution that has been given 
20

notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
In addition to federal consequences for failure to satisfy applicable safety and soundness standards, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities Code grants the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities the authority to impose a civil money penalty of up to $25,000 per violation against a Pennsylvania financial institution, or any of its officers, employees, directors, or trustees for: (1) violations of any law or department order; (2) engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice; or (3) breaches of a fiduciary duty in conducting the institution’s business.
Bank holding companies are also prohibited from engaging in unsound banking practices. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. As another example, a holding company is forbidden from impairing its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believed it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries that present unsafe and unsound banking practices or that constitute violations of laws or regulations.
In addition to the agencies’ written regulations, standards and guidelines, banks and bank holding companies are regularly examined for safety and soundness by their appropriate federal and state regulators. These examinations are extensive and cover many items, including loan concentrations. At the end of an examination, a bank is assigned ratings for capital, assets, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk as well as on overall composite rating for these elements, commonly referred to as the CAMELS rating. The Federal Reserve makes comparable findings for bank holding companies. These ratings and the reports on which they are based are highly confidential and not available to the public.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
TriState Capital Bank is subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with the Bank. These laws include, among others, laws regarding unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, usury laws, and other federal consumer protection statutes. These federal laws include the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Procedures Act of 1974, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those enacted under federal law. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that has broad authority to regulate and supervise retail financial services activities of banks and various non-bank providers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, guidance and policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions with regard to consumer financial products and services. In general, banks with assets of $10 billion or less, such as TriState Capital Bank, will continue to be examined for consumer compliance by their primary federal bank regulator. Nevertheless, positions established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may become applicable to us, and the bureau has back-up enforcement authority.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
Our commercial banking business and investment management business are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates, and asset purchase programs. These policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, as well as the performance of our investment management products and services and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, established, among other things: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of the reporting company’s securities by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the twelve-month period following the initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (iv) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board; (v) standards for auditors and regulation of audits, including independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (vi) disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and their directors and executive officers, including accelerated reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension blackout periods; (vii) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; and (viii) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws.
Asset Management
The asset management industry is subject to extensive federal, state and international laws and regulations promulgated by various governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies that are intended to benefit and protect investors in products. In addition, our distribution activities also may be subject to regulation by U.S. federal agencies, self-regulatory organizations and securities commissions in those jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject, we must devote substantial time, expense and effort to remaining vigilant about, and addressing, legal and regulatory compliance matters.
Existing U.S. Regulation
Chartwell is a registered investment adviser regulated by the SEC. Chartwell is also currently subject to regulation by the Department of Labor (the “DOL”) and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as Chartwell, including recordkeeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
Chartwell’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are also regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various U.S. exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements and market regulation policies in the United States.
CTSC, our broker/dealer subsidiary, is subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business. Much of the regulation of broker/dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. These self-regulatory organizations have adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to matters such as sales practices, compensation and disclosure, and conduct periodic examinations of member broker/dealers in accordance with rules they have adopted and amended from time to time, subject to approval by the SEC. The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker/dealer, its officers or registered employees. These administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation or business of a broker/dealer. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker/dealers is the protection of clients and the securities markets, rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of the regulated entity.
There has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms, related to both retirement and taxable accounts. This includes the DOL adoption of a fiduciary rule that was ultimately struck down by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the SEC’s proposal of a package of related rules and interpretations in April 2018. The ultimate action taken by the DOL, SEC or other applicable regulatory or legislative body may impact our business activities and increase our costs.
In addition, Chartwell also may be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related regulations, particularly insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” or “investment manager” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. 
22

ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries of ERISA plan clients, and ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of ERISA plan and Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) clients and certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and several other related parties) to such clients. In April 2016, the Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, issued a final fiduciary rule expanding the circumstances in which advice furnished to retirement investors will be treated as fiduciary in nature as well as related prohibited transaction class exemptions.
Net Capital Requirements
CTSC is a non-clearing broker/dealer subsidiary with a primary business of wholesaling and marketing the proprietary investment products and services provided by Chartwell. CTSC is subject to net capital rules imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities that mandate that it maintain certain levels of capital.
Impact of Current Laws and Regulations
The cumulative effect of these laws and regulations, while providing certain benefits, add significantly to the cost of our operations and thus have a negative impact on our profitability. There has also been a notable expansion in recent years of financial service providers that are not subject to the examination, oversight, and other rules and regulations to which we are subject. Those providers, because they are not so highly regulated, may have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Reform
New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Future legislation and policies, and the effects of that legislation and those policies, may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. Such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects of commercial banks and investment management businesses in the past and are expected to continue.
