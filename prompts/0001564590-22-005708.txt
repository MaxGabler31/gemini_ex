Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 We are a global company that turns ideas into innovative, high-performance and premium networking products that connect people, power businesses and service providers, and advance the way people live. We operate and report in two segments: Connected Home, and Small and Medium Business (“SMB”). The Connected Home segment focuses on consumers and provides high-performance, dependable and easy-to-use WiFi internet networking solutions such as WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E Tri-band and Quad-band mesh systems, routers, 4G/5G mobile products, smart devices such as Meural digital canvasses, and subscription services that provide consumers a range of value- added benefits focused on performance, security, privacy and premium support. The SMB segment focuses on small and medium sized businesses and provides solutions for business networking, wireless local area network (“LAN”), audio and video over Ethernet for Pro AV applications, security, and remote management providing enterprise-class functionality at an affordable price. We conduct business across three geographic territories: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
 In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we generated net revenue of $1.17 billion, $1.26 billion, and $998.8 million, respectively.
 COVID-19 Pandemic

 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global economies, supply chains, workforce participation, inflation, and has created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a considerable shift in our business while increasing uncertainty. We have experienced an increase in demand for our products relative to pre-pandemic levels as consumers and businesses seek flexible networking solutions for their day-to-day needs. As a result of the ongoing pandemic, our supply chain partners are limited by production capacity, and constrained by material availability, factory uptime and freight capacity, resulting in elongated lead times for some of our key components, impeding our ability to accurately forecast and to capitalize fully on end market demand. As the pandemic continues to disrupt the global business environment, it impacts our ability to fulfill SMB product demand and limits the availability of certain Connected Home products. In 2021, we experienced meaningful increases in costs for sea freight transportation, as well as costs of materials and components for our products. We expect these costs to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, with sea freight transportation costs starting to come down from current highs in the second half of 2022.

Markets
 Our mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet by providing advanced, high-performance and premium networking technologies and internet-connected products for consumers, businesses and service providers. There are a number of factors that are driving today’s demand for products within these markets. The ever-growing number of internet-connected devices, such as smart phones, TVs, laptops, tablets, smart-home devices, and other Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has increased the need for more robust networking solutions. As consumer behavior shifts to more content and video streaming, online gaming, online shopping, work-, fitness- and schooling-from-home, the demand for high-performance, dependable and secure WiFi continues to increase. Rising cyber security threats and attacks continue to propel the need for devices connected to the network to be free from vulnerability, leading to an increase in the demand for our security and privacy services. The demand for more convenience, greater speed, expanded coverage range, security and reliability of an in-home WiFi network, as well as mobile cellular networks, have become a greater priority for households and businesses.
 Over the last decade, technology transformation has driven a need for constant connectivity. Consumers, small businesses and service providers demand networking products, incorporating the latest technology, that fit their specific needs and budgets. In particular, high income consumers with large numbers of connected devices and fast broadband subscriptions are investing in premium home WiFi solutions, such as our Orbi WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E Tri-band and Quad-band Mesh products. While there is always a need for point solutions that enhance or extend the functionality provided by internet service providers, there is also a growing demand for premium WiFi devices and networks that combine the newest WiFi standards with elegant design and a seamless app experience to accommodate the end-to-end networking needs of homes that are becoming increasingly smarter. End users desiring faster WiFi speeds, capacity for more devices and lower latency than ever before also often lack the technical skills or resources to fully realize these capabilities, making “plug and play” setup and ease of use priorities. Consumers and businesses also prefer the convenience of obtaining networking solutions from a single company and a positive customer experience has shown to produce brand loyalty. We recognize that customers see reliability, usability, security and performance as key factors when purchasing products and services. To provide desirable products and services at attractive prices, we focus on the unique requirements of these markets, and exercise strong operational discipline.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our products and services are designed to meet the specific needs of the consumer, business and service provider markets. We tailor various elements of the software interface, product design, including component specification, physical characteristics such as casing, design and coloration, and specific user interface features to meet the needs of these markets. We also leverage many of our technological developments, high volume manufacturing, technical support and engineering infrastructure across our markets to maximize business efficiencies. In our Connected Home business, our core long-term strategy focuses on the premium and higher-margin segments of the market, where we demonstrate our highly differentiated technology leadership.
 Our products that target the business market are generally designed with an industrial appearance, including metal cases and, for some product categories, the ability to mount the product within standard data networking racks as well as unique mounting solutions for other uses. These products typically include higher port counts, higher data transfer rates and other performance characteristics designed to meet the needs of a modern business. For example, our business products provide data transfer rates up to ten gigabits per second to meet the higher capacity requirements. Our newest Power over Ethernet (“PoE”)++ switches, including cloud managed and unmanaged PoE switches, provide elevated power budgets and uninterrupted PoE++ power for businesses of all sizes to address the growing need for deployment of multiple PoE devices with more power, due to the widespread adoption of IP communication, security cameras, WiFi access points, proximity sensors, and various other new applications. Some of these products are also designed to support transmission modes such as fiber optic cabling, which is common in more sophisticated business environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a shift in the demand and use cases for SMB products as more small businesses are now running out of homes. Products like our Orbi Pro with VLAN management, and our access points coupled with plug and play PoE VLAN switches are simple and cost-effective solutions that enable network segregation in homes between business and personal use. This shift has contributed to growing the market for lower port count switches and our SMB wireless offerings. In addition, we continue to see a shift from traditional AV applications utilizing HDMI technology to Ethernet switching driven by a transition from the 1080p to 4K to 8K video, and broadcast moving towards multicast streaming. We continue to develop and pursue avenues like health, personal fitness and sports industries for deployment of our next generation AV systems that transport audio and video signals over Ethernet.
 Security requirements within our products for business broadband access include firewall and VPN capabilities that allow for secure interactions between remote offices and business headquarter locations over the internet. Our connectivity product offerings for the business market include enhanced security and remote configurability often required in a business setting.
 Our vision for the home network is about intelligently controlling and monitoring all devices connected to the home network at all times, thus creating a Smart Environment. Our Connected Home business continues to make progress on our core long-term strategy of focusing on the premium and higher-margin segments of the market, where we demonstrate highly differentiated technology. Our focus is to continue to introduce new products and services into growth areas that form the basis of Smart Homes, such as: the fastest WiFi standards with broadest coverage via latest technology (802.11ax) WiFi routers and home WiFi systems; high speed DOCSIS 3.1, xDSL and fiber gateways with 
 6


more integrated functions; 5G mobile gateways and mobile hotspots; and Digital Canvasses. We continue to announce and introduce new products in these key markets.
 Our vision for the business network is to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and supportability of the hybrid cloud access network. We believe small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to move into cloud-based applications, such as: Salesforce.com, Ring Central, Zoom video conferencing, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, and others. In addition, we believe these enterprises will move into utility-like on-demand computing power supplied by third-party data centers. With the increased adoption of hybrid and fully remote work environments, along with increases in new businesses being established at home, we see a need for greater networking capabilities as workforces become more dispersed. We believe that the need for cost efficient and easy-to-use video surveillance by small businesses and corporate offices will continue to grow and fuel the growth of our PoE(+) market, with its ability to power 4K cameras. These trends will place a greater demand on business networks. To meet this demand, we are introducing next-generation technology, such as: PoE switches, Multi-gigabit Ethernet switches, WiFi mesh systems, high capacity local and remote unified storage, small to medium capacity campus wireless LAN, audio and video over Ethernet for Pro AV applications, and security and privacy appliances. In addition, our Insight line of cloud-connected networking devices can be managed remotely and securely via mobile Apps or Browser interfaces, providing continuous monitoring and instantaneous fault notification.
 Competition
 The consumer, business and service provider markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our principal competitors include:

• | within the consumer markets, companies such as ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Devolo, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Linksys (owned by Foxconn), Minim (owned by Motorola), Google WiFi, Samsung, Synology, and TP- Link;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | within the business markets, companies such as Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Buffalo, Cisco Systems, Dell, D-Link, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Palo Alto Networks, QNAP Systems, SonicWall, Synology, TP- Link, Ubiquiti, and WatchGuard; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | within the service provider markets, companies such as Actiontec, Airties, Arcadyan, ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Compal Broadband, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Franklin, Google, Hitron, Huawei, Inseego, Nokia, Plume, Sagem, Sercomm, SMC Networks, TechniColor, TP-Link, Ubee, ZTE and ZyXEL. Other competitors include numerous local vendors such as Xiaomi in China, AVM in Germany and Buffalo in Japan.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our potential competitors include other consumer electronics vendors, including Apple, Lifelock, LG Electronics, McAfee, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio, who could integrate networking and streaming capabilities into their line of products, such as televisions, set top boxes and gaming consoles, and our channel customers who may decide to offer self-branded networking products. We also face competition from service providers who may bundle a free networking device with their broadband service offering, including Extreme Networks and Luxul, which would reduce our sales if we were not the supplier of choice to those service providers. In the service provider space, we also face significant and increased competition from original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and contract manufacturers (“CMs”) who are selling and attempting to sell their products directly to service providers around the world.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, they may have more advanced technology, larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, better customer service and access to more customers than we do. For example, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has significant brand name recognition and has an advertising presence substantially greater than ours. Similarly, Cisco Systems is well recognized as a leader in providing networking products to businesses, while Google and Amazon compete in the consumer WiFi product market, and both have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Several of our competitors, such as TP-Link, offer a range of products that directly compete with most of our product offerings. Several of our other competitors compete in a more limited manner. For example, Dell sells networking products primarily targeted at larger businesses or enterprises while Google and Amazon primarily only sell WiFi mesh systems. The competitive environment in which we operate changes rapidly due to technological reasons and other factors outside of our control, 
 7


such as new entrants to the market and the ability of market participants to adapt to changing environments, such as impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Other companies with significant resources could also become direct competitors, either through acquiring a competitor or through internal efforts.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer, business and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth, price points, size and scope of the sales channel, brand name, timeliness of new product introductions, product availability, performance, features, functionality and reliability, ease-of-installation, maintenance and use, security and privacy, and customer service and support. We believe our products are competitive in these markets based on these factors.
 To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to aggressively invest resources in developing new products and subscription services, enhancing our current products, expanding our sales channels including our direct to consumer capabilities, increasing engagement with our customers and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. Our investments reflect our enhanced focus on the security of our products and systems, as the threat of cyber-attacks and exploitation of potential security vulnerabilities in our industry is on the rise and is increasingly a significant consumer concern.
 Research and Development
 Our success depends on our ability to develop products that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and proactively respond to evolving technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. Accordingly, we have made investments in our research and development department in order to effectively evaluate existing and new third-party technologies, develop existing and new in-house technologies, and develop and test new products and services. Our research and development employees work closely with our technology and manufacturing partners to bring high quality new products and services to market in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
 We identify, qualify and create new technologies to develop products using one or both of the methodologies described below. Under both ODM and In-House development, we develop portions of the software on some products, including embedded firmware or components of firmware, mobile applications, and cloud software.
 ODM. Under the ODM methodology, we define the product concept and specifications and recommend the technology selection. We then coordinate with our technology suppliers as they develop the product, meeting our specifications, while our internal software engineering team typically works with our service partners to develop the software services that run on these devices. On certain new products, one or more subsystems of the design can be done in-house and then integrated with the remaining design pieces from the ODM. Once prototypes are completed, we work with our partners to complete the debugging and systems integration and testing. After completion of the final tests, agency approvals and product documentation, the product is released for production and shipment.
 In-House Development. Under the in-house development model, one or more subsystems of the product are designed and developed utilizing the NETGEAR engineering team. Under this model, some of the primary technology is developed in-house. We then work closely with either an ODM or a Joint Development Manufacturer (“JDM”) to complete the development of the entire design, perform the necessary testing, and obtain regulatory approvals before the product is released for production and shipment.
 Manufacturing
 Our primary manufacturers are Cloud Network Technology (more commonly known as Hon Hai Precision or Foxconn Corporation), Delta Electronics Incorporated, Wistron NeWeb Corporation, and Pegatron Corporation, all of which are headquartered in Taiwan. We also manufacture in Haiphong, Vietnam at a facility owned by Shenzhen Gongjin Electronics Co., Ltd. (more commonly known as T&W), which is headquartered in China. We manufacture US bound products in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. We distribute our manufacturing among a limited number of key suppliers and seek to avoid excessive concentration with any one single supplier. Currently, however, we have a concentration among two of our major suppliers in South East Asia that we expect will continue through fiscal year 2022. Any disruptions from natural disasters, health epidemics and political, social and economic instability would affect the ability of our manufacturers to manufacture our products. If our manufacturing or warehousing facilities are disrupted or destroyed, we would not have readily available alternatives for manufacturing our products and our business would be significantly impacted. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our 
 8


products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, in July 2021 we established our own product quality organization based in Singapore and Taiwan. The organization is responsible for auditing and inspecting product quality on the premises of our ODMs. 
 We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources. These include many of the semiconductors used in our products, which are designed specifically for the products and obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis like switching fabric semiconductors used in our Ethernet switches and internet gateway products; wireless local area network chipsets used in our wireless products and mobile network chipsets which are used in our wireless gateways and hotspots. We also have limited sources for components including connector jacks, plastic casings and physical layer transceivers. Our third-party manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis. If these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or component lead times deviate from expectations, our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries would be harmed and we may lose sales and experience increased costs to procure supply. For instance, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply shortages for core networking semiconductor components, and additionally power IC and voltage regulator chipsets due to high demand, resulting in elongated manufacturing timelines.
 We currently outsource warehousing and distribution logistics to four main third-party providers who are responsible for warehousing, distribution logistics and order fulfillment. In addition, these parties are also responsible for some configuration and re-packaging of our products including bundling components to form kits, inserting appropriate documentation, disk drive configuration, and adding power adapters. APL Logistics Americas, Ltd. in City of Industry, California serves the Americas region, Kerry Logistics Ltd. in Singapore, serves the Asia Pacific region, DSV Solutions B.V. Netherlands serves the EMEA region, and Likewize Logistics Pty Ltd. in Melbourne, VIC, Australia serves Australia and New Zealand.
 Sales and Marketing
 We work directly with our customers on market development activities, such as co-advertising, online promotions and video demonstrations, live and virtual event sponsorships and sales associate training. We also participate in major industry trade shows and marketing events. Our marketing department is comprised of our channel marketing, product marketing and corporate marketing groups.
 Our channel marketing team focuses on working with the sales teams to maximize our participation in channel partner marketing activities and merchandise our products both online and in store.
 Our product marketing group focuses on product and service strategy, product and service development roadmaps, the new product introduction process, product lifecycle management, demand assessment and competitive analysis. The group works closely with our sales and research and development groups to align our product development roadmap to meet customer technology demands from a strategic perspective. The group also ensures that product and services development activities, product and services launches, and ongoing demand and supply planning for our products occur in a well-managed, timely basis in coordination with our development, manufacturing, and sales groups, as well as our ODM and sales channel partners.
 Our corporate marketing group is responsible for defining and building our corporate brand, supporting the business units with creative marketing strategies and driving traffic to our online and in-app platforms. The group focuses on defining our brand promise and marketing messages on a worldwide basis. This group is also responsible for driving awareness and demand for NETGEAR products through paid, earned and owned channels to reach and acquire new customers. Marketing tactics include driving the social media and online marketing strategy, public relations, installed base marketing programs, community engagement programs, sponsorships and events, and corporate websites worldwide, as well as creative production for all product categories.
 We conduct most of our international sales and marketing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, which operate via sales and marketing subsidiaries and branch offices worldwide.

Customer Support
 We design our products with ease-of-use top of mind. We respond globally to customer inquiries through a variety of channels including phone, chat, community, social media, and email. Customers can also get self-help service through the comprehensive knowledgebase and the user forums on our website. Customer support is provided through a combination of a limited number of permanent employees and use of subcontracted, out-sourced resources. Our permanent employees design our technical support model and process and are responsible for training and managing our outsourced sub-contractors. They also handle escalations from the outsourced resources. We utilize the information gained from customers by our customer support organization to enhance our product offerings, including further simplifying the installation process.
Intellectual Property
 We believe that our continued success will depend primarily on the technical expertise, speed of technology implementation, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees, plus ownership of a limited but important set of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent laws, nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We hold approximately 234 issued United States patents that expire between years 2022 and 2040 and 40 foreign patents that expire between 2022 and 2036. In addition, we currently have approximately 21 pending United States and foreign patent applications related to technology and products offered by us. We also rely on third-party licensors for patented hardware and software license rights in technology that are incorporated into and are necessary for the operation and functionality of our products. Our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to these technologies.
 We have trade secret rights for our products, consisting mainly of product design, technical product documentation and software. We also own, or have applied for registration of trademarks, in connection with our products in the United States and internationally, including NETGEAR, NETGEAR Armor, NETGEAR Insight, NPG, NPG logo, Orbi, Nighthawk, FASTLANE3, Meural, Trueart, Digital Canvas, and ProSafe.
 We have registered a number of internet domain names that we use for electronic interaction with our customers including dissemination of product information, marketing programs, product registration, sales activities, and other commercial uses.
 Seasonal Business
 We have historically experienced increased net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first and second quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand from consumer markets primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. This pronounced seasonality has been previously offset by irregular and significant purchases from customers in other markets, such as the service provider market. However, we did not experience such seasonality in 2021 as we continued to see increased demand in the first half of 2021 directly tied to the COVID-19 pandemic which normalized in the second half of 2021. We anticipate the pattern of seasonality experienced historically to resume in 2022, due to the aforementioned consumer trends, as well as an expected improvement in supply of our SMB products.
Governmental Regulations 
          Environmental Laws
 Our products and manufacturing process are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory effects on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current 
 10


government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and compliance efforts to ensure that we, and our suppliers, are in compliance with all existing regulations.
 Other Regulations
 As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in “Risk Factors – Financial, Legal, Regulatory and Tax Compliance Risks”.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 771 full-time employees, with 259 in sales, marketing and technical support, 280 in research and development, 96 in operations, and 136 in finance, information systems and administration. We also utilize a number of temporary staff to supplement our workforce. We have never had a work stoppage among our employees, no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Culture
 
        Our mission to connect the world using innovative networking products cannot be achieved without employing imaginative, talented and committed individuals from around the world. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive environment that both attracts and retains team members who align with our core values of: achievement, simplicity, people, innovation, results, and ethics. 
 
        We strive to create a respectful work environment characterized by mutual trust and the absence of intimidation, oppression, discrimination and exploitation, and we believe that nurturing this type of environment allows for the opportunity to turn creative ideas into innovative products.
 
Recruitment and Retention
 
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices. We conduct employee engagement surveys every two years and on an ad hoc basis in order to assess ways in which we can improve employee satisfaction, and then incorporate feedback from these surveys into our culture and operations.
 
To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer a wide range of programs and avenues for support, motivation, and professional recognition. We utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to provide training courses to ensure the professional development of our employees. 
 
We offer compelling global incentives to reinforce our performance-driven culture and attract and reward leading talent. We offer global competitive and meaningful total rewards programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. Our total rewards approach is designed to deliver cash, equity, and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by comparable companies in the technology industry and reflect anticipated local market demands and evolving business needs. Other than the base salary program, all of our cash and equity programs are dependent upon the achievement of individual and company performance. In addition 
 11


to competitive salaries and bonuses, we grant equity-based compensation to a significant portion of our employees. Equity serves as a key component in attracting, retaining, and motivating our employees. We also provide the opportunity for equity ownership through our employee stock purchase plan. We provide competitive benefits that include retirement planning, health care, parental leave, flexible time away, and appreciation events for employees. In addition, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 

We believe that our employee population should be reflective of the communities where we live and serve, and we are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. A diverse environment representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures and where everyone feels like they belong fosters innovative ideas and best-in-class products. We strive to create the most innovative products for our customers, and we recognize that it takes true diversity and inclusion to unleash the power of our fullest potential. We work every day to go beyond accepting diversity - we celebrate it, we support it, and we cultivate it by offering ongoing development programs, including CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion and Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”) for Black employees and women.
 
             We demonstrate diversity, equity, and inclusion at the highest levels of our company. As of December 31, 2021, fifty percent (50%) of our independent directors are female, and approximately 55% of our executive management team self-identify as diverse, in terms of race, ethnicity or gender. In addition, women represented approximately 23% in technical positions worldwide and approximately 35% in leadership roles worldwide.
 
COVID-19 response
 
            In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes that during the first quarter of 2020, we transitioned to have the vast majority of our employees work from home whenever possible and continue to do so, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, such as engineering. The flexible work experiences have enabled our teams to remain connected with each other and with our customers while maintaining and enhancing productivity, operational excellence and innovation. We provided additional benefits to employees including a wellbeing allowance and pandemic time off. 
 
Business ethics
 
              Ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. Our Code of Ethics serves as the foundation for our corporate governance policy and guides how we conduct business every day, both internally and with our partners. We regularly convey our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and in processes and controls. We conduct presentations on our commitment to integrity and business ethics at all new hire training sessions and at each quarterly all hands meeting. We conduct annual trainings related to global ethical behavior and compliance with applicable laws, diversity and inclusion, anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations, along with enforcement and other dimensions of ethical conduct. We also maintain an ethics-related hotline, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns they have about business behavior they do not feel comfortable discussing personally with managers or human resources personnel. We also are committed to responsible manufacturing of our products and responsible sourcing of materials. We require our suppliers to share in this commitment and have established the Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations of our suppliers in conducting business in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner.
 
Community Involvement
 
         We believe in giving back to communities where we live and work. We encourage our employees to participate in community service activities and provide time off for them to do so. In addition, we donate both time and resources to non-profit organizations around the world.
