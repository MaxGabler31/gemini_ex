We have approximately 2,000 language scientists, developers, and engineers dedicated to continually refining our technologies and advancing our portfolio to better meet our customers’ diverse and changing needs. As of September 30, 2019, we had more than 80 international operating locations and a sales presence in more than 85 countries. Our corporate headquarters is in Burlington, Massachusetts, and our international headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. In fiscal year 2019, our revenue was approximately $1.8 billion.
In fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors and management undertook a comprehensive review of our long-term strategy and our business and developed a strategic plan to simplify our operations and focus on our Healthcare and Enterprise segments. In fiscal 2019, we continued to execute on this plan, including by means of the sale of the Imaging business segment, the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business, and the continued wind-down of our Devices business. On October 1, 2019, we completed the previously announced spin-off of our Automotive business segment.
Our Strategy 
With the sale of our Imaging segment, the spin-off our Automotive segment, the exit of our Mobile Operator Services business and the wind-down of Devices, we are positioned to be simpler and more growth-oriented company, which enables us to prioritize and execute our conversational AI strategies on Healthcare ad Enterprise. The key elements of our strategy include:
1


• | Transitioning to cloud-based solutions in Healthcare. We are transitioning our Healthcare solutions to the cloud, enabling us to shift our revenue mix to a more subscription-based, higher-value recurring model. We’ve established Nuance as a cloud platform in all our solution areas within Healthcare. During the year, we made significant progress migrating incremental Dragon Medical on-premise customers to the cloud with Dragon Medical One (DMO). We launched the new cloud solutions, including PowerScribe One for our radiology base, and CDE One for clinical documentation improvement programs. We have created a go-to-market approach that aligns sales compensation to our cloud models, and have enabled our channel to sell Dragon Medical cloud. We also launched new Dragon Medical cloud offerings in certain international markets, including Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.

While we maintain leadership in Voice IVR offerings, we are increasing our focus on Intelligent Engagement growth opportunies, which includes live and virtual engagement offerings, as well as Security and Biometrics. We recently launched Nuance Gatekeeper, a new cloud-native voice biometrics and authentication solution. We expanded the cloud-native stack with the roll-out of Intelligent Engagement Services for Conversational AI, Messaging, and Agent AI. These solutions offer customers more flexible integration with third-party systems and the ability to deploy across hosted, public, or private cloud. It gives large enterprises more options for deployment while making Nuance technology available to smaller organizations via the cloud model. 


• | Expanding our go-to-market presence. We are increasing sales coverage in new markets and developing new solutions to increase our customer lifetime value. In Healthcare, we are pursuing under-served markets, including community hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and surgery centers. We also are launching new solutions for specialty areas such as pediatrics, the emergency department, and surgical, as well as increasing our federal and other government customer offerings. In Enterprise, we are expanding our Intelligent Engagement solutions into our existing IVR customer base and delivering new rapid AI development tools that will allow us to increase our penetration into mid-market accounts.


• | Expanding internationally. In Healthcare, we continue to expand our international presence in the UK, France, DACH region, Nordics, Australia, and Canada with a growing direct sales force and new offerings. In Enterprise, we continue to expand our international presence in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada with expanded Intelligent Engagement offerings and sales focus.


• | Accelerating our innovation activities. We are accelerating investment in research and development, with a focus on new AI products, including our development of ambient clinical intelligence (“ACI”), sub-specialty solutions, and the AI Marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging in Healthcare. In Enterprise, we launched Nuance Gatekeeper, a new cloud-native voice biometrics solution for authentication and fraud prevention across voice and digital channels and rapid AI development tools for large and mid-market enterprises. In addition, we launched Nuance Lightning Engine, within our Security Suite, which combines NLU with voice biometrics to personalize responses and validate individuals faster than before.


• | Growing through targeted acquisitions and strategic investments. While organic growth is our priority, we also expect to selectively pursue acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies that advance the strategies described above.

Segments
As of September 30, 2019, we had four reportable segments: Healthcare, Enterprise, Automotive, and Other. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments. We offer our solutions and technologies to our customers in a variety of ways, including via hosted cloud-based solutions, perpetual and term software licenses, implementation and custom solution development services and maintenance and support. Our product revenues include embedded original equipment manufacturer ("OEMs") royalties, traditional perpetual licensing, term-based licensing and consumer sales. Our hosting, royalty, term license and maintenance and support revenues are recurring in nature as our customers use our products on an ongoing basis to handle their needs in medical transcription, medical coding and compliance, enterprise customer service and automotive connected services. Our professional services offer a continuing revenue stream, whether it is provided in connection with our software solutions or on a standalone basis, as we have a backlog of engagements that take time to complete.

In connection with our strategic business transformation, on November 19, 2018, we announced our intent to spin off our Automotive business into an independent publicly traded company through a pro rata distribution to our common stockholders. The spin-off was completed on October 1, 2019.
Other
Our Other segment includes our Subscriber Revenue Services ("SRS") and Devices businesses. Our SRS business has two components: (1) the provision of value-added services to mobile operators in India and Brazil (“Mobile Operator Services”) and (2) the provision of voicemail transcription services to mobile operators in the rest of the world (“Voicemail-to-Text ”). Our Devices business provides speech recognition solutions and predictive text technologies for handset devices. Within our SRS business, our Mobile Operator Services business experienced dramatic market disruptions during fiscal year 2018. In addition, the revenue of our Devices business has been declining due to the ongoing consolidation of our handset manufacturer customer base and continued erosion of our penetration of the remaining market. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with our comprehensive portfolio and business review efforts, we commenced a wind-down of our Devices and Mobile Operator Services businesses, which, when completed, will leave our Voicemail-to-Text business in our Other segment. In May 2019, we completed the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business in Brazil, and in July 2019, we completed the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business in India. The sale prices and any gains or losses were immaterial.
Other segment revenues were $61.5 million, $109.1 million, and $133.8 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total segment revenue, Other segment revenues represented 3.4%, 5.9% and 7.6% in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Discontinued Operations
Our previous Imaging segment provides software solutions and expertise that help professionals and organizations gain optimal control of their document and information processes by enabling customers to achieve measurable business and productivity benefits as they securely create, use and share documents. The Imaging portfolio of products and services helps business customers achieve compliance with information security policies and regulations while enabling organizations to streamline and eliminate gaps across their document work flows. Imaging revenues were $67.4 million, $209.4 million, and $211.2 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
On November 11, 2018, we entered into a definitive sale agreement with Project Leopard AcquireCo Limited (an affiliate of Kofax, Inc.) (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which we agreed to sell our Imaging business and associated assets. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of the business and received approximately $400.0 million, after estimated transaction expenses, and subject to post-closing finalization of those adjustments as set forth in the sale agreement, Imaging's results of operations have been included within discontinued operations and its assets and liabilities within held for sale on our consolidated financial statements.
Intellectual Property
Over our history, we have developed and acquired extensive technology assets, intellectual property, and industry expertise in ASR and NLU technologies that provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. Our technologies are based on complex algorithms that require extensive amounts of acoustic and language models, and recognition and understanding techniques. A significant investment in capital and time would be necessary to replicate our current capabilities.
We continue to invest in technologies to maintain our market-leading position and to develop new applications. We rely on a portfolio of patents, copyrights, trademarks, services marks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. As of September 30, 2019, we held approximately 3,550 patents and 450 patent applications. As of October 1, 2019, following the spin-off of our Automotive business segment, we held approximately 2,450 patents and 350 patent applications. Our intellectual property is critical to our success and competitive position. 
Competition
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technology changes. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop solutions and technologies that compete in our target markets; however, currently no company directly competes with us across all of our solutions and technologies. While we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants, we believe that we will compete effectively based on many factors, including:

• | Specialized Professional Services. Our superior technology, when coupled with the high quality and domain knowledge of our professional services organization, allows our customers and partners to place a high degree of confidence and trust in our ability to deliver results. We support our customers in designing and building powerful innovative solutions that specifically address their needs and requirements.

Our ability to address the needs of specific markets, such as financial, law, healthcare and government, and to introduce new solutions and technologies quickly and effectively is provided by our direct sales force, our extensive global network of resellers, comprising system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and distributors, and our e-commerce website. 

Our Healthcare segment competes primarily with Optum, 3M and other smaller providers. Our former Automotive business competed with Amazon, Google, iFlyTek and Microsoft as well as with other, smaller vendors, particularly in China. Also, some of our partners such as Avaya, Cisco, and Genesys develop and market products that might be considered substitutes for our Enterprise solutions. Additionally, a number of smaller companies in voice recognition, natural language understanding, and text input offer technologies or products that are competitive with our solutions. 
Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers.
Some of our competitors or potential competitors, such as Adobe, Google, and 3M, have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.
