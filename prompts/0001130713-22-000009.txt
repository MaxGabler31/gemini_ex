 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or in Section 1A under the heading "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Introduction
Through our online business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, décor, area rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement, outdoor, and kitchen and dining items, among others. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co, www.overstock.ca, and www.overstockgovernment.com (referred to collectively as the "Website") and through our mobile app. Although our four websites are located at different domain addresses with different interfaces, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all four websites. 
Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded as a Utah limited liability company ("LLC") in 1997, reorganized as a C Corporation in the State of Utah in 1998, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2002. We launched our initial website in March 1999. As used herein, "Overstock", "Overstock.com", "the Company", "we", "our" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
Our Business
Our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize "Dream Homes for All", particularly for our target customers—consumers who seek smart value on quality, stylish merchandise at competitive prices. We offer millions of products of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). We believe that the furniture and home goods market, which is highly fragmented and has traditionally been served by brick and mortar stores, will continue transitioning to online sales as consumers become increasingly comfortable shopping online. We continuously add newness to our product assortment to meet the evolving trends and preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include furniture, décor, area rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement, outdoor, and kitchen and dining items, among others. We compete primarily based on:
•Simple and easy customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and quality with a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care;
•Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with an intuitive shopping experience;
•Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home furnishings category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience; 
•Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which numbered approximately 3,000 as of December 31, 2021; and
•Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention.
For 2021, nearly all our retail sales through our Website were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders through our network of approximately 3,000 third-party manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") selling on our Website. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our retail partners. We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our supply chain allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our warehouses. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from direct sales of our partners' owned inventory, including some customer returns of partner products. 
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 our sales were almost entirely to customers located in the United States and no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue. 
Additional Offerings
We offer additional products or services that may complement our primary retail offerings but are not significant to our revenues, including: 
•Businesses advertising products or services on our Website;
•Market Partner, a service we provide to our partners where they can sell their products through third party sites;
•Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers; and
•Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network.
Manufacturer, Distributor, and Supplier Relationships
To the extent possible we maintain manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and seek new manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Generally, our manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers regularly communicate to us the quantity of products that are held in reserve for us, but our arrangements with them generally do not guarantee the availability of those products for a set duration. Our manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships are based on historical experience and are generally non-exclusive and we retain the right to select and change our suppliers at our discretion. Generally, manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers do not control the terms under which products are sold through our Website.
Sales and Marketing
We use a variety of methods to target our retail consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail, and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, video on demand, radio, print ads, social media, and event sponsorships.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing superior customer service. We staff our customer service department with dedicated in-house and outsourced professionals who respond to phone, SMS, instant online chat, and e-mail inquiries on products, ordering, shipping status, returns, and other areas of customer inquiry.
Technology
We use our internally developed Website and a combination of proprietary technologies, open source technologies, and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to support our operations. We use the services of multiple telecommunications companies to obtain connectivity to the Internet. Currently, our primary computer infrastructure is in a data center in Utah. We also have other data centers and public cloud providers which we use for backups, redundancy, development, testing, disaster recovery, and corporate systems infrastructure.
Competition
E-commerce is intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. We believe that competition in this industry is based predominantly on:
•price;
•product quality and assortment;
•shopping convenience;
•website organization and load speed;
•order processing and fulfillment;
•order delivery time and accuracy;
•customer service;
•website functionality on mobile devices;
•brand recognition; and
•brand reputation.
We compete with other online pure play, brick-and-mortar, and omni channel retailers which may specifically adopt our methods and target our customers. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies that specialize in several broad categories, including discount general retailers, private sales, specialty retailers, and liquidators.
Our current and potential e-commerce competitors include entities that may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, any of them may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies, including exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors or service suppliers that could deny us access to key products or needed services, or acquisitions of our suppliers or service providers, having the same effect. Many of them do or could devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their website and systems development than we do. Many have supply chain operations that decrease product shipping times to their customers, have options for in-store product pick-up, allow in-store returns, or offer other delivery and returns options that we do not have. New technologies, the continued enhancement of existing technologies, developments in related areas such as same-day product deliveries, and the development of proprietary delivery systems increase competitive pressures on us. 
Financial Information about Business Segments and Geographic Areas
As described further in Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 22—Business Segments, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists of one reportable segment, Retail, which primarily consists of amounts earned through e-commerce product sales through our Website. We use pre-tax net income (loss) as the measure to determine our reportable segments. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 22—Business Segments for information regarding our business segments and geographical areas.
Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
We regard our domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
From time to time, we receive claims and become subject to regulatory investigations or other governmental actions, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. We also prosecute lawsuits to enforce our legal rights. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any litigation may be costly and time consuming and can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any such litigation may result in significant damages, associated costs, or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business. Any such matters may materially harm our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
These matters and other types of claims could result in legal expenses, fines, adverse judgments or settlements and increase the cost of doing business. They could also require us to change our business practices in expensive and significant ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that may limit our current or future business, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise increase our costs.
Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.
For further information, see (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors") and the information set forth under Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies, Legal proceedings and contingencies, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, mandates, and regulations, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our business, and others of which apply to us for other reasons, such as our status as a publicly held company or the places in which we sell certain types or amounts of products. Our business is subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, and other services we offer. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may impede our growth. Applicable and potentially applicable regulations and laws include regulations and laws regarding taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, import and export matters, information reporting requirements, access to our services and facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling and unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Our business outside of the U.S. exposes us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, advertising practices, online services, the use of cryptocurrency, the importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.
Human Capital Management
On December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,350 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is high, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff. Overstock places great value on its human capital management and knows its people are critical to driving the business to success. We focus on our human capital management in many ways including:
Diversity & Inclusion
We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our decision-making. We know that fostering an inclusive culture delivers better business outcomes. Our commitments to improving diversity include 1) increasing the diversity of our team at all levels, 2) continuing real and meaningful gender and race dialogue within our Company, 3) amplifying the voices of our underrepresented groups of employees, 4) fostering inclusion and safety within our workforce, 5) expanding our Company volunteer time off program to include efforts to combat gender and racial injustice, 6) continuing to condemn all forms of gender and racial discrimination and harassment, 7) encouraging our employees to vote by expanding our paid time off program, and 8) tracking and monitoring our progress. Among the many ways we demonstrate these commitments are through our hiring and development practices, flexible and working-parent-friendly programs, anti-discrimination policies, and efforts of our employee resource groups. 
Through our commitments, actions, words, investments, and values, we promote a work environment that enables employees to feel safe to express their ideas and perspectives and feel they belong within our team. 
Workforce Compensation & Pay Equity
The total rewards philosophy of Overstock is to create and maintain competitive programs that attract, motivate, develop, and retain employees based on the prevailing industry and geographic labor markets where the Company does business. Competitive compensation programs consist of cash and non-cash compensation based on relevant pay factors designed to balance market competitiveness and cost containment to retain the human capital that enables the Company to achieve business performance goals and objectives. Total rewards are designed to link the market competitiveness of each employee's compensation with overall Company performance, aligning employees' financial interests with the interests of the Company.
Elements of our compensation package for all non-executive employees consists of base salary or wages, discretionary and non-discretionary short-term incentives to reward the achievement of behavioral goals and business objectives, and for eligible key contributors, long-term equity incentives. 
Changes in the value of each employee's job are monitored annually and adjustments in base pay and short-term incentives are awarded based on a combination of employee performance to pre-determined goals and the Company's overall performance to broader financial and operational goals and objectives. We determine external market competitiveness by gathering salary information from professionally managed third-party salary surveys and by determining pay for individual employees based on their skill level, experience, education, and any other relevant compensatory factors. We use salary market data to create pay structures with pay bands. We assign every job to a pay band by comparing market data to pay band midpoints. We balance internal pay equity with external pay equity to ensure compensation is fairly and equitably dispersed.
Management is committed to the proposition that the total rewards of every employee in pay and benefits are equitably distributed regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, color, veteran status, age, or disability. Furthermore, to ensure the commitment to pay equity is aggressively pursued, we define appropriate metrics from which progress can be tracked. The Human Resources Department prepares periodic reports for senior leadership and the Board of Directors to report progress toward equitable pay, promotions, and opportunities.
We offer all employees the ability to save for retirement by matching dollar for dollar up to six percent of their savings into a qualified savings plan up to certain pre-determined limits set by the IRS. For highly compensated employees who meet the salary threshold set by the IRS and who choose to continue pre-tax savings above the qualified savings plan limits, eligible employees can participate in a non-qualified tax deferred savings plan to save for future needs.
Our intention is to offer every employee fair and equitable cash compensation and competitive non-cash benefits to help employees manage their health and wellness and the health and wellness of their families.
Talent Acquisition & Retention
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources and locations in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We now recruit talent from twenty states across the country, as much of our workforce can work in a mostly remote arrangement. We are establishing relationships with universities, professional associations, and industry groups to proactively attract talent. We look for ways to improve our recruiting process regularly and ensure each applicant feels welcome and comfortable through the recruiting process. Our panel interviews are set up with a diverse group of interviewers to ensure for the best candidate experience. We have taken the ParityPledge in support of women and in support of people of color, demonstrating our commitment to improve the opportunity for advancement of women and people of color into leadership positions.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative and flexible working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and innovative work to attract talent to our company. We empower employees to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions. To ensure the long-term continuity of our business, we actively manage the development of existing talent to fill the roles that are most critical to the on-going success of our Company.
In 2021, we hired 177 new employees, excluding our customer service and warehouse departments, and 55 new customer service and warehouse employees. We have a total average tenure of five years, with an average tenure of three and three quarters years in our customer service and warehouse departments.
Employee Engagement & Wellness
Creating a culture where all employees feel supported and valued is a key part of our corporate mission. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety, and general well-being of our employees as we work through these pandemic-related challenges. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees' health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. We offer comprehensive benefit options to our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples are medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance, auto/home insurance, identity theft insurance and pet insurance, and generous 401(k) matching and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) programs. In addition to these more traditional benefits offerings we also have programs that encourage better work/life balance. These benefits include an onsite medical clinic, fitness center, and child daycare at our largest facility, employee assistance program (EAP) support, and a 9/80 flexible work schedule. We offer paid parental leave for all new parents who have been with the Company for at least a year to ensure they are able to adjust to a new work/life balance. We also offer a caregiver benefit to 
parents who need to travel for work, which allows employees who have a child under the age of two to travel with the employee. We added fertility coverage to our medical plans beginning in January 2022. We also formalized an expanded remote working policy during 2021.
Development & Training
We recognize how important it is for our employees to develop and progress in their careers. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development resources from a competency model development library to hundreds of online courses in our learning management system. We emphasize individual development planning as part of our annual goal setting process, and offer mentoring programs, along with change management and project management upskilling opportunities. We have leadership development resources for all leaders across the organization and continue to build tools for leaders to develop their teams on the job and in roles to create new opportunities to learn and grow. We also encourage higher education and continuing professional education by subsidizing these opportunities for our employees. 
We have an annual training for all employees on the topic of Diversity and Inclusion. This program is designed to strengthen our organization by promoting the inclusion of various viewpoints from the natural talents and abilities of our people regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences.
Company Culture
We attribute the high levels of employee engagement to our corporate culture. The work environment is often described as results-driven, inclusive, generative, and collaborative. Our corporate vision, mission, values, leadership principles, and employee qualities help define who we are, where we are going, and the behavior we expect of the Company and our employees in order to be successful in the organization. 
In order to fulfill our vision of "Dream Homes for All" and the long-term financial goals of the Company, we focus on our mission of customer focus, our leading technology capabilities, and creating enterprise value. Our values articulate our commitment to an inclusive, outcome-driven, and positive work environment, and embody our generative culture and spirit. Our five leadership principles guide the interactions of our leaders with colleagues, creating a psychologically safe environment for productive and collaborative exchanges for improved outcomes. We clearly define, look for, measure, and develop eight qualities in our employees so that we all become empowered to be effective and valuable contributors in the organization. This culture allows us to attract, develop, engage, and retain highly qualified employees for each role in the organization. Our goal is to have every employee feel they are a valued member of a winning team, doing meaningful work, in an environment of trust. The Company regularly reinforces this culture throughout the entire employee experience.
Oversight & Governance
Our focus on human capital management has been a hallmark of the Company for years, understanding that people truly are a Company's most valuable asset, and that culture is an organization's ultimate competitive advantage. Our 401(k) committee meets quarterly to review the plan and determine if any changes need to be made to the portfolio, in order to best serve our employees. Our board of directors dedicates ample time in quarterly meetings with management to discuss trends in hiring, engagement, and attrition. Our Compensation Committee is actively involved in determining competitive compensation strategies to help us continually improve in attracting, developing, and retaining top talent for our Company.
