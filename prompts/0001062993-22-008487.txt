 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Corporate History
 Our predecessor company, Big Flash Corp., was incorporated in Delaware on July 27, 1999. On April 28, 2006, Big Flash, through its Canadian holding corporation, completed the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp., a Canadian company incorporated on June 15, 2003. The Company did not have any operations prior to the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp. In connection with the acquisition, we changed our name from Big Flash Corp. to IntelGenx Technologies Corp. IntelGenx Corp. has continued operations as our operating subsidiary.
Overview 
 We are a drug delivery company established in 2003 and headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Our focus is on the contract development and manufacturing of novel oral thin film products for the pharmaceutical market.  More recently, we have made the strategic decision to enter the Canadian cannabis market with a non-prescription cannabis infused oral film that launched in early 2021 and in 2020 we made the decision to enter the psychedelic market. As a full service contract development and manufacturing organization ("CDMO"), we are offering partners a comprehensive portfolio of pharmaceutical services, including pharmaceutical research and development ("R&D"), clinical monitoring, regulatory support, tech transfer, manufacturing scale-up and commercial manufacturing.
 Our business strategy is to leverage our proprietary drug delivery technologies and develop pharmaceutical products with tangible benefits for patients, for our partners and, once a developed product launches, retain the exclusive manufacturing rights. 
 Managing our project pipeline is a key Company success factor.  We have identified three focus areas; psychedelics, cannabis and animal health where we believe we can establish a leadership position with our drug delivery technology. We have undertaken a strategy under which we will work with pharmaceutical companies in order to apply our oral film technology to pharmaceutical products for which patent protection is nearing expiration, a strategy which is often referred to as "lifecycle management."  Under §505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (the "FDCA"), the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or a combination.
 The 505(b)(2) pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the FDA for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use, the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies.  We have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such so-called "repurposing opportunities" and determine whether our proprietary VersaFilm™ technology adds value to the product.  We currently have two such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline.
 We continue to develop the existing products in our pipeline and may also perform research and development on other potential products as opportunities arise.
 We have established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility with the intent to manufacture all of our VersaFilm™ products in-house as we believe that this:
 
represents a profitable business opportunity;
will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know-how and intellectual property; and
allows us to offer our clients and development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product.

 Our website address is www.intelgenx.com.
 
Technology Platforms 
 Our main product development efforts are based upon four delivery platform technologies: (1) VersaFilm™, an oral film technology, (2) AdVersa®, a mucoadhesive tablet technology, (3) the VetaFilmTM technology platform for veterinary applications, and (4) DisinteQTM a disintegrating oral film technology.
 VersaFilm™ is a drug delivery platform technology that enables the development of oral thin films, improving product performance through:
  
rapid disintegration without the need for water;
quicker buccal or sublingual absorption;
potential for faster onset of action and increased bioavailability;
potential for reduced adverse effects by bypassing first-pass metabolism;
easy administration for patients who have problems swallowing tablets or capsules; pediatric and geriatric patients as well as patients who fear choking and/or are suffering from nausea (e.g., nausea resulting from chemotherapy, radiotherapy or any surgical treatment);
pleasant taste; and
small and thin size, making it convenient for consumers.


Our VersaFilm™ technology consists of a thin (25-35 micron) polymeric film comprised of United States Pharmacopeia components that are approved by the FDA for use in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. Derived from the edible film technology used for breath strips and initially developed for the instant delivery of savory flavors to food substrates, the VersaFilm™ technology is designed to provide a rapid response compared to existing conventional tablets. Our VersaFilm™ technology is intended for indications requiring rapid onset of action, such as migraine, opioid dependence, chronic pain, motion sickness, erectile dysfunction, and nausea.
 Our AdVersa® platform technology allows for the development of oral controlled-release products. It is designed to adhere to the oral mucosa and release the drug to the site of application at a controlled rate. The AdVersa® platform provides the following advantages relative to competing technologies: (i) it avoids the first pass effect, whereby the liver metabolizes the active ingredient and greatly reduces the level of drug reaching the systemic circulation, (ii) it leads to a higher absorption rate in the oral cavity as compared to the conventional oral route, and (iii) it achieves a rapid onset of action for the drug. Our AdVersa® technology is versatile in order to permit the site of application, residence time, and rate of release of the drug to be modulated to achieve the desired results.
 Our VetaFilm™ platform technology is designed for the application in companion animals. Dose acceptance and compliance are often a challenge for the care giver which can be overcome with our newly designed VetaFilm™ platform. VetaFilm™ is specifically formulated with flavors that are appealing to pets and to achieve rapid adhesion to the oral mucosa of the animal to achieve compliance.
 Our new DISINTEQ™ oral disintegrating film formulations will provide different dissolution characteristics compared to VERSAFILM®. Instead of quickly dissolving in the oral cavity, DISINTEQ™ formulations disintegrate at a controlled rate. This will allow a slower release of the drug into the oral cavity thereby avoiding saturation of the oral mucosal membranes and increasing mucosal absorption.
 Our Product Portfolio
 Our product portfolio includes a blend of generic and branded products based on our proprietary delivery technology ("generic" products are essentially copies of products that have already received FDA approval).  Of the thirteen projects currently in our product portfolio, twelve use our VersaFilm™ technology and one uses our VetaFilmTM technology.
 Our most advanced projects:
 INT0008/2008: We developed a Rizatriptan oral film product based on our VersaFilm™ technology. In March 2013 we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application ("NDA") to the FDA for our novel oral thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan, which demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the active drug in Maxalt-MLT® orally disintegrating tablets.  Maxalt-MLT® is a leading branded anti-migraine product marketed by Merck & Co.  The thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan was originally developed under a co-development and commercialization agreement with RedHill Biopharma Ltd. ("RedHill") which was terminated December 5, 2017, following which Redhill transferred all rights and obligations to us.
 
On July 5, 2016, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Grupo Juste S.A.Q.F. (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L. ("Exeltis")) for the commercialization of RIZAPORT® for the treatment of acute migraines in Spain.  Exeltis is a prominent private Spanish company with over 90 years of experience in the research, development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceutical products, including migraine and other central nervous system drugs, in Europe, Latin America and other territories.
 Under the definitive agreement, Exeltis obtained exclusive rights to register, promote and distribute RIZAPORT® in Spain.  In exchange, we and Redhill received upfront payments and are entitled to milestone payments, together with a share of the net sales of RIZAPORT® in Spain.  The initial term of this agreement is ten years from the date of first commercial sale of the product and shall automatically renew for one additional two-year term. On August 27, 2020, we announced that we had granted Exeltis an exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize RIZAPORT® in the European Union ("EU").  Exeltis will pay us prespecified royalties on net RIZAPORT® sales in the EU.  In addition, we have a right of first refusal to manufacture this product for the EU market. Effective September 9, 2020, we signed a technology transfer agreement with LTS Lohmann Therapy Systems for future manufacture and supply of the product for Spain.
 On October 31, 2018, we received National marketing authorization from the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices for RIZAPORT® (10mg) in Spain. 
 On September 7, 2021, we announced that Exeltis Healthcare S.L. ("Exeltis"), our commercialization partner in the European Union ("EU") for RIZAPORT®, a unique for the treatment of acute migraines, has launched the product in Spain.
 On December 12, 2018, we announced the execution of a definitive licensing, development and supply agreement with Gensco® Pharma, a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on research, development and marketing of prescription products, for the exclusive right to commercialize RIZAPORT® in the United States.  In return, we are entitled to receive royalty payments based on the net profits of RIZAPORT®.  We are also eligible to receive milestone payments upon FDA approval and product launch.  This agreement also grants Gensco® Pharma a right of first refusal for the exclusive rights to develop, market, sell, distribute and fully commercialize products as a partner for the People's Republic of China. 
 On January 30, 2019, we announced that the FDA had performed a Pre-Approval Inspection ("PAI") of our manufacturing facility in Montreal, relating to our NDA for RIZAPORT®.  At the conclusion of the PAI on January 25, the FDA issued a Form 483 with five inspectional observations that needed attention before final approval. 
 On March 27, 2020, we received an additional CRL from the FDA.  The Agency requested additional information, but no new bioequivalence study.  We have addressed the issues raised in the CLR and are currently preparing the CLR response
 On December 14, 2016, we announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with Pharmatronic Co. for the commercialization of RIZAPORT® in the Republic of Korea ("South Korea").  Under the terms of such agreement, we granted Pharmatronic Co. the exclusive rights to register and commercialize RIZAPORT® in South Korea.  IntelGenx have received an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive additional milestone payments upon achievement of certain predefined regulatory and commercial targets, as well as tiered royalties.  The initial term of the definitive agreement with Pharmatronic Co. is for ten years from the date of first commercial sale and shall automatically renew for an additional two-year term.
 INT0046/2018: Our first cannabis project based on our VersaFilm™ technology contains 10mg CBD/CBDA.
 On November 7, 2018 we announced the execution of a definitive license, development and supply agreement with Tilray, Inc. ("Tilray"), a global leader in cannabis production and distribution.  Under such agreement, the two companies will co-develop and commercialize oral film products infused with adult-used medical cannabis ("cannabis infused VersaFilm™").
 Under the agreement with Tilray, we and Tilray will fund 20% and 80%, respectively, of the costs associated with the development of the cannabis infused Versafilm™ products.  We will have the exclusive right to manufacture and supply the co-developed products to Tilray, and will also receive a fixed single-digit royalty on net product sales.  Tilray will have the exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the co-developed products.
 In connection with the Tilray agreement, we and Tilray also executed a subscription agreement under which Tilray made a strategic investment in IntelGenx through a non-brokered private placement (the "Tilray Private Placement").  As a result, we issued Tilray 1,428,571 shares of Common Stock at a subscription price of $0.70 per share of Common Stock for gross proceeds of $1,000,000.  We used the proceeds of the Tilray Private Placement for cannabis infused VersaFilm™ product development under the agreement with Tilray.
 
On May 2019, we received the first extract from Tilray in sufficient quantities to commence batch production of cannabis-infused VersaFilm® followed by an announcement in October that the formulation had progressed to the scale-up manufacturing stage.  The manufacturing scale-up work was completed successfully in January 2020.
 In the spring of 2019, we applied for a micro-processing license under the Canadian Cannabis Act (the "Cannabis Act"), which would  allow us to process 600kg of cannabis per year, perform analytical testing and begin sales and research on cannabis.  On June 5, 2020, we received the cannabis micro-processing license from Health Canada for our Montreal, Quebec facility, in accordance with the Cannabis Act and the regulations thereunder.
 On July 20, 2020, we announced that the exclusivity terms of the November 2018 license, development and supply agreement with Tilray had been amended to allow for the Company's co-development and commercialization of cannabidiol ("CBD") products with additional partners.  In consideration, we shall pay a royalty to Tilray on all CBD products sold under this amendment.  All other terms of such agreement, including those pertaining to Tilray's exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for non-CBD cannabis infused VersaFilm®, remained unchanged.
 On October 29, 2020, we signed a letter of intent with Heritage Cannabis Holding Corp. ("Heritage Cannabis") for long term cannabis filmstrip supply agreement. Shortly after on January 7, 2021, we announced the execution of a definitive supply agreement with Heritage Cannabis for the manufacturing and supply of filmstrip products containing 10 mg of CBD/CBDA using our VersaFilm® technology for the Canadian and Australian markets.
 On March 31, 2021, we announced that we completed our first shipment, consisting of 75,000 CBD/CBDA Filmstrips, to Heritage Cannabis Holdings Corp. to support the launch in Australia.
 On August 31, 2021, we announced that we completed an additional shipment of CBD/CBDA Filmstrips in support of Heritage Cannabis Holdings Corp.'s Canadian market launch of its "CB4 Control" branded product.
 On December 8, 2021, we announced that we initiated an arbitration proceeding against Tilray, related to an alleged breach of the parties' 2018 license, development and supply agreement, as amended with Tilray® for the co-development and commercialization of cannabis-infused VersaFilm® products.
 INT0007/2006: We are developing an oral film product based on our VersaFilm™ technology containing the active ingredient tadalafil.  This product is intended for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ("ED").  The results of a phase I pilot study conducted in the second quarter of 2015 confirmed that the product is bioequivalent with the brand product, Cialis®.
 On May 8, 2019, we executed a worldwide collaboration agreement for tadalafil with Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. ("Aquestive").  Under the terms of this agreement, we and Aquestive will each grant to the other exclusive worldwide licenses to their respective intellectual property relating to tadalafil oral film formulation and manufacturing.  The companies will jointly undertake further co-development and commercialization of tadalafil oral film products, and will equally share (50/50) net profits from worldwide product sales.  Aquestive previously submitted an NDA for its tadalafil oral film for the treatment of ED to the FDA.  In November 2018, Aquestive received a CRL from the FDA requesting additional safety data from healthy volunteers.  Both companies are currently working on responding to the CRL.
 On September 29, 2021, we announced that Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc., our co-development and commercialization partner for Tadalafil oral films for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, has entered into a definitive license and supply agreement with an undisclosed leading men's health company for the US.
 INT0039/2013: This product is based on one of our proprietary technologies and was being developed under another development and commercialization agreement with Par Pharmaceuticals ("Par").  On September 18, 2015, Endo International plc ("Endo") acquired Par. As a result of this acquisition, Par had a conflict and was unable to remain as the partner for this product.  Therefore, the product was returned to us with full rights and no requirement for any compensation for work paid by Par.
 
On September 12, 2016, we entered into a licensing, development and supply agreement with Chemo Group ("Chemo") granting Chemo the exclusive license to commercialize two generic products for the United States market and one product on a worldwide basis.  Under the terms of this agreement, Chemo obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell our products in exchange for upfront and milestone payments, together with a share of the profits of commercialization.  Chemo also has a right of first negotiation to obtain the exclusive commercialization rights for two of the products to include any country outside the United States.
 On October 4, 2018, we submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") to the FDA for a generic buccal film product for our partner, Insud Pharma (formerly Chemo Group).  On January 30, 2019, the FDA confirmed the acceptance for review of this ANDA with a GDUFA date of October 18, 2019. 
 On June 2019, the FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection for the buccal film that resulted in the FDA issuing us a Form 483, a report from an investigator noting conditions that in their judgment may constitute violations of the FDCA and related acts.  Further, in October 2019, we received a CRL in which the FDA declined to approve our product.  A CRL does not necessarily indicate that a drug or biologic is not safe or effective.  Rather, the FDA issues a CRL when it has reviewed the submitted data and has outstanding questions.  A CRL allows the FDA to provide an applicant with a systematic list of deficiencies detected within the submission package sent to the agency that stop short of requiring an entire resubmission. Our updated response to the 483 was submitted on April 28 2021 and our response to the CRL was sent to the FDA on May 14, 2021.On February 2022 the FDA conducted a second pre-approval inspection based on the initial response to the CRL filed earlier in May 2021 which resulted in the issuance of a Form 483 with two observations. Subsequently, on March 14, 2022 the FDA issued a second CRL requesting more information on the product and changes to the labelling.
 INT0043/2015: We developed an oral film containing montelukast as the active ingredient based on our proprietary VersaFilm™ oral film technology, which is in the early clinical trial phase.
 We are collaborating with Dr. Ludwig Aigner, a member of our Scientific Advisory Board and head of the Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine at the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria.  Dr. Aigner has made major contributions in the field of brain and spinal cord regeneration over the last 25 years.  He was the first to develop tools to visualize neurogenesis in living animals and identified crucial signaling mechanisms that are involved in limiting brain regeneration.  One of these mechanisms, leukotriene signaling, is related to asthma.  In consequence, Dr. Aigner and his team recently demonstrated that the anti-asthmatic drug montelukast structurally and functionally rejuvenates the aged brain.  His main aim is to develop molecular and cellular therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and for the aged population.
 On July 13, 2016, we announced the successful completion of a pilot clinical study for our montelukast VersaFilm™ that demonstrated a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to the reference product.  The study data confirmed that buccal absorption of the drug from the montelukast film product resulted in a significantly improved bioavailability of the drug compared to the commercial tablet.  In addition, the study data confirmed that montelukast crosses the blood brain barrier when administered using our Versafilm™ delivery technology.
 On 2017 we announced receiving a no objection letter from Health Canada regarding a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study.  The objectives of this 26-week, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase IIa proof of concept study to be conducted at eight clinical study sites across Canada will be to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of montelukast buccal film in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease ("AD").  The trial design includes testing of up to 70 patients.
 Based on the outcome of this first efficacy trial in humans, we will be actively seeking a partnership or alliance opportunity to further advance developmental work and commercialization of this product.
 On September 25, 2018, we announced the beginning of patient recruitment for the proposed AD study.  In October 2019, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ("DSMB") completed its first interim analysis of the ongoing montelukast AD Phase IIa ("BUENA") clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate AD.  The DSMB reviewed compiled safety data from 25 subjects enrolled in the BUENA trial, 13 of whom have completed 26 weeks of daily treatment.  The DSMB did not raise any concerns regarding safety and recommended that the trial continue.
 Based on additional efficacy testing of montelukast in an AD mouse model, conducted in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Ludwig Aigner's group at the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg suggesting that montelukast, when given at higher doses, significantly improves cognition in patients suffering from memory impairment and dementia, a revision of the dosage regiment was requested to Health Canada through the filing of a clinical trial application.  Health Canada issued a non-objection letter in January 2020. 
 
On October 12, 2021, we announced our intention to resume patient screening in the ongoing Montelukast VersaFilm® Phase 2a ("BUENA") clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease following Health Canada's issuance of a No Objection Letter in response to IntelGenx's amended Clinical Trial Application.
 Subsequent to year end, on January 20, 2022, we announced that patient dosing has resumed in the ongoing Phase 2a ("BUENA") clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease ("AD") under a previously amended protocol using higher doses of Montelukast VersaFilm®.
 Our Psychedelic Programs:
 INT0052/2020.  On July 7, 2020 we entered into a feasibility agreement with Cybin Corp. for a fast-acting, orally-dissolving psilocybin film.  We are currently developing a formulation intended for a clinical phase 1 study.
 INT0053/2020.  On August 20, 2020 we entered into a feasibility agreement with atai to develop pharmaceutical-grade polymeric film-based psychedelics. Some material was received and we are currently developing a formulation. However, in parallel, both companies are currently working on the required import and export licenses to continue the R&D work.
 INT0054/2020.  On May 12, 2021, we entered into a second feasibility agreement with  atai for the development of novel formulations of Salvinorin A, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound being developed for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and other indications.
Our Animal Health Programs:
 INT0048/2020  VetaFilm: On January 9, 2020 we entered the animal health market by signing a feasibility agreement for its VetaFilm™ platform.  We have performed all of our obligations under such agreement and the successfully developed high loading VetaFilm which was sent for evaluation by our partner.  Based on the successful feasibility study, we are advancing the product development with the partner.
 On February 8, 2021, we announced that we have filed a new provisional patent application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") entitled "High Loading Oral Film Formulation". The patent application covers the incorporation of high concentrations of active ingredients in products based on IntelGenx's VetaFilm™ proprietary veterinary oral film technology. This higher loading capability enables a formulation with a ratio of active-to-polymer of 1-to-1, thereby pushing the limit of the film capabilities and distinguishing it from known oral film technology.
 Other Programs:
 INT0027/2011: We developed this oral film product based on our VersaFilm™ technology under a co-development and commercialization agreement with Par (now an operating company of Endo).  The product is a generic formulation of a commercial buprenorphine and naloxone-containing sublingual film for the treatment of opioid dependence.  With Par, we developed a bioequivalent film formulation, scaled-up to a commercial manufacturing process and manufactured and tested pivotal batches during a subsequent pivotal clinical study.  Par filed an ANDA with the FDA in July 2013.
 On August 2013, we were notified that, in response to the filing of the ANDA, we were named as a co-defendant in a lawsuit under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act filed by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals ("Reckitt") and Monosol RX ("Monosol") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware Court") alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 8,475,832, 8,603,514 and 8,017,150, each of which relate to Suboxone®.  We believe the ANDA product does not infringe those or any other patents.  Under the terms of the co-development and commercialization agreement, Par was financially responsible for the costs of the defense.  In June 2016, the Delaware Court ruled that our product is not infringing on two out of the three patents.  Subsequently, both parties filed appeals.
 On December 2014, Reckitt and Monosol filed another lawsuit for patent infringement in the Delaware Court relating to the Suboxone® ANDA product.  We were named as a co-defendant in this action alleging patent infringement of United States Patent Nos. 8,900,497 ("the '497 patent") and 8,906,277 ("the '277 patent"), each of which related to a process for making a uniform oral film (the "process patents").  The trial on the process patents was held in November 2016.
 
On May 14, 2018,  we, Par, Indivior, Inc., Indivior UK Limited, and Aquestive (previously Monosol RX) settled all patent litigation related to Suboxone® film.  The settlement agreement permits Par to begin selling a generic version of Suboxone® film on January 1, 2023 or earlier under certain circumstances.
 INT0040/2014: This oral film product is based on our proprietary VersaFilm™ technology.  On December 27, 2016, we entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement with Endo for this product in the United States market.  Under such agreement, Endo obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell our product in the United States.  We received an upfront payment and will receive future milestone payments. Endo will share with us the expected profits of commercialization. The project is currently on hold due to low sales of the brand product.
 INT0036/2013: This oral film product is based on our proprietary oral film technology VersaFilm™. Loxapine is indicated for the treatment of anxiety and aggression in patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder.  Using our VersaFilm™ technology allows an improved product to offer patients significant therapeutic benefits compared to existing medications.  We expect to effectively treat acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder in non-institutionalized patients while reducing the risk of pulmonary problems.  Our product is needed, as it could substantially reduce the potential risks of violence and injury to patients and others by preventing or reducing the duration and severity of an episode of acute agitation.  Our first clinical study on this product, completed in Q4 2014, suggested improved bioavailability compared to the currently approved tablet.  In late 2015, we completed a second pilot clinical study which demonstrated that buccal absorption of the drug from the Loxapine oral film results in a significantly higher bioavailability of the drug compared to oral tablets.  We were working to optimize the film to further improve the time to reach peak plasma concentrations, however, due to the prioritization of our project line, we directed resources to other projects, leading to a temporary hold of the optimization work during 2019. This project is currently on hold.
 INT0010/2006: This product is based on our proprietary AdVersa® technology and has been transferred to Tetra BioPharma. We initially entered into an agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (formerly Cannasat Therapeutics Inc., "Cynapsus") for the development of a buccal muco-adhesive tablet product containing a cannabinoid-based drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain and nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  In 2009, we completed a clinical biostudy on this product.  The study results indicated improved bioavailability and reduced first-pass metabolization of the drug.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired full control of, and interest in, this project from Cynapsus going forward.  We also obtained worldwide rights to United States Patent 7,592,328 and all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications to exclusively develop and further secure intellectual property protection for this project.
 On October 21, 2020, we entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement with Tetra Bio-Pharma under which Tetra is purchasing the worldwide Adversa® technology rights as it relates to its PPP-002 (Dronabinol) drug product candidate for three undisclosed milestone payments: 45% to be paid on November 15, 2020; 45% to be paid on March 1, 2021, and a final payment of 10% upon successful technology transfer. In addition, Tetra will pay us a royalty on future net sales of Dronabinol mucoadhesive tablets.

Growth Strategy 
 Our primary growth strategy is based on providing CDMO services to the pharmaceutical industry by focusing on three key strategic areas: (1) psychedelics, (2) cannabis, and (3) animal health.
 We have established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the future manufacture of our VersaFilm™ and VetaFilm™ products. We believe that this (1) represents a profitable business opportunity, (2) will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know-how and intellectual property, and (3) allows us to offer our development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product.
 With our current manufacturing equipment, we are only able to manufacture products that do not contain flammable organic solvents.  We initiated a project to expand the existing manufacturing facility, the timing of which will be dictated in part by the completion of agreements with our commercial partners.  This expansion became necessary following requests by commercial partners to increase manufacturing capacity and provide solvent film manufacturing capabilities.  The new facility should create a fivefold increase of our production capacity in addition to offering a one-stop shopping opportunity to our partners and provide better protection of our Intellectual Property.
 Product Opportunities that provide Tangible Patient Benefits
 In addition to our three key strategic areas we will offer our services to develop oral film products leveraging our VersaFilm™ technology that provide tangible patient benefits versus existing drug delivery forms. Patients with difficulties swallowing medication, pediatrics or geriatrics may benefit from oral films due to the ease of use. Similarly, we are working on oral films to improve bio-availability and/or response time versus existing drugs and thereby reducing side effects.
Development of New Drug Delivery Technologies 
 The rapidly disintegrating film technology contained in our VersaFilm™, and our AdVersa® mucosal adhesive tablet, are two examples of our efforts to develop alternate technology platforms.  As we work with various partners on different products, we seek opportunities to develop new proprietary technologies.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to the rapid emergence of new technologies, governmental regulations, healthcare legislation, availability of financing, patent litigation and other factors. Many of our competitors, including Aquestive Therapeutics Inc. (formerly Monosol Rx), Tesa-Labtec GmbH, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and LTS Lohmann Therapy Systems Corp., have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, legal and other resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting clinical trials of pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and marketing and selling products that have been approved. We expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete.
 The key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include, among other factors:
 
the regulatory requirements;


the safety and efficacy of our products;


the relative speed with which we can develop products;


generic competition for any product that we develop;


our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our intellectual property and technology base;


our ability to differentiate our products;


our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost effective basis;


our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") and any other regulatory requirements; and


our ability to obtain financing.

 In order to establish ourselves as a viable full service CDMO partner, we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities, analytical testing and in our manufacturing technology expertise, in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture products based on our drug delivery technologies at competitive costs.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our key competitive strengths include:
 
our comprehensive service portfolio;


our ability to swiftly develop products through to regulatory approval;


the versatility of our drug delivery technologies, and


our highly qualified, dedicated professional team.

Dependence on Major Customers
 We currently rely on a few major customers for our end products. We also currently depend upon a limited number of partners to develop our products, to provide funding for the development of our products, to assist in obtaining regulatory approvals that are required in order to commercialize these products, and to market and sell our products.
Intellectual Property and Patent Protection 
 We protect our intellectual property and technology by using the following methods: (i) applying for patent protection in the United States and in the appropriate foreign markets, (ii) non-disclosure agreements, license agreements and appropriate contractual restrictions and controls on the distribution of information, and (iii) trade secrets, common law trademark rights and trademark registrations.  We plan to file core technology patents covering the use of our platform technologies in any pharmaceutical products.
 We have obtained 37 patents and have 39 published pending patent applications, as described below.  The patents expire 20 years after submission of the initial application.  In the United States, the term of a patent sometimes extends over the 20-year period.  The initial term of 20 years is extended by a period (the "patent term adjustment") determined by the USPTO according to delays in the prosecution of the patent application that are not applicant delays.
 Our patent portfolio is dynamic in nature and constantly under review to assess the business priorities, as such any of the currently pending application and issued patent may be abandoned if the expense of pursuing prosecution or maintaining the patent or application active is no longer warranted by our business targets.

 COVID-19 
 Our operations and financial condition have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though we were granted an exemption by local authorities which permitted us to continue operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we nevertheless faced multiple operational and financial challenges. Despite these challenges, we have continually been able to minimize the impact on our overall performance. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we partially reorganized our operations, adopted a remote work policy for employees and management and implemented a compensation deferral program. We also benefited from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy as well as the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program from our landlord. There is uncertainty as to the duration of these benefits and hence the potential impact.
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been, and remain, in compliance with all federal, provincial, and municipal regulations that have been put in place since the beginning of the pandemic. We will continue to monitor any further developments in this regard, with the health and safety of our employees and management as the primary concern.
 Government Regulation
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. The products we participate in developing require certain regulatory approvals. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA.  The FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, packaging, labeling, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and/or the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals or to market drugs.  The steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include:

preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under FDA's good laboratory practices regulations, ("GLPs");
the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
the completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to good clinical practice regulations,("GCPs"), to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication for which approval is sought;
after successful completion of the required clinical testing, submission to the FDA of an NDA, or an ANDA, for generic drugs. In certain cases, an application for marketing approval may include information regarding safety and efficacy of a proposed drug that comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. Such applications, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, are permitted for new drug products that incorporate previously approved active ingredients, even if the proposed new drug incorporates an approved active ingredient in a novel formulation or for a new indication;
satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is to be produced, to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; and
FDA review and approval of the NDA or ANDA.

 
The cost of complying with the foregoing requirements, including preparing and submitting an NDA or ANDA, may be substantial.  Accordingly, we typically rely upon our partners in the pharmaceutical industry to spearhead and bear the costs of the FDA approval process.  We also seek to mitigate regulatory costs by focusing on 505(b)(2) NDA opportunities. By applying our drug delivery technology to existing drugs, we seek to develop products with lower research & development ("R&D") expenses and shorter time-to-market timelines as compared to regular NDA products.
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
 The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board,("IRB"), covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.
 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription drug product, which beginning in Fiscal Year 2018 replaced the product and establishment fees.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months.
 
The FDA may refer applications for proprietary drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities and possibly conducts a sponsor inspection, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The review by the FDA is two months for a Class I resubmission and six months for a Class 2 resubmission.  An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess whether the REMS plan is effective. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.
 Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Ongoing adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs and NDA specifications after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and training and compliance efforts in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws. Regulatory authorities may require remediation, withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems or new concerns are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution may be pursued.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 ANDA Approval Process
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 505(b)(2) NDAs
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the reference drug NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 
Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent related exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot review, or in some cases, approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a company may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity ("NCE"), which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
 A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation of a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In the EU, we may seek marketing authorization under either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency, ("EMA"), implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
 
Other Regulation
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations, in each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Canadian Medical and Adult-Use
 Medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada is regulated under the federal Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations ("CR") promulgated under the Cannabis Act. Both the Cannabis Act and CR came into force in October 2018, superseding earlier legislation that only permitted commercial distribution and home cultivation of medical cannabis. The following are the highlights of the current federal legislation:
 
a federal license is required for companies to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical or non-medical purposes;
Health Canada, federal government entity, is the oversight and regulatory body for cannabis licenses in Canada. As of December 31, 2020, Health Canada has issued approximately 570 active licenses to licensees under the CR ("Licensed Producers");
allows individuals to purchase, possess and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for medical purposes and, for individuals over the age of 18 years, for adult-use recreational purposes;
enables the provinces and territories to regulate other aspects associated with recreational adult-use. In particular, each province or territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products, and those laws may set lower maximum permitted quantities for individuals and higher age requirements;
promotion, packaging and labelling of cannabis is strictly regulated. For example, promotion is largely restricted to the place of sale and age-gated environments (i.e., environments with verification measures in place to restrict access to persons of legal age). Promotions that appeal to underage individuals are prohibited;
since the current federal regime came into force on October 17, 2018, certain classes of cannabis, including dried cannabis and oils, have been permitted for sale into the medical and adult-use markets;
following amendments to the CR that came into force on October 17, 2019 (often referred to as Cannabis 2.0 regulations);
other non-combustible form-factors, including edibles, topicals, and extracts (both ingested and inhaled), are permitted in the medical and adult-use markets;
export is restricted to medical cannabis, cannabis for scientific purposes, and industrial hemp; and
sale of medical cannabis occurs on a direct-to-patient basis from a federally licensed provider, while sale of adult-use cannabis occurs through retail-distribution models established by provincial and territorial governments.

 All provincial and territorial governments have, to varying degrees, enacted regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of recreational adult-use cannabis within their jurisdiction, including minimum age requirements. The retail-distribution models for adult-use cannabis varies nationwide:
 
Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have adopted a government-run model for retail and distribution;
Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador have adopted a hybrid model with some aspects, including distribution and online retail being government-run while allowing for private licensed retail stores;
Manitoba and Saskatchewan have adopted a private model, with privately-run retail stores and online sales, with distribution in Manitoba managed by the provincial government; and
the three northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut have adopted a model that mirrors their government-run liquor distribution model.

 
All provinces and territories have secured supply agreements from Licensed Producers for their respective markets. We are fulfilling adult-use supply agreements and purchase orders from various jurisdictions, consisting of: Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, and the Yukon.
 United States Regulation of Hemp
 Hemp products are subject to state and federal regulation in respect to the production, distribution and sale of products intended for human ingestion or topical application. Hemp is categorized as Cannabis sativa L., a subspecies of the cannabis genus. Numerous unique, chemical compounds are extractable from Hemp, including tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") and CBD. These cannabinoids are responsible for a range of potential psychological and physiological effects. Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, is distinguishable from marijuana, which also comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies, by its absence of more than trace amounts (0.3% or less) of the psychoactive compound THC. Although international standards vary, other countries, such as Canada, use the same THC potency standards to define Hemp.
 The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA, under the FD&C Act, to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including products that contain Hemp extracts and derivatives, such as CBD. As a result, the FD&C Act will continue to apply to Hemp-derived food, drugs, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and devices introduced, or prepared for introduction, into interstate commerce. As a producer and marketer of Hemp-derived products, the Company must comply with the FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing and marketing of certain products, including food, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.
 As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law dictates that CBD derived from Hemp is not a controlled substance; however, CBD derived from Hemp may still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. Individual states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of Hemp-derived CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial Hemp activities, other states, however, maintain drug laws that do not distinguish between marijuana and Hemp and/or Hemp-derived CBD which results in Hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws.
 European Union Medical Use
 While each country in the EU has its own laws and regulations, many common practices are being adopted relative to the developing and growing medical cannabis market. For example, to ensure quality and safe products for patients, many EU countries only permit the import and sale of medical cannabis from GMP-certified manufacturers.
 The EU requires adherence to GMP standards for the manufacture of active substances and medicinal products, including cannabis products. The EU system for certification of GMP allows a Competent Authority of any EU member state to conduct inspections of manufacturing sites and, if the strict GMP standards are met, to issue a certificate of GMP compliance that is also accepted in other EU member countries.
 Competitive Conditions
 As of December 31, 2020, Health Canada has issued approximately 570 active licenses to cannabis cultivators, processors and sellers. Health Canada licenses are limited to individual properties. As such, if a Licensed Producer seeks to commence production at a new site, it must apply to Health Canada for a new license. As demand for legal cannabis increases and the number of authorized retail distribution points increases, we believe new competitors are likely to enter the Canadian cannabis market.
 We also expect more countries to pass regulation allowing for the use of medical and/or recreational cannabis. While expansion of the global cannabis market will provide more opportunities to grow our international business, we also expect to experience increased global competition.
 
Psychedelic Regulatory Disclosure
 Canada
 In Canada, oversight of healthcare is divided between the federal and provincial governments. The federal government is responsible for regulating, among other things, the approval, import, sale, and marketing of controlled substances, whether natural or novel. The provincial/territorial level of government has authority over the delivery of health care services, including regulating health facilities, administering health insurance plans such as the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, distributing prescription drugs within the province, and regulating health professionals such as doctors, psychologists, psychotherapists and nurse practitioners. Regulation is generally overseen by various colleges formed for that purpose, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.
 Certain psychoactive compounds, such as psilocybin, are considered controlled substances under Schedule III of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (the "CDSA"). The production, possession, sale and distribution of controlled substances is prohibited unless specifically permitted by the government. Notwithstanding the prohibitions on various activities with respect to controlled substances that are set out in the CDSA, there are several avenues through which one can be legally permitted to conduct otherwise-prohibited activities with controlled substances.
 For instance, in order to conduct certain kinds of scientific research, including pre-clinical and clinical trials, using controlled substances (including various psychoactive compounds), an exemption granted by the Minister of Health under Section 56 of the CDSA (a "Section 56 Exemption") is required. This exemption allows the person to whom the Section 56 Exemption was issued to perform the activities specified in the Section 56 Exemption in relation to the controlled substance(s) specified in the Section 56 Exemption without being subject to the corresponding restrictions set out in the CDSA. Section 56 Exemptions may be granted by the Minister of Health to individual persons or to particular classes of persons, but only for medical purposes, scientific purposes, or where it is in the public interest.
 Additionally, dealer's licences may be applied for and obtained pursuant to various regulations existing under the CDSA. Dealer's licences can authorize the holders thereof (also known as licensed dealers) to possess, produce, assemble, sell, provide, transport, send, deliver, import and/or export one or more controlled substances. Licensed dealers are permitted to engage in all activities that are expressly set out in their respective licences. With respect to psychedelic substances, the primary regulations pursuant to which a person may obtain the appropriate dealer's licence are Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations (Canada)-which applies to "restricted drugs" such as psilocin and psilocybin-and the Narcotic Control Regulations (Canada)-which applies to "narcotics" such as ketamine. In order to receive a dealer's licence, a party must meet all regulatory requirements mandated by the applicable regulations, including (without limitation) having sufficiently secure facilities and other physical infrastructure, and all requisite personnel (e.g., a senior person in charge; a qualified person in charge) that possess the necessary qualifications set out under the applicable regulations.
 The Company currently holds a dealer's licence, as issued pursuant to the CDSA, which authorizes the Company to possess, sell, supply, send, transport and deliver various controlled substances, including, among others, 2,2'-bisnaloxone, fentanyl, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, oxycodone, pseudobuprenorphine, psilocin, psilocybin and thebaine. The Company may, from the time to time, apply for approval to perform additional activities under its dealer's licence and/or to perform such activities in relation to additional controlled substances.
 United States
 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of any prescription drug product candidates or commercial products. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market. The Company's commercial partners will be responsible for filing the necessary regulatory applications such as Investigational New Drug ("IND") with the FDA following the development by the Company of a prototype containing the psychedelic compound.
 Psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin, are strictly controlled under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §801, et. seq. (the "CSA") as Schedule I substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. Anyone wishing to conduct research on substances listed in Schedule I under the CSA must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), and obtain DEA approval of the research proposal.
 
Please see "Research and Development - Psychedelics" for additional information concerning the regulation applicable to the process required before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States.
 The FDA also regulates the formulation, manufacturing, preparation, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of foods, drugs and dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FFDCA") and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA"). "Dietary supplements" are defined as vitamins, minerals, herbs, other botanicals, amino acids and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet, as well as concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts or combinations of such dietary ingredients. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were on the market prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. New dietary ingredients (i.e., not marketed in the U.S. prior to October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been "present in the food supply as an article used for food" without being "chemically altered." A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a "history of use or other evidence of safety" establishing that use of the dietary ingredient, when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement, "will reasonably be expected to be safe." A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredients that the Company may want to market, and the FDA's refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients.
 The DSHEA revised the provisions of the FFDCA concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplement ingredients and products. Under the DSHEA, dietary supplement labeling must include the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), the nutrition labeling, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. The DSHEA also states that dietary supplements may display "statements of nutritional support," provided certain requirements are met. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of first use in marketing and must be accompanied by a label disclosure that "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease." Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function or well-being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. Any statement of nutritional support the Company makes in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA were to determine that a particular statement of nutritional support was an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim about disease risk reduction for a food product, or if the FDA were to determine that a particular claim was not adequately supported by existing scientific data or was false or misleading, the Company would be prevented from using that claim. In addition, the FDA deems promotional and internet materials as labeling; therefore, the Company's promotional and internet materials must comply with FDA requirements and could be the subject of regulatory action by the FDA, or by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") if that agency or other governmental authorities, reviewing the materials as advertising, considers the materials false and misleading.
 U.S. laws also require recordkeeping and reporting to the FDA of all serious adverse events involving dietary supplements products. The Company will need to comply with such recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and implement procedures governing adverse event identification, investigation and reporting. As a result of reported adverse events, health and safety risks or violations of applicable laws and regulations, the Company may from time to time elect, or be required, to recall, withdraw or remove a product from a market, either temporarily or permanently.
 The Company's expected nutraceutical products may be considered "food" and must be labeled as such. Within the U.S., this category of products is subject to the federal Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act ("NLEA"), and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients in conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts for the purposes to which they are put in foods, or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations. If the Company's expected nutraceutical products were regulated as foods, it would be required to comply with the Federal Food Safety & Modernization Act and applicable regulations. The Company would be required to provide foreign supplier certifications evidencing the Company's compliance with FDA requirements.
 The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FFDCA applicable to foods, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal or harmful products, to request a recall of products from the market, and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U. S. courts. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties, including under administrative, civil and criminal laws for violating U.S. laws and regulations, and the Company's expected nutraceutical products could be banned or subject to recall from the marketplace. The Company could also be subject to possible business and consumer claims under applicable statutory, product liability and common laws.
 
The FTC will exercise jurisdiction over the advertising of the Company's expected nutraceutical products in the United States. The FTC has in the past instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of dietary supplement products, including for false and misleading advertising, label claims or product promotional claims. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, which the Company may utilize, as well as the role of endorsements and product clinical studies. The Company cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question the Company's advertising, product claims, promotional materials or other operations in the future. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations, including the ability to institute enforcement actions that could result in recall actions, consent decrees, injunctions, and civil and criminal penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the FTC's laws and regulations could impair the Company's ability to market the Company's expected nutraceutical products.
 The Company will also be subject to regulation under various state and local laws, ordinances and regulations that include provisions governing, among other things, the registration, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, sale and distribution of foods and dietary supplements. In addition, in the future, the Company may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or by other federal, state, local or foreign governmental authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that the Company considers favorable, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. In the future, the Company believes that the dietary supplement industry will likely face increased scrutiny from federal, state and local governmental authorities. It is difficult to predict the effect future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations will have on the Company's business. However, such changes could require the reformulation of products, recalls or discontinuance of products, additional administrative requirements, revised or additional labeling, increased scientific substantiation or other requirements. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or financial performance.

 Prescription Drugs in Canada
 If and as permitted by applicable law, the Company intends to manufacture prescription drugs with which it is authorized to deal pursuant to its dealer's licence. The process required before a prescription drug product candidate may be marketed in Canada generally involves:
 Chemical and Biological Research - Laboratory tests are carried out on tissue cultures and with a variety of small animals to determine the effects of the drug. If the results are promising, the manufacturer will proceed to the next step of development.
 Pre-Clinical Development - Animals are given the drug in varying amounts over differing periods of time. If it can be shown that the drug causes no serious or unexpected harm at the doses required to have an effect, the manufacturer will proceed to clinical trials.
 Clinical Trials - Phase I - The first administration in humans is to test if people can tolerate the drug. If this testing is to take place in Canada, the manufacturer must prepare a clinical trial application for the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada (the "TPD"). This includes the results of the first two steps and a proposal for testing in humans. If the information is sufficient, the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada (the "HPFB") grants permission to start testing the drug, generally first on healthy volunteers.
 Clinical Trials - Phase II - Phase II trials are carried out on people with the target condition, who are usually otherwise healthy, with no other medical condition. Trials carried out in Canada must be approved by the TPD. In phase II, the objective of the trials is to continue to gather information on the safety of the drug and begin to determine its effectiveness.
 Clinical Trials - Phase III - If the results from phase II show promise, the manufacturer provides an updated clinical trial application to the TPD for phase III trials. The objectives of phase III include determining whether the drug can be shown to be effective, and have an acceptable side effect profile, in people who better represent the general population. Further information will also be obtained on how the drug should be used, the optimal dosage regimen and the possible side effects.
 New Drug Submission - If the results from phase III continue to be favourable, the drug manufacturer can submit a new drug submission ("NDS") to the TPD. A drug manufacturer can submit an NDS regardless of whether the clinical trials were carried out in Canada. The TPD reviews all the information gathered during the development of the drug and assesses the risks and benefits of the drug. If it is judged that, for a specific patient population and specific conditions of use, the benefits of the drug outweigh the known risks, the HPFB will approve the drug by issuing a notice of compliance.
 
United States
 The process required before a prescription drug product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
 
completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory and/or Manufacturing Practice regulations;
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
approval by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
for some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA's regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the prescription drug product candidate for each proposed indication;
submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA"); and
FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the Company cannot be certain that any approvals for its prescription drug product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator's brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
 An independent institutional review board ("IRB"), at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries.
 The Company's commercial partners may plan to seek orphan drug designation for certain indications qualified for such designation. The U.S., E.U. and other jurisdictions may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a "rare disease or condition." Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the development, review and approval process. However, this designation provides an exemption from marketing and authorization (NDA) fees.
 The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs and indications which are designed to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions. These include programs such as Breakthrough Therapy designations, Fast Track designations, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, which the Company may need to rely upon in order to receive timely approval or to be competitive.
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including current Good Manufacturing Practices, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.
 Controlled Substances
 In the United States, the possession and sale of psychedelic and hallucinogenic products are illegal under federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Many psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin, are strictly controlled under the CSA as Schedule I substances. The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a "closed system" of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 Facilities that research, manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics.
 For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA's estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 Individual U.S. states also establish and maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
