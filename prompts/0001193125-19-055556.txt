Overview 
 We are a clinical stage drug development company advancing targeted therapeutics for the treatment of patients with unmet medical needs in hematology and oncology. We have a highly experienced management team with a proven track record of success in hematology and oncology drug development. We are an ambitious company, oriented towards achieving the successful registration and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 During the third quarter of 2018, we acquired from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) our lead drug candidate momelotinib, a potent, selective and orally-bioavailable dual JAK1/JAK2 (Janus kinase 1 and 2) and ACVR1 (Activin A receptor type 1) inhibitor. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis and has demonstrated a potentially differentiated therapeutic profile encompassing anemia-related clinical benefits, as well as achieving substantive splenic volume reduction and constitutional symptom control (see additional discussion below under Momelotinib  A Potent and Selective JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 Inhibitor). 
 In December 2018, we reported new clinical data for momelotinib collated from the two completed SIMPLIFY Phase 3 clinical trials and a translational biology study in transfusion dependent patients with myelofibrosis. Data from the latter study were also concurrently presented in a poster at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego, California. We reported aggregated transfusion independence responses from more than 150 intermediate and high-risk transfusion dependent myelofibrosis patients demonstrating robust and consistent response rates within and across the clinical studies. More than 44% of these patients became transfusion free for at least 12 weeks and nearly 50% were transfusion independent for at least 8 weeks. 
 We are advancing discussions with regulators to determine the registration path for momelotinib and expect to report next steps in the first half of 2019. Our anticipated registration strategy envisions conducting one additional Phase 3 trial in second line myelofibrosis patients, in order to recapitulate the meaningful clinical benefits observed in the two previously completed Phase 3 trials. 
 We are also advancing SRA737, our potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DNA Damage Response (DDR) replication stress response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress (RS) is induced by factors such as oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1 or MYC), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or FANCA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other genomic alterations. Replication stress can also be induced by certain exogeneous factors, such as the use of low-dose gemcitabine (LDG). In general, replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic replication stress, either alone or in combination with LDG, in a range of tumor indications. The combination of SRA737 with other modalities, such as other agents that target the DDR network and immuno-oncology agents, may also provide synergistic anti-tumor activity via a variety of potential biological mechanisms. Importantly, the oral bioavailability of SRA737 may afford greater dosing flexibility for both monotherapy and combination therapy settings than is possible with intravenously administered agents. 
 We are pursuing an innovative development plan for SRA737, which is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. Our SRA737-01 trial is intended to evaluate SRA737s potential to induce synthetic lethality as monotherapy, while the SRA737-02 trial is intended to evaluate the combination of SRA737 potentiated by subtherapeutic LDG. 
 During the second quarter of 2018, we further refined our SRA737-01 monotherapy study to focus on high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), supported by emerging data in the field that provides clinical validation for 
 
4 


  Chk1 inhibition in this indication. Accordingly, we prioritized the enrollment of genetically defined HGSOC patients into this trial, while continuing to enroll patients into the trials other indications. 
 We commenced the Cohort Expansion Phase 2 portion of the SRA737-02 Phase 1/2 LDG Combination trial during the second quarter of 2018, which has been enrolling patients across four indications. We also modified this study to add and prioritize for the enrollment of a cohort of genetically defined HGSOC patients, replacing an originally proposed cohort of urothelial cancer patients. 
 We expect to report preliminary data from both trials in the first half of 2019. 
 In addition, we are designing clinical trials and conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR-targeted agents, including poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as well as with immuno-oncology therapeutics, that could guide the next wave of clinical development for our asset, potentially further broadening its therapeutic utility. In the first quarter of 2018, we announced an agreement with Janssen Research & Development, LLC (Janssen), under which they have agreed to supply us with the PARP inhibitor niraparib, facilitating the potential initiation of a PARP inhibitor combination trial with SRA737 for the treatment of prostate cancer. We are currently evaluating the optimal timing to commence this trial within the context of our recently expanded portfolio. 
 Our pipeline also includes SRA141, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7 kinase (Cdc7). Cdc7 is a key regulator of DNA replication and is involved in the DDR network, making it a compelling emerging target for the potential treatment of a broad range of tumor types. During the third quarter of 2018, we successfully completed the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SRA141 and we have prepared for a potential Phase 1/2 trial with this drug candidate in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We are currently evaluating the optimal timing to commence this trial within the context of our recently expanded portfolio. 
 We retain the global commercialization rights to momelotinib, SRA737 and SRA141. 
 Our Strategy 
 Key elements of our long-term business strategy are to: 
 

 | Achieve Regulatory Approval for Momelotinib. We are advancing discussions with regulators to determine the registration path for momelotinib and anticipate reporting next steps in the first half of 2019. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis and has demonstrated a potentially differentiated therapeutic profile encompassing anemia-related clinical benefits, as well as achieving substantive splenic volume and constitutional symptom control. Our anticipated registration strategy envisions conducting one additional Phase 3 trial in second line myelofibrosis patients to recapitulate the meaningful clinical benefits observed in the two previously completed Phase 3 trials.

 | Continue the Clinical Development of SRA737. We plan to advance SRA737 for the possible treatment of a broad range of cancers, initially focusing on indications where we believe SRA737 has the best potential for demonstrating anti-tumor activity and where there is a significant unmet medical need. The two Phase 1/2 clinical trials for SRA737 currently underway in the United Kingdom are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SRA737 both as monotherapy and in combination with low-dose gemcitabine. Within these trials, we are evaluating the efficacy of SRA737 in prospectively-selected subjects with genetically defined tumors predicted to be more likely to derive benefit from Chk1 inhibition. These studies are designed to help assess potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development.

to treat a wide variety of cancer indications, and possibly non-cancer indications, as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maximize the Global Commercial Value of Our Product Candidates. As we further develop our product candidates, we plan to build a commercial infrastructure with the capability to directly market our products, once approved, to hematologists and oncologists in North America and possibly other major geographies that are core to our commercial strategy. We plan to enter into collaborations for the marketing and commercialization of our products in additional geographies at an appropriate time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Opportunistically Broaden Our Proprietary Pipeline by Acquiring Product Candidates. We plan to opportunistically acquire additional oncology product candidates through in-licensing or other strategic opportunities in order to expand our pipeline and leverage the full potential of our development capabilities.

Our Lead Product Candidate  Momelotinib 
 Myelofibrosis 
 Myelofibrosis is a disorder involving the stem-cells that give rise to blood cells, and is driven by molecular abnormalities that activate the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. The Janus kinases (JAKs) play a central role in the regulation of blood cell production, controlling survival, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells as well as the function of mature cells. Abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is central to the development of myelofibrosis by driving proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, and progression of disease. 
 The three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis are (1) progressive anemia, often in association with thrombocytopenia (deficiency of platelets in the blood) or other cytopenias (blood cell deficiencies); (2) constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, fever, cachexia (wasting), bone pain, pruritus (itching), and weight loss; and (3) organ enlargement, principally of the spleen and less often the liver, due to these organs attempting to produce blood cells, which can cause commonly associated symptoms such as abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, dyspnea (labored breathing), and diarrhea. The median survival for all patients with myelofibrosis is about six years but is considerably worse for intermediate 2- and high-risk patients at 4 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Besides causing disease-related morbidity, myelofibrosis may result in early death from leukemic progression, which can occur in about 20% of patients, and complications arising from progressive bone marrow failure, portal or pulmonary hypertension, infections, clotting, bleeding, and cardiovascular complications. 
 Myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition with an incidence of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 person-years because of its chronic nature and disabling course. It is estimated that 18,000 patients are living with myelofibrosis in the United States. Median age at diagnosis is 67 years. Myelofibrosis may occur de novo as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or may arise from a preexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including primarily polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocytosis (ET). 
 Importance of Anemia in Myelofibrosis 
 Anemia is a cardinal feature of myelofibrosis, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence is a hallmark of the late-stage disease. Within a year of diagnosis, 45% of patients with myelofibrosis are already RBC transfusion dependent and eventually, nearly all will develop transfusion dependence. 
 Transfusion dependence is the most important negative prognostic factor for survival for patients with myelofibrosis. Transfusions are associated with both acute and chronic health risks, and they place a significant burden on both the patient and the health care system. Severe anemia and transfusion dependence are 
 
6 


  independent predictors of poor prognosis and are inversely correlated with quality of life. Conversely, response to anemia-targeted therapies has been associated with improvement in quality of life. The prognostic effect of anemia was recently demonstrated in 1,109 consecutive PMF patients at the Mayo Clinic, 86% of whom presented with some degree of anemia. Even mild anemia impaired survival, while severe anemia (defined as Hgb level of < 8 g/dL or transfusion dependence) was associated with > 1.5-fold increase in risk of death compared with moderate anemia (Hgb level of 8-10 g/dL). 
 There are no effective treatments for myelofibrosis-associated anemia, with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, describing all therapeutic options to address this issue as minimally effective. 
 Momelotinib  A Potent and Selective JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 Inhibitor 
 Momelotinib is a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1, under development for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. Momelotinib was discovered by Cytopia Research, which commenced an initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in 2009. Cytopia was acquired by YM BioSciences, Inc. in 2010, which continued clinical development of the compound, before its own acquisition by Gilead in 2013. Amongst other clinical studies, Gilead conducted two registration-track Phase 3 trials in subjects with myelofibrosis, GS-US-352-0101 (SIMPLIFY-1) and GS-US-352-1214 (SIMPLIFY-2). In August 2018, we wholly acquired the momelotinib program from Gilead and assumed the role of IND sponsor in September 2018 with the intent to continue development of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Several members of our senior management team were previously executives at Cytopia and/or YM BioSciences and led the early development of momelotinib. 
 Following our acquisition of the program, we conducted a comprehensive review of data from the two Phase 3 trials of momelotinib, versus ruxolitinib (SIMPLIFY-1) and best available therapy (BAT) (SIMPLIFY-2), as well as GS-US-352-1672, a Phase 2, open-label, translational biology trial of momelotinib in transfusion-dependent subjects with myelofibrosis. In aggregate, our analyses across a variety of datasets show consistent benefit in the three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis across a spectrum of intermediate-high risk patients with myelofibrosis, both JAK inhibitor naïve and previously JAK inhibitor exposed: namely, (1) anemia and transfusion dependency, (2) constitutional symptoms, and (3) enlarged spleen, consistent with the compounds differentiated inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1. Although SIMPLIFY-1 met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior spleen volume reduction, it did not meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in total symptom score; and although SIMPLIFY-2 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in spleen volume, it did meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in total symptom score. In both SIMPLIFY studies, additional secondary endpoints related to transfusion independence rate, transfusion dependence rate, and rate of red blood cell transfusions all favored momelotinib over control and supported the potential for momelotinib to provide meaningful anemia benefits. As such, we have determined that there is substantial clinical justification for further development of momelotinib. 
 Among the JAK-inhibitor class, momelotinib uniquely inhibits Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and ACVR1. All three targets contribute to disease manifestations of myelofibrosis in complex and overlapping ways. The dominant roles for each in driving the various disease manifestations include: JAK1, abnormal cytokine production and immune dysregulation; JAK2, clonal myeloid proliferation; and ACVR1, anemia. Evidence suggests that momelotinib can provide an array of differentiated and compelling anemia-related clinical benefits, while also providing symptomatic and splenic benefits clinically comparable to the approved standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Specifically, via inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, momelotinib is uniquely positioned as the only JAK-inhibitor demonstrated to provide comparable splenic benefit when compared directly to ruxolitinib in the JAK inhibitor treatment-naïve setting, while Phase 3 data strongly suggest the potential for momelotinib to provide substantial symptom benefit for both JAK-inhibitor treatment-naïve and exposed patients with myelofibrosis. In addition, momelotinib induces robust, clinically meaningful and consistent anemia benefits, likely via inhibition of ACVR1 and JAK1, in the two momelotinib Phase 3 trials and in the Phase 2 translational biology trial (GS-US-352-1672) in transfusion-dependent patients.

 Myelofibrosis-associated anemia is dependent on a number of factors and involves the hyperactivation of two parallel signal transduction pathways that drive production of the peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron metabolism, and elevated levels in myelofibrosis perturbs iron homeostasis and exacerbates anemia. The principle pathway directing hepcidin expression involves activation of ACVR1, whereas a secondary pathway increases hepcidin in response to inflammation and JAK-STAT signaling. Momelotinib directly inhibits both ACVR1 and JAK1/2 to effectively limit hepcidin production. This unique profile induces a dose-dependent decrease in serum hepcidin, restoring iron homeostasis and alleviating anemia. 
 In a nonclinical anemia model, momelotinib treatment increased circulating plasma iron, RBC production, and Hgb levels consistent with the observed reduction in inflammatory cytokine and hepcidin levels associated with inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1.This effect of momelotinib was further validated by data from trial GS-US-352-1672 in an advanced, transfusion-dependent myelofibrosis population in which 34% and 39% of patients achieved transfusion independence for at least 12 and 8 weeks, respectively. Median plasma hepcidin levels declined acutely after momelotinib dosing and chronically over the entire 24-week dosing period, suggesting momelotinib induced a sustained reduction of both predose (basal) and postdose levels of hepcidin. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis, a substantial reduction in transfusion frequency was also observed in subjects who did not achieve complete transfusion independence. 
 Similarly, substantially higher rates of transfusion independence and lower rates of transfusion dependency were observed in momelotinib-treated subjects compared with ruxolitinib or BAT-treated subjects in the SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 pivotal trials. In an exploratory aggregate analysis including 152 transfusion dependent patients treated with momelotinib across the SIMPLIFY-1, SIMPLIFY-2, and GS-US-352-1672 trials, the combined 8- and 12-week transfusion independence response rates across this continuum of JAK-inhibitor naïve and exposed, intermediate- and high-risk myelofibrosis patients, were 48.7% and 44.1%, respectively. The rate of transfusion independence in transfusion-dependent subjects, along with other anemia benefits, were broadly consistent across these trials, and are consistent with the empirical findings of a pronounced anemia benefit observed in initial Phase 1/2 momelotinib clinical studies. 
 In addition, there is extensive evidence of momelotinibs sustained positive effects on hemoglobin (Hgb) and other anemia endpoints. A robust and long-lasting increase in Hgb was observed in the GS-US-352-1672 trial, which enrolled only transfusion-dependent subjects. A similar observation was noted in the JAK inhibitor naïve SIMPLIFY-1 trial, where a rapid and sustained increase in Hgb was observed in subjects randomized to momelotinib, which contrasted with the acute and profound reduction in Hgb by treatment with the standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Notably, subjects who crossed over to momelotinib treatment following 24 weeks of ruxolitinib therapy experienced a rapid and substantive increase in Hgb, ultimately achieving sustained Hgb levels that exceeded those observed in the pretreatment baseline period. 
 In totality, over 1,200 subjects have been treated with momelotinib across more than 20 clinical studies, with over 550 myelofibrosis patients treated to date. Uniquely among the JAK inhibitor class, this substantive body of clinical data has demonstrated consistent and reproducible therapeutic benefits for momelotinib across all three hallmarks of myelofibrosis, anemia, enlarged spleen and symptoms. In general, momelotinib has proven to be generally well tolerated, with certain patients having received continuous daily dosing of momelotinib for more than 7 years, indicative of momelotinibs potential to provide long-term tolerability and sustained benefit. In the randomized phases of Simplify 1 and Simplify 2 the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events for subjects treated with momelotinib were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, headache, asthenia and nausea. The most commonly reported Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were anemia, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, pneumonia and cardiac failure. These SAEs include events assessed as both related and unrelated to momelotinib and each occurred in < 4% of subjects. 
 Momelotinib  Next Steps 
 We are currently advancing discussions with regulators to determine the registration path for momelotinib and expect to report next steps in the first half of 2019. Our anticipated registration strategy envisions conducting one 
 
8 


  additional Phase 3 trial in second line myelofibrosis patients, to recapitulate the meaningful clinical benefits observed in the two previously completed Phase 3 trials. 
 Our DDR Programs  SRA737 and SRA141 
 Background on DDR and its Role in Cancer 
 Cancer is a leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 600,000 deaths and approximately 1.8 million new cases estimated to occur in the United States in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). The International Agency for Research on Cancer projects that in 2030, 21.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer and 13 million will die of cancer in that year worldwide. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective for patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations where the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery or radiation. The goal of drug therapy is to kill cancer cells or to damage cellular components required for the rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways to preferentially kill cancer cells. While heightened vigilance, new diagnostic tests, combination regimens and targeted therapies have resulted in improvements in overall survival for some cancer patients, we believe that there is still a necessity for continued innovation in the treatment of cancer. 
 Our genomic DNA is continuously subject to damage due to external sources, such as chemicals, radiation and viruses, or internal sources, such as reactive oxygen species generated during cellular metabolism or the process of DNA replication itself. Our cells have developed a highly coordinated array of mechanisms to monitor and detect DNA damage, pause the cell cycle, and resolve DNA damage in order to maintain genomic integrity, that are collectively known as the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. 
 While the DDR network is instrumental in maintaining genomic integrity in normal cells, mutations within the network occur frequently in certain cancers resulting in genomic instability, an established hallmark of cancer and enabler of mutagenesis. The genomic instability and mutational capacity of tumors provides them with a selective advantage over normal cells by enabling continual proliferation and survival, as well as by engendering adaptive mechanisms for developing resistance to chemotherapy and other standards-of-care. Tumor cells accommodate genomic instability despite the genetic mutation of certain DDR and cell cycle genes through an enhanced dependency on the remaining components of the DDR network. 
 In contrast, non-transformed normal cells have redundant cell cycle checkpoints and multiple complementary DNA repair pathways, which should render them less sensitive to DDR targeting agents. This strategy has been likened to striking at an Achilles heel of cancer, and therapeutic strategies increasingly are focusing on targeting the DDR network to exploit this intrinsic weakness of tumors. 
 Research into the DDR network has already contributed to the discovery of new treatments for cancer patients. Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are the first approved DDR-targeting drugs. These agents demonstrate robust efficacy in patients with underlying defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR), an important DNA repair pathway within the DDR network. 
 Notwithstanding this success, the DDR network represents fertile ground for the development of new cancer therapies. While PARP inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of cancers with HRR deficiencies, other DDR targets with distinct biological functions are likely to provide broad benefit to patients whose tumors 
 
9 


  harbor distinct DDR network alterations. Among these emerging targets are Chk1 and Cdc7, where recent clinical and preclinical research suggest significant therapeutic potential through modulation of these proteins in hyperproliferating tumors with DDR alterations and genomic instability. Our DDR program is oriented to expanding beyond the scope of PARP inhibitors by striking at targets that control DNA replication, cell cycle progression and unique aspects of the DDR network. 
 Chk1  A Central Regulator of the DDR Replication Stress Response 
 One of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability. A major source of genomic instability in certain tumors arises as a consequence of dysregulated cell cycle checkpoints and aberrant DNA replication, resulting in high replication stress (RS), which is manifested by stalled replication forks and associated DNA damage. 
 Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a serine-threonine kinase and master regulator of cell cycle progression and the DDR replication stress response. Chk1 regulates multiple cell-cycle phases, temporarily inhibiting the progression of cell replication and division in order to ensure proper replication of the genome and repair of collapsed or damaged replication forks. Chk1 stabilizes stalled replication forks, manages origin firing to avoid further replication stress, and mediates DNA repair via homologous recombination in the event of fork collapse. Tumors with high RS become reliant on Chk1 to mitigate the potentially catastrophic consequences of excess genomic instability. As such, Chk1 represents a promising therapeutic target in cancers with high RS, as inhibiting Chk1 drives excessive genomic instability which can result in replication catastrophe and tumor cell death. 
 Functional alterations in genes such as CCNE1, MYC, RAS, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53, which are prevalent in certain cancer cells, have been demonstrated to significantly increase RS. In such cancer cells, high levels of intrinsic RS result in near threshold levels of genomic instability. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to be synthetically lethal to cancer cells harboring these genomic alterations.
 The standard chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building blocks, thereby functioning as a strong extrinsic inducer of replication stress, even at subtherapeutic concentrations. This provides a unique opportunity to potentially treat tumors harboring varying degrees of intrinsic replication stress with this novel combination. 
 SRA737, a Potent, Highly Selective, Orally Bioavailable Chk1 Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1 being investigated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials that were initiated in the third quarter of 2016 in the United Kingdom under a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA). SRA737 was licensed to us in September 2016 and in January 2017, we successfully transferred sponsorship of the trials to Sierra. In May 2017, we received clearance to enhance these studies by incorporating the prospective enrollment of patients with genetically-defined tumors. 
 SRA737-01 Phase 1/2 Monotherapy Trial 
 This clinical study is evaluating SRA737 monotherapy in subjects with genetically-defined tumors that harbor genomic alterations linked to increased replication stress, and therefore hypothesized to be more sensitive to Chk1 inhibition. The multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 trial consists of two phases, a Dose Escalation Phase 1 and a Cohort Expansion Phase 2. 
 During the first quarter of 2018, we provided an update on the SRA737 development program. For the SRA737-01 Phase 1/2 Monotherapy trial, we reported that the Dose Escalation Phase 1 portion of the study was in the final stages of optimizing the SRA737 dose regimen and that the Cohort Expansion Phase 2 portion of the study was ongoing, enrolling genetically-defined patients across five specific indications. 
 
10 


 During the second quarter of 2018, we further refined our monotherapy study to focus on high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), supported by emerging data in the field that provides clinical validation for Chk1 inhibition in this indication. Accordingly, we prioritized the enrollment of genetically defined HGSOC patients into this trial, while continuing to enroll patients into the trials other indications. We anticipate preliminary data from our monotherapy trial will be reported in the first half of 2019. 
 SRA737-02 Phase 1/2 Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combination Trial 
 Extensive preclinical data, as well as emerging clinical data, support the synergistic interaction between Chk1 inhibition and gemcitabine. Gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building blocks, and targets proliferating cells by inducing replication stress through induction of stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks. Low concentrations of gemcitabine cause a prolonged cell cycle S-phase and induce hallmarks of replication stress without inducing overt cytotoxicity. The critical role of Chk1 in mediating cellular responses to replication stress affords the opportunity to combine SRA737 with sub-therapeutic concentrations of the replication stress-inducing agent gemcitabine. 
 This clinical study consists of three segments: 
 

 | A Standard-Dose Triplet Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1. This phase evaluated a triplet combination of SRA737 with standard-dose gemcitabine and cisplatin in subjects with solid tumors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1, where cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects are being given escalating doses of SRA737 on an intermittent schedule in addition to low dose gemcitabine until the combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Cohort Expansion Phase 2, exploring the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 plus low-dose gemcitabine in prospectively enrolled genetically-defined subjects with tumors that harbor genomic alterations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition via synthetic lethality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During the first quarter of 2018, we provided an update on this trial, reporting that: 
 

 | the Standard-Dose Triplet Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1 was complete,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1 had made significant progress,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Cohort Expansion Phase 2 was anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2018 with targeted enrollment of genetically-selected patients across four indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During the second quarter of 2018, we modified this study to add and prioritize enrollment for a cohort of genetically defined HGSOC patients, replacing an originally proposed cohort of urothelial cancer patients. 
 Preliminary data from this trial is anticipated to be reported in the first half of 2019. 
 SRA737 PARPi Combination Program Initiation and Supply Agreement 
 In February 2018, we announced an agreement with Janssen where they will supply the PARP inhibitor niraparib, facilitating the initiation of a PARPi combination trial with SRA737 for the treatment of prostate cancer. 
 Preclinical studies performed by ourselves and others have demonstrated synergy between PARP inhibitors and inhibitors of the Chk1 pathway, including SRA737, in contexts where PARP inhibitors have minimal activity, such as HRR proficient and PARP inhibitor resistant cancer cell lines. PARP inhibitors impede the repair of single-strand DNA breaks, resulting in stalled DNA replication forks and the generation of double strand breaks that make the cell highly reliant on HRR, which is regulated by Chk1. The combined inhibition of both pathways is the basis for our drug combination strategy of SRA737 with niraparib. 
 
11 


 The open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 dose-ranging study we have prepared to conduct will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of SRA737 in combination with niraparib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Janssen will provide us with niraparib, while we will conduct and control the study. We are currently evaluating the optimal timing to commence this trial within the context of our recently expanded portfolio. 
 SRA737 Potential Combination with Immuno-Oncology Therapeutics 
 Emerging preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that dual targeting of the DDR network (via certain genetic mutational backgrounds or small molecule inhibitors) in conjunction with immuno-oncology agents can result in synergistic efficacy. We have been conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with immuno-oncology agents in order to assess anticipated synergies between these two drug classes. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reported preclinical data demonstrating that SRA737 synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) models in a poster presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Conference on Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy in Miami Beach, Florida. 
 Additional SRA737 Trials and Development Activities 
 In order to obtain regulatory approval and potentially commercialize SRA737, we will need to complete the clinical trials described above and then conduct registration-oriented Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3 clinical trials in well-defined, tissue-specific, or possibly genetically-specific, patient populations in order to thoroughly and robustly evaluate the safety and efficacy of SRA737. 
 We anticipate including U.S. clinical trial sites in the subsequent development of SRA737 and, as appropriate, we intend to submit an IND to the FDA. 
 If the efficacy data obtained in some or all of the subsequent Phase 2 clinical trials are highly compelling, we plan to discuss accelerated registration paths and other regulatory designations with regulatory agencies. In order to obtain marketing approval to commercialize SRA737, a New Drug Application (NDA) must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA in the United States, and a marketing authorization application must be submitted to and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Moreover, when a diagnostic device, such as a device used to identify subsets of patients with a genetic alteration who may derive meaningful benefit from a product, is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, the FDA and other regulatory authorities generally require that the companion diagnostic be approved before or concurrent with approval of the therapeutic product and before the therapeutic product can be commercialized. Commensurate with global regulatory submissions, we will need to validate processes at large scale manufacturing facilities in advance of pre-approval inspections, marketing authorizations and product launch. 
 SRA141, a Highly Selective, Orally Available Cdc7 Inhibitor 
 Cdc7 is a serine-threonine kinase which acts as an essential regulator of both DNA replication and the DDR network. Over-expression of Cdc7 and its partner proteins is correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and poor survival in a broad range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In preclinical studies, inhibition of Cdc7 has been shown to cause cancer cell death in a p53-independent manner, and to induce tumor stasis or regression in a variety of in vivo cancer models. 
 SRA141 is a highly selective, orally available small molecule inhibitor of Cdc7. SRA141 was licensed to us in May 2016 from Carna Biosciences, Inc., Kobe, Japan (Carna). 
 Status of Our Preclinical Development Program for SRA141 
 We are pursuing a robust program of preclinical studies with SRA141 to evaluate tumor responses and dosing regimens across a variety of indications in order to inform our clinical development plans and possible patient 
 
12 


  selection strategies. Preclinical data and published literature suggest a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies with potential for response to Cdc7 inhibitors. A genetically defined patient selection strategy focusing on drivers of Cdc7 inhibitor sensitivity may help facilitate clinical trial execution. During the third quarter of 2018, we successfully completed the IND process with the FDA for SRA141 and we have prepared for a Phase 1/2 trial with this drug candidate in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We are currently evaluating the optimal timing to commence this trial within the context of our recently expanded portfolio. 
 Asset Purchase Agreement 
 In August 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Gilead whereby we acquired worldwide rights to the pharmaceutical product momelotinib, an investigational inhibitor of the JAKs and Activin A receptor, together with all related intellectual property rights and certain other related assets. Pursuant to the agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment of $3.0 million in August 2018. Milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $195.0 million may become payable to Gilead upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones events, including a milestone payment of $5.0 million upon the dosing of the first patient in a registrational clinical trial. In addition, we are required to pay Gilead mid-teen to high twenty percent tiered royalties based upon net sales. 
 License Agreements 
 CRT Pioneer Fund LP License Agreement 
 In September 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF) for worldwide rights, know-how and materials to develop SRA737, a small molecule inhibitor targeting Chk1, a promising therapeutic target to treat cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment of $7.0 million to CPF in October 2016 and paid $2.0 million to CPF in January 2017 for the successful transfer of two ongoing Phase I clinical trials. Additional milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $319.5 million may become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, we are required to pay CPF, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed until the later of (i) the date when such licensed product is no longer covered by a valid patent claim within the licensed intellectual property, (ii) the expiration of any data, marketing or other statutory exclusivity rights covering the licensed product, or (iii) a specified period after the first commercial sale of the licensed product. Such royalties will be reduced on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis under certain conditions, including if certain generic competition exists in such country, or if we are required to pay royalties to third parties in order to develop or commercialize the licensed product. 
 The license agreement will expire on the date of expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to CPF. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the license agreement, subject to certain cure provisions, and CPF may terminate the license agreement in certain limited circumstances as described in the license agreement. The license agreement may also be terminated at any time by us upon 90 days prior written notice to CPF. 
 Carna Biosciences, Inc. License Agreement 
 In May 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Carna Biosciences, Inc. (Carna) for worldwide rights to develop and commercialize SRA141, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting Cdc7. In exchange for this exclusive right, we paid Carna an upfront payment of $0.9 million in June 2016. We will be required to pay Carna milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $270.0 million upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestone events, including a milestone payment of $4.0 million upon dosing of the first patient in the first Phase 1 clinical trial for SRA 141. In addition, for product candidates defined under the license agreement, we are required to pay Carna on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered single-digit royalties on net sales. 
 
13 


 The license agreement will expire on the date of expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Carna. Following the expiration of the license agreement, we will obtain a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to develop and commercialize products relating to the licensed intellectual property worldwide for any use. Carna may terminate the license agreement if we materially breach the agreement, subject to certain cure provisions. The license agreement may also be terminated at any time by us upon 30 days prior written notice to Carna. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for momelotinib, SRA737, SRA141 and future product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
 We have acquired all rights to patent portfolios directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to momelotinib and other JAK 1/2 and ACVR1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2018, these rights included three issued U.S. patents comprising claims directed to compositions of momelotinib and methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. Two of these patents will expire in 2028 while the third patent will expire in 2030, absent any extensions. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also include 53 issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent application in 49 jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and others comprising claims directed to compositions of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2028, absent any adjustments or extension. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also included two issued U.S. utility patents and one pending reissue application comprising claims directed to different polymorphs and salt forms of momelotinib, and methods of their use for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications. These patents will expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extension. Note that for issued U.S. patents, up to five years of patent term extension is available for a single patent directed to the composition of momelotinib bringing the possible patent exclusivity in the U.S. out to 2040. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also include three issued foreign patents and 14 pending foreign patent applications in 15 jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong-Kong, India, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan comprising claims directed to different polymorphs and salt forms of momelotinib. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extension. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also included four issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent applications in five jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and South America comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of anemia. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also included one pending U.S. utility application comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of ACVR1-mediated diseases. Any patents issuing from these utility applications are expected to expire 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, these rights also include one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application and one pending foreign application in Taiwan comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of AVCR1-mediated diseases. Any patents issuing from this application are expected to expire after 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. We have filed and will continue to file patent application directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of momelotinib as they develop. 
 We have exclusively licensed CPFs rights to patents owned by Cancer Research Technology (CRT), a subsidiary of Cancer Research UK (CRUK) directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to SRA737 and other Chk1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2018, these rights included one issued U.S. patent and two pending U.S. patent applications comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging 
 
14 


  agent. Any patents issuing from this U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2018, these rights also included 25 issued foreign patents and 12 pending foreign patent applications in 16 foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. These foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, these rights also include three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications comprising claims directed to biomarkers and patient selection when using SRA737 to treat cancer indications and methods of using SRA737 in combination with PARPi and WEE1 inhibitor for inhibiting tumor reduction. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA737 as they develop. 
 We have exclusively licensed from Carna patent applications directed to the SRA141 composition of matter, alone or in combination with an M-phase inhibitor and methods of use for the combination. As of December 31, 2018, we were the exclusive licensee of two U.S. patents, expiring in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions, and one pending U.S. patent application, both comprising composition of matter claims directed to SRA141. Any patents issuing from this U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2018, this exclusively-licensed portfolio included 21 issued foreign patents and seven pending foreign patent applications in 22 foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, Korea and Mexico and others comprising composition of matter claims directed to SRA141. The foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, this portfolio also included one issued U.S. utility patent. The issued U.S. utility will expire in 2035 including any adjustment but absent any extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, this portfolio also includes two pending foreign patent applications in Europe, and Japan comprising composition of matter claims directed to a combination of SRA141 and an M-phase inhibitor and methods of use for the combination for treating cancer. Any patents issuing from these pending applications will expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA141 as they develop. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other oncology companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory 
 
15 


  review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before momelotinib, SRA737, SRA141 or any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our scientific advisors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party. 
 Competition 
 The hematology and oncology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 To our knowledge, there is currently one approved drug for the treatment of myelofibrosis that specifically targets JAK inhibition, ruxolitinib, marketed by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi® in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi in rest of the world. In addition, there are a number of JAK inhibitor competitors in clinical development, at a similar state of development or more advanced than us. To our knowledge, Celgene Corporation is developing fedratinib, for which an NDA has been submitted with the FDA, and CTI Biopharma Corporation is developing pacritinib, which is currently in a Phase 2 dose finding study in the United States. However, to our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that target both JAK and ACVR1 inhibition on the market, nor in development. Other competitors in the myelofibrosis market include Acceleron, which is developing luspatercept in a Phase 2 clinical trial for myelofibrosis in conjunction with Celgene, and several additional companies in the early stages of development. If momelotinib is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. While we believe that momelotinib may have the ability to provide an anemia benefit, which we believe is unique to the JAK inhibitor class of agents, the market for momelotinib is competitive, and physicians and other prescribers may not recommend or prescribe momelotinib over other competing products. 
 To our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Chk1 on the market, but there are a number of competitors in clinical development, at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us. To our knowledge, Esperas Pharma is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. To our knowledge, Eli Lilly and Company is developing prexasertib, an intravenous Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor in several clinical settings, the most advanced of which are in Phase 2 clinical trials. There are also preclinical programs focused on developing Chk1 inhibitors. If SRA737 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved. 
 Additionally, to our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Cdc7. To our knowledge, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company is developing an oral Cdc7 inhibitor that is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic pancreatic and colorectal cancers and Eli Lilly and Company has a Cdc7 inhibitor program that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial being conducted by Cancer Research UK. Other companies may be 
 
16 


  conducting preclinical studies of Cdc7 inhibitors as well. If SRA141 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. 
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the hematology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of momelotinib, SRA737, SRA141 and other potential product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. 
 We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. We believe that our manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our current demand and, in the event that they fail to meet our demand, adequate alternative sources for such materials exist. However, there is a risk that if supplies are interrupted or result in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. We will continue to evaluate product demand requirements and qualify alternate sources for momelotinib, SRA737 and SRA141 on an as-needed basis. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, which are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which 
 
17 


  must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLPs). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into patients, the drug is typically tested to assess endpoints such as metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the activity of the drug for a particular tissue-specific, or possibly genetically-specific patient population, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to confirm clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances, such as where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. 
 
18 


  The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription drug product, which replaced the annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 
19 


 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to a substantial application fee, which is typically increased annually. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to NDAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular

  target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivitypatent or non-patentfor a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDAs determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. Under the fast track program and FDAs accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drugs NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for 
 
21 


  direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicants product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDAs Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved products listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 
22 


 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approval an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
Patent Term Extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drugs testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and 
 
23 


  Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
 Pursuant to PPACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, reporting on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional jurisdictions, such as the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed and meet continuing education requirements. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 
 
24 


 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, contractual damages, reputation harm, and diminished profits or future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time-consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 By way of example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on 
 
25 


  the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturers subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% beginning in 2019);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extension of a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to cover drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future, including the potential repeal of all or part of PPACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. 
 We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any 
 
26 


  products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. 
 Approval in the European Union 
 In the European Union, Member States require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union Member States. We would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all European Union Member States, as well as the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization. 
 European Regulation of Clinical Trials and Grant of Marketing Authorization 
 Pharmaceutical products in the European Union are subject to regulation under comprehensive legislation enacted by the European Commission in the European Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. This directive is binding on all Member States together with ancillary legislation governing research. 
Clinical Trial Authorization 
 Clinical trials are regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. The Clinical Trials Directive requires the sponsor of an investigational medicinal product to obtain a CTA, much like an IND in the United States, from the national competent authority of a European Union Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The application for CTA must satisfy detailed requirements for the protection of trial subjects including requirements relating to consent and specific rules for minors and adults unable to consent by reason of incapacity. The CTA application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Council Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance, including the European Commission Communication 2010/C 82/01. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval. 
 A sponsor of a clinical trial must also follow certain procedures, including entering specified relevant information in the European trial database, EudraCT. In addition, Member States require that the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products be authorized. Sponsors of investigational medicinal products must ensure compliance with, among other things, GCP and good manufacturing practice (GMP) as well as requirements pertaining to safety reporting. 
 In April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The Clinical Trials Regulation goes into effect in 2019. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.

 Procedural Routes for Marketing Authorization 
 The European system for authorization of medicinal products for human use offers several routes: the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure, and the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union Member States as well as the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain categories of investigational products, including human products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurodegenerative illness; orphan medicinal products; and medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes. Applications for marketing authorization for such medicines must be submitted to the EMA, in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is generally responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. 
 The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures are applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and are both based on the principle of recognition of a marketing authorization by one or more Member States. The decentralized procedure is available for applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union Member States where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union Member State before. In this procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously in several Member States, one of them being chosen as the Reference Member State. At the end of the procedure, national marketing authorizations are granted in the Reference and in the concerned Member States. The mutual recognition procedure is used when a medicinal product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State and is compulsory to be marketed in a Member State other than that in which they were first authorized. Any national marketing authorization granted by a European Union Member States national authority can be used to support an application for its mutual recognition by other Member States. 
 Standard for Approval of a Marketing Authorization 
 The objective of the EMA is the comprehensive evaluation of benefit/risk profile of a new medicinal product going through the centralized procedure. This evaluation involves showing that the product has significant efficacy and safety, together with a satisfactory plan for risk management post-marketing. The CHMP is the EMAs expert committee responsible for human medicinal products. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial review of European Union-wide marketing authorization applications and for assessing modifications or extensions (variations) to an existing marketing authorization. It also considers the recommendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee on the safety of medicines on the market and when necessary, recommends to the European Commission changes to a medicines marketing authorization, or its suspension or withdrawal from the market. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA in the United States. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document (CTD), which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. The main scientific principle used by the CHMP in the evaluation of medicinal products is the benefit/risk ratio based on quality, efficacy, safety, and risk management considerations. The CHMP assesses whether the data it reviews comply with the ICH-harmonized Good Practices published for GCP, GMP and good laboratory practice (GLP). The CHMP also considers whether studies concluding efficacy and safety of products have sufficient statistical power. 
 When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the United Kingdom will no longer automatically comply with the standards of clinical efficacy, safety and chemistry control, and manufacture as applied by the European Medicines Directive. Applications submitted for marketing authorization under the centralized EMA procedure will no longer be automatically validated for authorization in the United Kingdom and the benefit-risk assessments conducted by the United Kingdom may not be consistent with the EMA conclusions. 
 Other Regulatory Issues 
 An exemption to the rule requiring marketing authorization permits Member States of the European Union to make a product available for compassionate use to patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or 
 
28 


  whose disease is considered life threatening, such as cancer, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product concerned must be undergoing clinical trials or the subject of application for marketing authorization. 
 Quality of the medicinal products in question is governed by the GMP Directive. This lays down the principles and guidelines of GMP for both marketed medicinal products and investigational products in clinical trials. The Directive obliges manufacturers to comply with GMP for an effective pharmaceutical quality assurance, quality control, systems for recording and reviewing complaints and a system for prompt recall of products in the distribution network. With regards to postmarketing safety of newly authorized products, the EMA is responsible for coordinating the Member States ongoing evaluation of benefit risk, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. 
 The pharmacovigilance legislation imposes a duty on Member States to collect information on the risks of products with regards to patients or public health. That information must refer to adverse events arising from the use of the medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorization as well as use outside the authorized indication and use associated with occupational exposure. 
 There is a similar obligation on the marketing authorization holder (MAH) to operate a robust pharmacovigilance system equivalent to that of the relevant Member State. The MAH must evaluate all safety and effectiveness information scientifically, consider the options for risk minimization and take appropriate measures as necessary. As part of the pharmacovigilance system, the MAH must have permanently and continuously an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance, maintain a pharmacovigilance master file, operate a risk management system for each medicinal product, monitor the outcome of risk minimization measures contained in the risk management program and continually update the risk management system and monitor the pharmacovigilance system to determine whether there are new risks or changes to the risk-benefit profile of the product(s).   Two recent developments have been introduced which further expand the European regulatory framework: the Falsified Medicines Directive and the Pharmacovigilance Directive. The Falsified Medicines Directive obliges manufacturers of medicinal products to audit their suppliers of active substances to ensure compliance with GMP. It also introduces a new obligation on product manufacturers to inform the competent authority (e.g., MHRA) and the marketing authorization holder if they become aware that these products may be falsified, whether they are being distributed through the legitimate supply chain or by illegal means. The Pharmacovigilance Directive obliges marketing authorization holders to monitor the safety of authorized products and detect any change in their risk-benefit profile. A new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to European Union authorized medicinal products). In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly. The United Kingdoms exit from the European Union (Brexit) will disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. 
 The United Kingdom enacted the Data Protection Act 2018 to directly enforce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The government of the United Kingdom has also stated that when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union it will still abide by the provisions of the GDPR. However, in the event of a no deal Brexit it is uncertain whether this commitment will still be met. In the case of a no deal Brexit, it is also uncertain whether clinical trial data and pharmacovigilance adverse event data originating from the United Kingdom will be compliant with European Union privacy legislation and whether the data will be incorporated 
 
29 


  by EMA in the assessment of the ongoing benefit-risk profile and hence continued support of European Union marketing authorizations. 
 Approval Outside the United States/European Union 
 For marketing outside the United States and the European Union, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. Whether or not FDA or European Commission approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States or the European Union, as the case may be, must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country. In certain countries, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar to those in the United States and the European Union, where approval decisions by regulators are based on the regulators review of the results of clinical trials performed for specific indications. Other countries may have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and may rely on prior marketing approval from a foreign regulatory authority in other countries such as the United States or the European Union. In many countries outside of the United States, approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.
