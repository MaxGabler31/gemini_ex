Item 1. Business.
Company Overview



SensaSure is a medical technology or “MedTech”company supplying a simple device and method to collect a breath sample for lab-based analysis. Exhaled breath contains aerosols which originate from the lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for analytics, diagnostics, and therapeutics. SensaSure’s patented method is called ExaBreath (EB) and it can collect, extract, detect and identify non-volatile compounds present in exhaled breath by utilizing existing lab-based testing infrastructure and procedures. EB is applicable in toxicology, pharmacology, and clinical biochemistry. Our EB device has not received any approval from a government agency in the European Union nor from the FDA. We can provide no assurance that any government regulatory body will clear our EB device for commercial use.



EB may enhance the overall user experience in a wide range of applications and markets such as workplace drug testing, anti-doping in sport, law enforcement, e-health, and telemedicine. In the case of anti-doping, EB immediately and substantially reduces the time, cost, and overall burden that drug programs place on athletes, other participants, and the wider stakeholders such as leagues and associations. EB may significantly improve the user experience for both donors and collectors during the sample collection process.



Drug control programs represent significant market segments due to the necessity of testing in most sports, industries, law enforcement agencies, ministries, police forces, criminal justice systems and by many employers for the insurance industry.



We believe that our business model will follow a methodology to try to reduce risks, transfer the manufacturing costs to third parties to reduce capital investment which we hope will provide relatively higher margin business based upon our EB collection device, which may improve user acceptability and analytical credibility in areas such as anti-doping in sport. This may increase the credibility and perceived value of doping control programs resulting in a stronger deterrence factor and better protection for the integrity of sport.



The global device market in drug testing is estimated to be nearly $4.5 billion in 2020 and is estimated to reach $10 billion by 2025 (According to BCC Research, Drug Testing Market Report 2019). The estimates provided here are based on varying estimates from research companies and actual numbers may vary significantly. While there are several basic types of drug tests, the most common method is urine testing.



Current Challenges



The current challenges facing the drug testing industry are many and varied. Increasing the overall effectiveness and accuracy of drug control program remains a priority. However, reducing the burden imposed upon participants in terms of time, cost, inconvenience, and intrusiveness are also important.



Our intent is to significantly improve the user experience for donors and collectors during the sample collection process as well as simplify and reduce the costs of sample preparation, packaging, and transportation to the labs. The EB method may lead to improved overall detection accuracy thus reducing the incidence of false positives and avoid legal outcomes.



Our EB device is quick to use and may provide more predictable sample collection times to enable more samples to be planned and collected. The EB device can enable new sample collection formats and work patterns (i.e., youth testing, remote collection, and monitoring by video). We believe our EB device may fulfill the unmet analytical need for a recent cannabis use and impairment test. The EB device provides a solution platform that is flexible and responsive in a wide range of applications.



Our Solution



We are in an omics revolution, and breathomics is anticipated to offer one of the most significant opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns what we believe may be a low cost and transformative breath-based technology. EB may have the potential to:

1. | ensure cleaner sports competition 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------
2. | help to make schools, roads, and workplaces safer 
3. | facilitate the detection and diagnosis of diseases earlier

Exhaled breath contains aerosols which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure owns the core IP for the design of a collection device as well as the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances present within these aerosols using a simple electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) is intended to offer an alternative to blood, urine and oral fluid collection processes in many situations.



SensaSure’s testing methodology is a non-invasive way to collect chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. We believe that SensaSure’s core technology will be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace drug testing and professional sports organizations.



Our Products and Ongoing Development



The different methods of biological sample collection for drug testing are diverse and can be expensive. The data for our device has been collected by universities and hospitals which provides us with independent research some of which has been published in journals related to drug testing. Our EB device has four main characteristics:

● | breath offers a new low cost and non-invasive sampling methodology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | breath sampling has been found to be an extremely sensitive, back-to-lab based technique, which has been developed into a complete end-to-end analytical platform for use in toxicology, pharmacology and clinical biochemistry that can provide improvements to analyses, diagnostics, and therapies. Independent studies confirm our approach for a back-to-lab technique. 
● | EB can detect a wide range of exogenous substances, such as drugs of abuse (narcotics), therapeutic drugs (antibiotics) and performance enhancing drugs used in sports (stimulants) as well as many other compounds. 
● | EB can detect a wide range of endogenous substances associated with the study of metabolomics and the determination of biomarkers. These may be used to provide health monitoring and diagnostics support. This may make EB a useful tool for breathomics and biomarker discovery. 




Since 2010, we have indirectly participated in more than 30 studies/trials worldwide conducted by:




Organization | Country | Areas of Testing with EB Device 
---------------------------------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------
UC San Diego | United States | Drugs of Abuse 
NIH NIDA | United States | Drugs of Abuse 
German Sports University | Germany | Sports Anti-Doping, Drugs of Abuse 
Jena University Hospital | Germany | Therapeutic Drugs 
University of Gent | Belgium | Drugs of Abuse, Therapeutic Drugs 
Karolinska University Hospital | Sweden | Biomarkers, Drug of Abuse 
University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein | Germany | Infectious Diseases COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 RNA)
ABF Labs | Germany | Biomarkers 
Atomic Energy Commission | France | Biomarkers 




with an additional 20 or more trials ongoing across a range of application specific areas. So far 80 substances have been detected across 25 categories using a commercial grade electrostatic filter membrane. A great amount of work and effort has been performed in the field of drug testing and anti-doping through collaborative partnerships with key industry players. Further work is planned to gather validation data and increase the IP portfolio. Our area of interest has been expanded to include more projects in the field of biomarker discovery.



Since the current distribution of our product is limited to research organizations, distribution is relatively easy as the product is sent to only a few locations. This level of business is supported by a large inventory of devices held in a flexible secure storage facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Any large quantity shipments of product are sent from Sweden. Sample and small quantity shipments are sent from the UK, where a small inventory is held at the home-office of the CEO. UK based inventory was established to facilitate ongoing operations during COVID-19 lock-down restrictions. All transportation of product is done using commercial courier services. All order processing steps, and associated paperwork is handled internally by the company’s accountant and management. The current production and delivery system functions well, even throughout the disruptions to business caused by COVID-19.

In the future, when appropriate, we will develop a larger scale production and delivery system whereby the processes will be outsourced to a 3rd party specialist manufacturing partner when required. This partner will source the piece parts, manufacture the product then assemble and package the kits before storing as inventory or drop shipping as order fulfillment. This will be done in a suitably certified facility with the relevant ISO or other quality control standards that are applicable to the medtech industry. This partner may also be used to provide all the logistical operations directly with vendors. This could include all order fulfillment requirements including any eventual volume supply agreements. There are many suitable partners available in the US and Europe who can provide the manufacturing capability as well as the entire suite of order fulfillment services into the medtech market.



While we believe that, from a technological and/or medical perspective, there are no material disadvantages to the use of our product in comparison to other commercially available alternative products. Our product is relatively new, and we currently have limited commercialization, sales and marketing experience. Our product will compete against alternative products that are well-established and are widely accepted. Many of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies such as Abbott Labs, NMS Labs and LabCorp, with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. Our success will depend in part on our ability to increase adoption of our product, expand existing relationships with our potential customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our product, where necessary. We cannot provide any assurance that our EB device will receive any regulatory approvals to sell the product commercially.



Why ExaBreath?



We believe that ExaBreath is Safe - Simple - Effective




● | EB testing is suitable for drug testing such as anti-doping in sport. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | EB is a quick, easy, and non-intrusive collection process. 
● | EB is a one-time-use device to prevent cross-contamination. 
● | EB is potentially less expensive to collect than some other matrices. 
● | Unlike urine, the detection window of EB closely mimics that of blood so EB may be a better indication of recent use, which is likely to cause impairment (driving) or enhancement (sport).




Based upon our research, we believe that the statements we have made above are accurate. It will be up to regulatory agencies such as the FDA that will conduct an analysis regarding the accuracy of these statements. We believe that our filing with the FDA will not occur for 3-5 years. There is no assurance that any regulatory body will approve or clear our EB device for use.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive profitability by scaling our business operations to achieve cost and production efficiencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




At the present time any partnership that we have regarding the study of our device is on a study by study basis.  We do not have any specific relationships that require us to perform any of the functions that are being performed by the independent research organization. As we move forward we will work to develop strategic relationships that will be beneficial to both parties.  We provide the number of units requested by the research organization and bill them for the same. We do not provide any services during the clinical or pre-clinical study.



The Opportunity



We are in an omics revolution, and breathomics (exhaled breath) may offer one of the biggest opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns a transformative breath-based technology that can potentially:

1. | detect and diagnose diseases earlier,
---+--------------------------------------
2. | make roads and workplaces safer, and 
3. | ensure cleaner sport 




Exhaled breath contains aerosols which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure owns the core IP for the design of a collection device and the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances present within these aerosols using electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) may be able to displace blood, urine, and oral fluid collection processes in certain situations as a more convenient, reliable, and less costly alternative.



SensaSure’s testing methodology is a non-invasive way to measure chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. Our core technology could be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace drug testing and professional sport organizations. Through our subsidiary there are several patents that we hope will protect our device. The table under Intellectual Property/Patents, below, provides information regarding our patents.



Our EB device has not received any approval from a government agency in the European Union nor from the FDA. We can provide no assurance that any government regulatory body will clear our EB device for commercial use.



Intellectual property



Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.





4






We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. 



As of April 30, 2022, we own 4 issued U.S. patents with 2 currently being published and 105 issued foreign patents, relating to our current EB technology.



The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.

Competition



The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete or plan to compete with manufacturers and distributors of biologic chemical testing medical devices. Our most notable competitors in the highly competitive field include Draeger, Respiratory Research Inc., Hound Labs and Cannabix Technologies Inc. Some competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:

● | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


● | broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;

Management considers the competition for SensaSure’s EB technique to consist of two main components. The first originates from the existing base of established biological specimen collection procedures. This includes sample collection types such as blood, urine, oral fluid, hair, etc. In certain applications some of these methods have been established for many decades and each offers certain advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific requirements needed. There is a vast number of companies who supply the collection kits for these matrices and many labs who have the procedures and assays to analyze multiple specimen types. Since the EB method is a back-to-lab type test, SensaSure will rely upon this existing lab infrastructure for breath testing analysis in areas such as in forensic toxicology, pharmacology (pharmacokinetics), and clinical biochemistry. We know this is a practical consideration since the EB method has been evaluated is multiple labs worldwide with data published in peer reviewed technical papers. SensaSure may engage with manufacturing partners who also produce collection kits for other matrices.



The second type of competition consists of suppliers offering other breath sample collection procedures and kits. Some of these are new ‘breathalyzer’ type instruments for detection of drugs such as cannabis in exhaled breath. These are screening devices. Results from lab-based analysis are considered confirmatory. Other types of devices are for capturing biomarkers in breath and are primarily aimed at the collection of volatiles. Some of these devices are active, complicated, bulky, and costly. Also, there is limited data to support the effectiveness, applicability, and reproducibility of these newer method types and equipment. SensaSure’s method was designed to overcome all these shortcomings. Data that supports this has been published by independent labs. None of the research, studies, and field trials that supports this published data was funded by SensaSure.



Studies and Clinical Trials



The first method procedures for EB were published in March 2015 by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm to detect multiple drugs of abuse. The EB device has been used extensively for workplace drug testing in Sweden.



There are multiple projects running across a range of application specific studies in areas such as law enforcement (cannabis breathalyzers), workplace drug testing, therapeutics, infectious disease testing, and sport anti-doping. Collaborative partnerships have been established in key areas and additional published data from ongoing studies and pilots is expected.



In early 2016, doping control in sport was identified as a ‘sweet spot’ for EB and prioritized as the target market. EB provides the anti-doping community with significant scientific, performance and logistical benefits at all stages of the process. EB offers athletes and doping control officers a quick, simple, hygienic, and non-intrusive collection procedure. It gives analytical labs and sports governing authorities the opportunity to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their anti-doping programs as well as reduce overall administrative and logistical support costs.



Also in 2016, as part of a global investment initiative in anti-doping research, the Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC) (www.cleancompetition.org/about/), funded a pilot study to assess the suitability and applicability of EB as an alternative bio matrix in anti-doping. This lab study was undertaken at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited lab in Cologne (Germany) by Dr Mario Thevis and his team. Dr Thevis is recognized as a leading world expert in the field of doping control. The Institute of Biochemistry of the German Sport University Cologne is one of the most established doping laboratories in the world. The study’s results were positive, and the proof-of-concept data was published in May 2017.





11






During 2017, the PCC funded a second larger follow-on EB lab study, also performed by Dr Thevis. This study focused on substances prohibited for in-competition testing; it too was successful. The study’s data was presented to lab directors at the 36th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne, April 2018). Further PCC funded labs studies are ongoing.



Based on the positive method characterization and validation data from both of Dr Thevis’ studies, together with data from multiple other non-sport studies/trials performed over the last eight years by various research institutes such as the Karolinska in Sweden and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in Baltimore, the decision was made to proceed with an EB field study in sport.



The PCC initiated an IRB-approved field trial and user survey for in-competition testing of athletes to establish ease-of-use and athlete acceptance. A new anti-doping specific EB sample collection kit was designed, developed, and produced in quantity to support the field trial. This new device/kit was funded by the PCC.



The trial was undertaken by existing MLB partners. CDT doping control services based in Los Angeles, collected samples from 521 MiLB players across several US teams. SMRTL, a WADA-accredited lab in Salt Lake City, analyzed the samples (across 3 matrices). The trial’s data was presented to lab directors at the 37th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne, Feb. 2019). This field trial was funded by the PCC.

Government Regulation



United States



Our products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements



Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a pre-market approval from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in orders to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
510(k) Clearance Pathway



When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III.





16






There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special; and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt. We believe that our filing with the FDA will not occur for 3-5 years.



De Novo Classification



Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.



This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”), a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.



Pre-market Approval Pathway



A pre-market approval application must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The pre-market approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) pre-market notification process. A pre-market approval application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.



After a pre-market approval application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed pre-market approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.



Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision-making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.



Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.

Clinical Trials



Clinical trials are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product.



Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.



Ongoing Regulation by the FDA



Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:




● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






18






After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.



Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs.



FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”), requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:




● | warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------




The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.



Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.



We would also be subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices.





19






European Union



Our products are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the European Union Directive (93/42/EEC), also known as the Medical Device Directive. An authorized third party, Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking. The CE Mark is contingent upon continued compliance to the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard.
Other Regions



Most major markets have different levels of regulatory requirements for medical devices. Modifications to the cleared or approved products may require a new regulatory submission in all major markets. The regulatory requirements, and the review time, vary significantly from country to country. Products can also be marketed in other countries that have minimal requirements for medical devices.
Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulations



Federal and state governmental agencies and equivalent foreign authorities subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products. Federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally funded healthcare programs. Patient privacy statutes and regulations by foreign, federal and state governments may also apply in the locations in which we do business. Descriptions of some of the U.S. laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate follows.
Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute



The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute (“Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or a specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there is no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities, such as reimbursement support programs, educational and research grants or charitable donations. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all facts and circumstances.





20






Federal Civil False Claims Act



The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the federal civil False Claims Act may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years. Qui tam actions are filed under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. Medical device manufacturers and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
Healthcare Fraud Statute



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
Sunshine Act



The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually with certain exceptions to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the request of a physician or teaching hospital, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives.
Patient Data Privacy



HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), and their implementing regulations impose obligations on covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as business associates that provide services involving the use or disclosure of personal health information to or on behalf of covered entities. These obligations, such as mandatory contractual terms, relate to safeguarding the privacy and security of protected health information. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
Other State Laws



Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.



State and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the U.S. Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA”) increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal healthcare laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies recently have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and other patient support programs, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the Anti-Kickback Statute, federal civil False Claims Act and violations of healthcare fraud and HIPAA privacy provisions.

Enforcement and Penalties for Noncompliance with Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations



Compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations requires substantial resources. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Companies settling federal civil False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute and other fraud and abuse cases also may be required to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General in order to avoid exclusion from participation (i.e., loss of coverage for their products) in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Corporate Integrity Agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance.



For additional information regarding obligations under federal healthcare statues and regulations, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—If we fail to comply with U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including those relating to kickbacks and false claims for reimbursement, we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.



United States Healthcare Reform



There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system.



For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted. The ACA contains a number of significant provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA, among other things, imposes an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of most medical devices.



In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.



Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed, and enacted federal and state legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control product costs. Additionally, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase, and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.



Human Capital Resources



As of April 30, 2022, we had 1 employee, our President and Chairman John Trainor. Our employee is note represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced difficulties with our employee. We believe our employee relations are good.
Facilities



We do not produce our EB devices. We rely upon specialist manufacturing partners. EB devices are currently not in manufacture as we hold an inventory able to support rapid high-volume shipments worldwide. Our first-generation devices were made for Sensa Bues AB by a manufacturer in Sweden. In total about 50,000 devices have been sourced and an inventory is held in Europe. These first-generation devices are our reference design for evaluation purposes and to support sales activities.





22






The current storage of our inventory, and for the last several years, has been done at a secure commercial business storage facility in Stockholm, Sweden. This type of facility allows for flexible arrangements on the volume of storage required. Also, the location allows for easy access by local management for the purposes of arranging shipping of larger volumes of devices and for the annual inventory audit by our local auditor in Stockholm. Sample and small quantity shipments are sent from the UK, where a small inventory is held at the home-office of the CEO. This is approximately 30 cubic feet of storage space within the home office. This UK based inventory was established to facilitate ongoing operations during COVID-19 lock-down restrictions. This also ensures fast turnaround time for evaluation sample requests.



Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current operational management of the company are all home-office based primarily in the UK and Sweden. Considering the current capability and trend toward working from home, the management sees the need to continue offering flexible home-office based working arrangements for existing as well as any new employees. New employees will likely be added in the USA to provide local support for commercialization plans in the target market sectors and will be home office based to ensure optimal flexibility and resilience for ongoing operations.



Our second-generation device is similar to the first-generation device but with additional features and functionality incorporated into the design at the request of our sports anti-doping partners. These application specific units, used in a large field trial for sport by Major League Baseball, were designed and manufactured in the USA.



Manufacturing of the 2nd gen EB device can be re-started if more units are required. This would involve an approximate 8-week lead-time. Alternatively, if a modified version of the EB device is required, the lead time for this unit would be dependent upon the new specification.



We anticipate the eventual outsourcing of manufacturing, storage, and delivery operations to a specialist logistics partner. Such partners can offer a flexible and scalable operation that can be highly responsive in terms of operational scope and product volumes.



This partner will source the piece parts, manufacture the product then assemble and package the kits before storing as inventory or drop shipping as order fulfillment. This will be a suitable facility in terms of level of expertise, scale, and certification. The relevant ISO or other quality control standards will be met as applicable to the medtech industry. This partner may also be used to provide all the logistical operations directly with vendors. This could include all order fulfillment requirements including any eventual volume supply agreements. There are many suitable partners available in the US and Europe who can provide the manufacturing capability as well as the entire suite of order fulfillment services into the medtech market.



Legal Proceedings



We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this filing management has no knowledge of any current or foreseeable legal proceedings.

 .

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we have included detailed compensation information for only our three most highly compensated executive officers and have not included a compensation discussion and analysis, or CD&A, of our executive compensation programs in this report. In addition, for so long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to:

● | engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes–Oxley Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






23







● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “say-on-golden parachutes;” or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparison of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.



We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of:




● | our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our issuance, in a three-year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | December 31, 2027.
--+-------------------




We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our securities and increased volatility in the price of our securities.



Finally, we are a “smaller reporting company” (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
