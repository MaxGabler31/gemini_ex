Business Overview
FOX produces and delivers compelling news, sports and entertainment content through its primary iconic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and FOX Television Stations, and leading AVOD service TUBI. The Company, with a simple structure focused on two principal reporting segments, differentiates itself in a crowded media and entertainment marketplace through the leadership positions of the Company's brands and premium programming that focus on live and "appointment-based" content, a significant presence in major markets, and broad distribution of the Company's content across traditional and digital platforms.
Our Competitive Strengths
Premium brands that resonate deeply with viewers.
Under the FOX banner, we produce and distribute content through some of the world's leading and most valued brands. Our long track record of challenging the status quo emboldens us to continue making innovative decisions, disrupting competitors and forming deeper relationships with audiences. FOX News Media is among the most influential and recognized news brands in the world. FOX Sports has earned a reputation for bold sports programming and, with its far-reaching presence in virtually every U.S. household, is a leading destination for live sports events and sports commentary. FOX Entertainment is renowned for its engaging primetime entertainment, including dramas 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star and new arrival The Cleaning Lady, its longstanding Sunday animation block featuring The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bob's Burgers and unscripted programming such as The Masked Singer and programming starring Gordon Ramsay, including Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef and Next Level Chef. These brands and others in our portfolio, including our owned and operated local television stations broadcasting under the FOX brand, hold cultural significance with consumers and commercial importance for distributors and advertisers. TUBI, a leading AVOD service, attracts a young, diverse and loyal audience to its over 45,000 programming titles. The quality of our programming and the strength of our brands maximize the value of our content through a combination of affiliate fees and advertising sales.
Leadership positions across strategically significant programming platforms.
FOX enjoys a leadership position across our core news, sports and entertainment businesses. As linear television viewership declines across the industry, "appointment-based" programming that is the FOX hallmark remains resilient. For over 20 consecutive years, FOX News has been the top-rated national cable news channel in both Monday to Friday primetime and total day viewing, according to The Nielsen Company ("Nielsen"). FOX News also finished calendar year 2021 as the #1 cable network in Monday to Friday primetime and total day viewing among total viewers for the sixth consecutive year. A leader in marquee live sports broadcasts, FOX Sports programs the National Football League ("NFL"), Major League Baseball's ("MLB") Regular Season, All-Star Game and World Series and other marquee events, including the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ("FIFA") Men's and Women's World Cup and the Super Bowl. FOX Sports programming includes the #1 show on television, America's Game of the Week. FOX Entertainment has 
delivered the youngest and most diverse audience of the broadcast networks across all programming in primetime for the past two decades. During the 2021-2022 broadcast season, FOX featured leading unscripted hit The Masked Singer, leading scripted Monday dramas 9-1-1 and 9-1-1: Lone Star and four of the top 10 comedies on broadcast television with The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers and Call Me Kat. The FOX Television Stations cover 18 Nielsen-designated market areas ("DMAs"), including 14 of the 15 largest, and was the #1 or #2 rated news provider in the hours of 5 a.m. - 9 a.m. in the majority of the markets in which it operates. FOX has helped TUBI become one of the most relevant and fastest growing AVOD services in the country in fiscal 2022, with nearly 40% growth in total view time (the total number of hours watched) compared to the prior fiscal year. Taken together, we believe our leadership positions will continue to support strong affiliate fee revenue growth and sustained advertising revenue, while enabling us to nimbly respond to the challenges traditional media companies are facing relating to rapidly evolving technologies and changes in consumer behavior.
Significant presence and relevance in major domestic markets.
The FOX portfolio combines the range of national cable and broadcast networks with the power of tailored local television. FOX News and FOX Business are available in over 70 million U.S. households and the FOX Network is available in essentially all U.S. households. Additionally, our 29 owned and operated television stations cover 18 DMAs, including 14 of the 15 largest, and maintain duopolies in 11 DMAs, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the three largest. These stations provide balanced content of national interest with programming of note to local communities, producing approximately 1,200 hours of local news coverage each week. TUBI's ubiquitous availability both online and through its app provides broad distribution of films, episodic television programming and live local and national news content. TUBI carries nearly 100 local station feeds (including feeds of our owned and operated stations), covering 50 DMAs and 24 of the top 25 markets. The breadth and depth of our footprint allows us to produce and distribute our content in a cost-effective manner and share best business practices and models across regions. It also enables us to engage audiences, develop deeper consumer relationships and create more compelling product offerings.
Attractive financial profile, including multiple revenue streams, strong balance sheet and tax asset benefit.
We have achieved strong revenue growth and profitability in a complex industry environment over the past several years, led by affiliate fee increases. Additionally, our strong balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest across our businesses, allocate resources toward investments in growth initiatives, take advantage of strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions across the range of media categories in which we operate, and return capital to our stockholders. We also benefit from a tax asset that resulted from the step-up in the tax basis of our assets following the Transaction, which will provide an annual cash tax benefit for many years.
Goals and Strategies
Maintain leading positions in live news, live sports and quality entertainment.
We have long been a leader in news, sports and entertainment programming. We believe that building on our leading market positions is essential to our success. We are investing in our most attractive growth opportunities by allocating capital to our news, sports and original entertainment programming, which we believe have distinct competitive advantages. For example, we have continued our investments in digital properties at FOX News Media, including additional investments in the FOX Nation subscription video-on-demand ("SVOD") service and the October 2021 launch of the FOX Weather free advertising-supported streaming service. In fiscal 2021, FOX Sports entered into an expanded 11-year media rights agreement with the NFL that has extended FOX Sports' coverage of premier NFC games, created new and exclusive holiday games on the FOX Network and expanded FOX's digital rights to enable future direct-to-consumer opportunities as well as NFL-related programming on TUBI. In fiscal 2022, FOX Sports acquired U.S. rights to broadcast UEFA international soccer matches, including the 2024 and 2028 UEFA European Football Championships ("Euros"), and launched the United States Football League ("USFL"). FOX Entertainment is investing in more co-production arrangements and owns a stake in all new series that premiered on the FOX Network during the 2021-2022 broadcast season. In addition, the Company's fiscal 2022 acquisitions of MarVista Entertainment and TMZ, including TMZ's iconic website and daily syndicated magazine programs, and the formation of Studio Ramsay Global with Gordon Ramsay will reduce our reliance on third-party content providers for programming 
on our traditional and digital entertainment platforms. We will also continue to invest in content, technology and marketing at TUBI to attract new viewers and retain TUBI's existing audience. In fiscal 2022, TUBI expanded its content library through the premiere of 40 new original titles and the launch of approximately 140 sports, entertainment and local news channels. We believe continuing to provide compelling news, sports and entertainment programming across platforms will increase audience engagement and drive growth across our distribution, affiliate and advertising relationships.
Increase revenue growth through the continued delivery of high quality, premium and valuable content.
With a focused portfolio of assets, we create and produce high quality programming that delivers value for our viewers and our affiliate and advertising partners. We intend to continue to generate appropriate value for our content. Additionally, we expect our enhanced ability to acquire independent programming through co-production arrangements and internal production capabilities will facilitate growth by enabling us to directly manage the economics and programming decisions of our broadcast network and stations group. We also believe our unique ability to deliver "appointment-based" viewing and audiences at scale, along with innovative advertising platforms, delivers substantial value to our advertising customers, and the unique nature of our "appointment-based" content positions us to maintain and even grow audiences during a time of increasing consumer fragmentation.
Expand our digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers, increasing complementary sources of revenues.
Our key networks are offered on all major virtual MVPD services, reflecting the strength of our brands and the "must-have" nature of our content. We are also cultivating and growing direct interactions between FOX brands and consumers outside traditional linear television. For example, TUBI, which we acquired in fiscal 2020, provides us with a wholly-owned digital platform to access a wider digital audience and further the reach of our content. TUBI continues to experience significant growth in total view time across a library of over 45,000 titles, as well as key FOX entertainment, news and sports programming. TUBI streamed over 4 billion hours of content over the course of the fiscal year, a record for the platform, to a young, diverse and loyal audience advertisers are eager to reach. Additionally, FOX Sports has entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership with Flutter Entertainment plc ("Flutter"), which offers FOX Bet Super 6, a national free-to-play game with a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022, and the FOX Bet sportsbook mobile app in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Michigan. We own an equity stake in Flutter and maintain valuable options to acquire approximately 18.5% of FanDuel Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter, and up to 50% of the U.S. business of Flutter subsidiary, The Stars Group. FOX News Media operates a number of high-growth digital businesses, including FOX News Digital, which attracts the highest multiplatform time spent in the news category, along with the FOX Nation SVOD service, which offers U.S. consumers a variety of on-demand content, including original programming from popular opinion hosts. In addition, in October 2021, FOX News Media launched FOX Weather, a free advertising-supported streaming service that offers local, regional and national weather reporting in addition to live programming.

Cable Network Programming Competition
General. Cable network programming is a highly competitive business. Cable networks compete for content, distribution, viewers and advertisers with a variety of media, including broadcast television networks; cable television systems and networks; direct-to-consumer live streaming platforms, SVOD and AVOD services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. Important competitive factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered, the accessibility of such programming, the ability to adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms, quality of user experience and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
FOX News Media. FOX News' primary competition comes from the broadcast networks' national news divisions and cable networks CNN, HLN and MSNBC. FOX Business' primary competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television. FOX News and FOX Business also compete for viewers and advertisers within a broad spectrum of television networks, including other non-news cable networks and free-to-air broadcast television networks. FOX News and FOX Business also face competition online from CNN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, CNBC.com, Bloomberg.com, Yahoo.com and The Wall Street Journal Online, among others.

A number of basic and pay television programming services, such as ESPN and TNT, direct-to-consumer streaming services such as ESPN+, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Peacock, Paramount+ and DAZN, as well as free-to-air stations and broadcast networks, provide programming that also targets FS1, FS2

On a national level, the primary competitors to FS1, FS2, and the Big Ten Network are ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, USA Network, CBS Sports Network, league-owned networks such as NFL Network, NHL Network, NBA TV and MLB Network, and collegiate conference-specific networks such as the SEC Network, Pac-12 Network and ACC Network.

Additionally, MVPDs and online and social media properties such as Amazon, Apple, Yahoo Sports, Facebook and Twitter compete with the Company's cable sports networks by acquiring and distributing sports content to their online users.

FOX Television Stations
FOX Television Stations owns and operates 29 full power broadcast television stations, which deliver broadcast network content, local news and syndicated programming to viewers in 18 local markets. These include stations located in 14 of the top 15 largest DMAs and two stations (referred to as duopolies) in each of 11 DMAs, including the three largest DMAs (New York, Los Angeles and Chicago). In two of the duopoly markets, FOX Television Stations is channel sharing whereby both of its stations in the market operate using a single 6 MHz channel. Of the 29 full power broadcast television stations, 18 stations are affiliated with the FOX Network. These stations leverage viewer, distributor and advertiser demand for the FOX Network's national content. In addition, the FOX Network's strategy to deliver fewer hours of national content than other major broadcasters benefits stations affiliated with the FOX Network, which can utilize the flexibility in scheduling to offer expanded local news and other programming that viewers covet. Our 29 stations collectively produce approximately 1,200 hours of local news coverage every week. For a description of the programming offered to affiliates of the FOX Network, see "—The FOX Network." In addition, FOX Television Stations owns and operates 10 stations broadcasting programming from MyNetworkTV.

(a) | VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 14 through 36. The Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") applies a discount (the "UHF Discount"), which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station's owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station’s RF broadcast channel is considered. In a duopoly market, both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national station ownership cap, see "Government Regulation."

The FOX Network programming ranked #2 among all broadcast network primetime programming for the 2021-2022 broadcast season in the 18 to 49 year old audience (based on Nielsen's commercial+7 ratings). The median age of the FOX Network viewer is 57 years, as compared to 61 years for ABC Television Network ("ABC"), 60 years for NBC and 64 years for CBS. 
•FOX Sports. A significant component of FOX Network programming consists of sports programming, with the FOX Network providing to its affiliates during the 2021-2022 broadcast season live coverage of the NFL, including the premier NFC rights package, America's Game of the Week, the #1 show on television, and Thursday Night Football. The FOX Network also provides live coverage of MLB (including the post-season and the World Series), college football and basketball, the NASCAR Cup Series (including the Daytona 500), MLS and weekly episodes of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. In certain years, FOX Sports broadcasts the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup. In fiscal 2021, FOX Sports entered into an expanded 11-year media rights agreement with the NFL that has extended FOX Sports' coverage of NFC games, created new and exclusive holiday games on the FOX Network, and expanded FOX's digital rights to enable future direct-to-consumer opportunities as well as NFL-related programming on TUBI. 
•FOX Entertainment. FOX Entertainment delivers high-quality scripted, non-scripted and live event content. FOX Network entertainment programming ranked #2 among all broadcast network primetime 
entertainment programming for the 2021-2022 broadcast season in the 18 to 49 year old audience (based on Nielsen's commercial+7 ratings). FOX Entertainment primetime programming during the 2021-2022 broadcast season featured such series as 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Bob's Burgers, Call Me Kat, The Cleaning Lady, The Great North, Family Guy, The Resident, The Simpsons and Welcome to Flatch; unscripted series such as The Masked Singer, Next Level Chef, I Can See Your Voice, MasterChef Junior and Domino Masters; and event specials such as the iHeartRadio Music Awards and the Miss Universe Pageant. In the 2021-2022 broadcast season, FOX launched the #1 new entertainment series Next Level Chef. The Masked Singer was the #2 primetime unscripted entertainment series and 9-1-1 was the #2 broadcast drama in the 18 to 49 year old audience. 9-1-1 and 9-1-1: Lone Star were Monday's top entertainment series of the season. The FOX Network featured four of the broadcast season's top ten comedies: The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers and Call Me Kat. In addition, The Masked Singer, 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star and Next Level Chef placed among the season's top 25 entertainment programs in the 18 to 49 year old audience.
The FOX Network obtains national sports programming through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations, including long-term agreements with the NFL, MLB, college football and basketball conferences, NASCAR, FIFA, UEFA, Concacaf, CONMEBOL and WWE. Entertainment programming is obtained from major television studios, including 20th Television (formerly known as Twentieth Century Fox Television and which is owned by Disney), Sony Pictures Television and Warner Bros. Television, and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms of these agreements generally provide the FOX Network with the right to acquire broadcast rights to a television series for a minimum of four seasons. 
The FOX Network provides programming to affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements require affiliates to the FOX Network to carry the FOX Network programming in all time periods in which the FOX Network programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements. 
The FOX Network also distributes programming through its network-branded website, FOX.com, and its FOX NOW and FOX Sports apps, which offer live streaming of the FOX Network shows and programming from many broadcast stations affiliated with the FOX Network, and licenses programming for distribution through MVPDs' websites and apps.
TUBI
TUBI is a leading AVOD service available on over 25 digital platforms in the United States and select international regions as of June 2022. In fiscal 2022, the service generated over 4 billion hours of total view time (the total number of hours watched) across its content library of over 45,000 films and television programs from over 350 content partners, including every major Hollywood studio. TUBI also features key FOX content, such as The Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice and LEGO Masters, as well as sports programming and live local and national news content. TUBI carries nearly 100 local station feeds (including feeds of FOX's owned and operated stations), covering 50 DMAs and 24 of the top 25 markets. TUBI has also begun to offer new original titles and has introduced linear streaming channels to supplement its on-demand library, including channels featuring FOX Entertainment's The Masked Singer, TMZ and Studio Ramsay Global’s Gordon Ramsay. 
TUBI broadens the reach of network television and enables the Company's advertising partners to access a substantial, incremental digital audience. As of February 2022, the median age of TUBI's viewers was 39 years old, nearly 15 years younger than the median age of viewers of traditional and virtual MVPD services according to the MRI-Simmons March 2022 Cord Evolution Study. TUBI viewers are diverse, with approximately 40% of its audience identifying as multicultural, and over 45% of its audience does not subscribe to traditional or virtual MVPD services.
Entertainment Programming Production
The Company also produces entertainment programming for its traditional and digital entertainment platforms. Fox Alternative Entertainment is a full-service production studio that develops and produces 
unscripted and alternative programming primarily for the FOX Network, including The Masked Singer, Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer and I Can See Your Voice. Bento Box Entertainment develops and produces animated programming, including programming that airs on the FOX Network such as Bob's Burgers and The Great North. In fiscal 2022, the Company acquired the entertainment studio MarVista Entertainment and TMZ, which produces daily syndicated magazine programs, broadcast television specials and other content for distribution on traditional and digital platforms, including TMZ.com, the TMZ mobile app and TUBI. The Company also formed a co-owned production company with Gordon Ramsay, Studio Ramsay Global, that is focused on culinary and lifestyle programming.
MyNetworkTV
The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to its over 180 licensee stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, and is available to approximately 97.5% of U.S. households as of June 30, 2022.
Blockchain Creative Labs
Blockchain Creative Labs, a division formed by FOX Entertainment and Bento Box Entertainment that commenced operations in fiscal 2022, is focused on establishing a leadership position in Web3 content creation, distribution and monetization.
Competition
The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. The FOX Network, MyNetworkTV and TUBI compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with a variety of competing media, including other broadcast television networks, cable television systems and networks; direct-to-consumer live streaming platforms, SVOD and AVOD services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. In addition, the FOX Network and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the U.S. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcast a significantly greater number of hours of programming than the FOX Network and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than the FOX Network. Technological developments are also continuing to affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace.
Each of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media, including direct-to-consumer live streaming platforms, other Internet-delivered platforms such as SVOD and AVOD services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional factors that affect the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite television, services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict.
Other, Corporate and Eliminations
The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations.
FOX Studio Lot
FOX owns the FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California. The historic lot is located on over 50 acres of land and has over 1.85 million square feet of space for both administration and production and post-production services available to service a wide array of industry clients, including 15 sound stages, two broadcast studios, theaters and screening rooms, editing rooms and other television and film production facilities. The FOX Studio Lot provides two primary revenue streams — the lease of a portion of the office space to 21CF and other third parties and the operation of studio facilities for third party productions, which until 2026 will predominantly be Disney productions.
Credible
The Company holds 66% of the equity in Credible, which operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces in the U.S. Credible's offerings provide consumers personalized product and rate options for a range of financial products, including student loans, personal loans, mortgages and insurance policies from multiple consumer lending and insurance providers.
Investments
Flutter
The Company and Flutter have entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the U.S. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game, which has a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022, and the FOX Bet sportsbook mobile app, which is available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Michigan as of June 2022. FOX Sports provides Flutter with an exclusive license to use certain FOX trademarks under a long-term commercial arrangement. In addition, subject to certain conditions and applicable gaming regulatory approvals, FOX Sports has an option until August 2029 to acquire up to 50% of the equity in the U.S. business of The Stars Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter. As part of Flutter's acquisition of The Stars Group in 2020, FOX Sports received the right to acquire an approximately 18.5% equity interest in Flutter's majority-owned subsidiary, FanDuel Group (structured as a 10-year option from 2021), which is currently the subject of ongoing arbitration proceedings. The Company also owns approximately 4.3 million ordinary shares of Flutter, representing approximately 2.5% of Flutter as of June 30, 2022.
Government Regulation
The Communications Act and FCC Regulation
The television broadcast industry in the U.S. is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). The introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations, prospects and financial performance of the Company.
Broadcast Licenses. The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds broadcast licenses in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. FOX Television Stations currently has renewal applications pending for its full power broadcast licenses and will continue filing license renewal applications through calendar year 2023.
Ownership Regulations. Under the FCC's national television ownership rule, one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39% of all U.S. television households, subject to the UHF discount. Under the UHF discount, a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 
50% of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation (including the UHF discount). If the FCC determines in the future to eliminate the UHF discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified, the Company's ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected.
The Company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership. For example, FCC dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC — from being under common ownership or control. In addition, under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation's stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. This ownership limit can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. The FCC could review the Company's compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of FOX Television Stations' license renewal applications. The Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company's Board of Directors to take action to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold, including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder.
Carriage and Content Regulations. FCC regulations require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to require carriage of its signal by traditional MVPDs in the station's market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional MVPDs within its market, which we refer to as retransmission consent. FOX Television Stations have historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations, and the Company has been compensated as a result.
Federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week. In addition, under FCC regulations, television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a "significant purpose," the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. Under FCC rules that were revised in 2019, one of the three hours per week may air on a television's station's multicast stream(s); the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license.
FCC rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Federal law currently authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $445,445 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts. The FCC may impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition. Because indecency complaints are confidential, there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by FOX Television Stations (and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints).
Modifications to the Company's programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of FOX Television Stations and the FOX Network. If indecency regulation is extended to Internet or cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be constitutional, some of the Company's other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels.
The FCC continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification, political advertising, children's television, environmental concerns, emergency alerting and information, equal employment opportunity, technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and 
conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser.
FCC rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming. In addition, Federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 80 largest markets to carry a specified minimum number of hours of primetime or children's programming per calendar quarter with audio descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services.
FCC regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations, including, among other things, a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.
Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines.
Broadcast Transmission Standard. In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the "Next Generation" broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also referred to as "ATSC 3.0." FOX Television Stations is actively building out ATSC 3.0 facilities. FOX Television Stations is participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the Company's operations. In June 2020, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to non-video services. In June 2022, the FCC issued a Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and roll-out of both video and non-video ATSC 3.0 services, as well as the broadcast requirements for the ATSC 1.0 standard.
Privacy and Information Regulation
The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company's digital businesses. Federal and state laws and regulations affecting the Company's online services, websites, and other business activities include: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent; the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or "spam"; the Video Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a "video tape service provider;" the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which restricts certain marketing communications, such as text messages and calls, without explicit consent; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the collection, handling, disclosure, and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services, imposes notice obligations, and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information; and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA"), which imposes broad obligations on the collection, use, handling and disclosure of personal information of California residents. For example, subject to certain exceptions, the CCPA provides individual rights for Californians, including to access, delete, and to restrict the "sale" of personal information.
A number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at the state and federal level, which would impose additional obligations on businesses, including in connection with targeted advertising. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), which amends the CCPA, was passed in November 2020 and generally takes effect on January 1, 2023. Among other things, the CPRA creates a new state privacy protection agency, expands individual rights, and introduces new requirements for businesses, several which are subject to additional rulemaking. Other states have passed or introduced similar privacy legislation, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut. In addition, the FTC and state attorneys 
general and other regulators have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus. Other federal and state laws and regulations also may be adopted that impact our digital services, including those relating to oversight of user-generated content.
Foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations, which apply to certain of the Company's operations. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, in particular, regulates the collection, use and security of personal data and restricts the trans-border flow of such data. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, China, and Mexico, also have enacted data protection legislation.
The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs. These laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change, and could result in increased compliance costs, claims, financial penalties for noncompliance, changes to business practices, including with respect to tailored advertising, or otherwise impact the Company's business. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties, private litigation, require us to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address, and harm our reputation, even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation.
Consumer Finance Laws and Regulations
Credible operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces that market and provide services in heavily regulated industries across the United States. As a result, Credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. These include the laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following:
•the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or "RESPA," and similar state laws, and federal and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or "UDAAP," laws and regulations, which place restrictions on the manner in which consumer loans and insurance products are marketed and originated and the amount and nature of fees that may be charged or paid to Credible by lenders, insurance carriers and real estate professionals for providing or obtaining consumer loan and insurance requests;
•the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things, imposes requirements related to mortgage disclosures; and
•federal and state licensing laws, such as the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or "SAFE Act," which establishes minimum standards for the licensing and regulation of mortgage loan originators, and state insurance licensing laws.
Intellectual Property
The Company's intellectual property assets include copyrights in television programming and other publications, websites and technologies; trademarks, trade dress, service marks, logos, slogans, sound marks, design rights, symbols, characters, names, titles and trade names, domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, trade secrets and know how; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the production, distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to domestic and international cable and satellite television services, video-on-demand services, operation of websites, and through the sale of products, such as collectible merchandise, apparel, books and publications, among others.
The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property, relying upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. There can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company's intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of 
approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company's intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Even if not valid, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations.
Human Capital Resources
Our workforce is the creative, strategic and operational engine of FOX's success. We have taken extraordinary actions to care for our employees during COVID-19, and our commitment to grow and support our employees continues on an ongoing and sustained basis as we move forward. We aim to develop our human capital by recruiting a talented and diverse workforce, offering competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a healthy work-life balance, providing learning and development opportunities for growth, protecting health and safety, fostering workplace civility and inclusion and encouraging our employees to have an impact in their communities.
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 10,600 full-time employees. In the ordinary course of our business and consistent with industry practice, we also employ freelance and temporary workers who provide important production and broadcast support services. The vast majority of our workforce is based in the United States, and a portion is unionized. We have posted on our corporate website our Employment Information Report (EEO-1), showing the race, ethnicity and gender of our U.S. employees. https://www.foxcorporation.com/eeo-1-data.
FOX's Corporate Social Responsibility Report, also posted on our website at www.foxcorporation.com/, provides a detailed review of our human capital programs and achievements. Our key human capital initiatives include:
Recruitment and Diversity
We are committed to diversity from the very top of the Company. Our Board of Directors requires that minority and female candidates are presented for consideration with each Director vacancy. We believe that the more voices in the room and the more diverse the experiences of our colleagues, the better FOX's internal culture and external programming are. Our diversity enables us to be more reflective of the audiences we reach and enhances our ability to create news, sports, and entertainment programming that serves all viewers across the country. An inclusive and diverse workplace is not merely a strategy or business objective; it is fundamentally woven in the fabric of the Company. This commitment begins with our approach to talent recruitment across all of our disciplines and extends to the way we nurture and advance our colleagues' careers.
FOX lists job openings internally and externally because we believe this is one of the best tools to reach the widest and most diverse pool of candidates. We also collaborate with an array of professional organizations that offer FOX access to talent at recruiting events and conventions. These organizations include:
•ADCOLOR
•Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA)
•National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)
•National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ)
•Native American Journalists Association (NAJA)
•NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ Journalists
•Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA)
We also offer paid internships to build a diverse pipeline of early-career talent and emerging leaders. The FOX Internship Program offers students an exciting opportunity to gain practical experience, participating in real-world projects and seminars on the media industry, technology and professional development. This internship program, which runs for 8-10 weeks three times per year, welcomed over 380 students in calendar year 2021 and was listed on Vault's 2022 "100 Best Internships." We also partner with the Emma Bowen Foundation, the T. Howard Foundation, the International Television and Radio Society, Sports Biz CARES and the Entertainment Industry College Outreach Program to provide media internships for promising students.
In addition, FOX has developed and implemented a number of internal training programs designed to provide outstanding individuals with workforce skills and professional development opportunities. These programs build the pipeline of our next generation of leaders, many of whom are from underrepresented backgrounds. Examples include:
•FOX Ad Sales Training ("FAST"): Initiated in 2021, this rotational program aims to attract, develop, and retain early career talent. Through exposure to various functions within Ad Sales, FAST develops professional skills of promising individuals recruited from outside FOX.
•FOX Alternative Entertainment ("FAE") FASTRACK: This highly selective accelerated producers' initiative is designed to nurture producers with diverse backgrounds and life experiences, and create a pipeline for new, behind-the-camera talent on FAE series. Launched in 2020, the program places candidates as associate producers on production teams across various FAE-produced shows to provide valuable exposure to many facets of production.
•FOX News Media Digital Rotational Program: Launched in 2021, this program strives to identify high potential talent from diverse backgrounds with a passion for the FOX News Media brand. The goal is to find staff placement for the individuals who complete the one-year rotational program across three key departments for four months each and have proven themselves to be integral members of the FOX News Media Digital team.
•FOX News Multimedia Reporters Training Program: This program places talent from diverse backgrounds in multimedia reporter roles across the country, where they shoot, report, edit and produce their own high-end content across FOX News platforms. Through daily guidance and feedback from management, we challenge and enable the talent to continually hone their journalistic skills.
•FOX Sports Professional Development Program: This program prepares production team leaders with skills for the unique sports production environment, such as communication and influence in the control room under short deadlines. 
•FOX Television Stations Sales Training Program: This program was created to develop and mentor the next generation of diverse, motivated sales professionals for FOX Television Stations. Trainees participate in both intensive classroom study of all aspects of the television station advertising sales business and shadowing of FOX Television Stations sales account executives.
•FOX Writers Incubator Initiative: This FOX Entertainment program, which welcomed its first class in March 2022, nurtures and trains talented writers with diverse voices, backgrounds and life experiences. Writers work intensively on their scripts with the support of established writers, executives, directors and producers across all genres (comedy, drama, animation, etc.).
Employee Compensation and Benefits
We are proud to invest in our people through competitive pay and comprehensive benefits designed to attract, motivate and retain our talent. Providing equal pay for equal work, without regard to race, gender or other protected characteristics, is an imperative at FOX. We link our more senior employees' pay to corporate performance through discretionary annual incentive compensation awards. 
FOX also provides generous benefits that support the health, wellness and financial stability of our employees and their families. Full-time employees are eligible for medical insurance through a choice of several plans, in which employees also may enroll family members, including domestic partners (same-sex and opposite-sex). Freelance employees who work a minimum number of hours are also eligible for a medical plan. Many employees enjoy the convenience of covered telemedicine visits. In addition, we provide vision and dental insurance, which includes coverage for adult orthodontic care. Our coverage is generous, with employee 
contributions and costs more favorable than national averages according to a 2021 Mercer LLC survey. Eligible employees may participate in flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts and qualified transportation expense accounts. We also provide employees with a health advocate service, with experts who support employees and their eligible family members in navigating a wide range of health and insurance-related issues. In addition, we have onsite fitness centers in our New York and Los Angeles worksites. To provide additional support during COVID-19, we paid our full-time employees' medical insurance premiums from March 2020 through December 2021.
Full-time employees are eligible to receive paid holidays, paid floating holidays, paid vacation, paid sick and safe time, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, full salary replacement for up to 26 weeks of short-term disability, basic long-term disability insurance, adoption and surrogacy reimbursement, charitable gift matching, cybersecurity and malware protection for personal devices and an employee assistance program that offers onsite counseling in New York and Los Angeles, as well as smoking cessation and weight management programs. The FOX 401(k) Savings Plan provides employees with a company contribution, and it offers a company match, Roth and post-tax contribution options and catch-up contributions. Finally, FOX also offers employees group discounts in various voluntary benefits such as critical illness insurance, group universal life insurance, auto and home insurance, legal insurance, pet insurance, supplemental long-term disability insurance and student loan refinancing.
Work-Life Balance and Workplace Flexibility
We believe offering our employees the tools necessary for a healthy work-life balance empowers them to thrive in our modern workforce. To that end, FOX allows eligible individuals the opportunity to work on a partially remote (i.e., "hybrid") or fully remote basis in appropriate circumstances. We support these working arrangements by deploying online collaboration tools, offering e-learning courses on effective remote work, providing reasonable office supplies and reimbursing business expenses. The Company also reimburses employees who work on a fully remote basis with a monthly stipend for business expenses (including mobile or other devices, Internet and electricity). Where appropriate, we provide technology and mobile communication devices, tailored to employee duties. 
Our parental leave policy allows eligible new parents to bond with their children for a substantial period with full pay, and our workplaces have lactation rooms for our new mothers. We provide onsite subsidized childcare to full-time employees at the Los Angeles FOX Child Care Center. In addition, we offer backup child, adult, elder and return-to-work care. For calendar years 2021 and 2022, we doubled the number of days that employees may use the backup care service from 20 to 40 days per year, and we also allow employees to use their backup care benefits for virtual tutoring.
Learning and Development
FOX offers employees multiple learning and development programs, including tuition reimbursement, management and leadership development, online and on-demand e-learning, live webinars and assessment tools. Our annual MentorMatch program provides junior employees with the tools and resources to grow their careers through relationship-building and networking. We also identify key individuals for ongoing talent management, retention and succession planning. Within FOX News Media and FOX Television Stations, we deliver specialized training on the First Amendment, defamation, privacy, infringement and other newsgathering and reporting topics to educate employees on these principles and provide advice on best practices.
Health and Safety
FOX is committed to protecting the health, safety and working environment of our employees, clients and neighbors. Our Environmental Health and Safety ("EHS") Management Program manages risks by implementing proactive, practical and feasible controls into daily work activities. FOX's EHS program works to continuously improve its performance through preventive measures, correcting hazards or dangerous conditions and minimizing the environmental impact of our activities. The FOX Global Security team oversees the Company's security and emergency response efforts. The team proactively monitors, reports and responds to potential and actual threats to people, physical assets, property, productions and events using a number of 
tools, including advanced technology, active training programs and risk assessment and management processes.
Workplace Civility and Inclusion
Trust begins in the workplace every single day. We are committed to fostering a working environment of trust for our colleagues, in which people do their best work. Harassment, discrimination, retaliation and threats to health and safety all undermine our working environment of trust and make it harder for people to excel. Therefore, it is our policy to provide a safe work environment free from this or any other unlawful conduct.
Creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination and harassment begins at the highest leadership level of the Company and is embedded throughout our policies and practices. The FOX Standards of Business Conduct and the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, which are posted on our website, create our framework for addressing complaints and taking remedial measures as needed. These policies offer multiple complaint channels, including a third-party managed hotline that allows for anonymous reporting of concerns. In addition, all new hires must complete training on the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, as well as compliance and business ethics, and existing employees must complete the training periodically.
FOX also facilitates nine Employee Resource Groups, which are formed around shared identity, interests or pursuits for the purpose of advancing careers, forming a more inclusive workplace community and fostering a sense of belonging:
•ABLE -- promotes an inclusive environment and culture for our colleagues with disabilities through advocacy and allyship
•ACE (Asian Community Exchange) -- serves Asian Americans at FOX by advancing our members, championing our stories and empowering our communities
•BLK+ -- celebrates our Black colleagues and seeks to build community through programming and professional development while standing in solidarity with our allies
•HOLA (Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Advancement) -- develops Hispanic leaders, enriches FOX's diverse culture and drives positive impact
•PRIDE -- cultivates community among FOX's LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, supports causes important to the LGBTQ+ community and fosters a work environment where all colleagues feel 100% authentic and professionally supported
•VETS -- is committed to the community of veterans, current service members, military supporters and military spouses employed at FOX by embracing our four core values – Community, Appreciation, Connection & Education
•WiT (Women in Tech) -- attracts, advances and empowers women technologists and amplifies their impact at FOX
•Women of FOX Sports -- connects, inspires, informs and gives back to the community, with the goal of furthering women's collective contributions and advancement within the sports industry
•WOMEN@FOX -- is committed to developing female leadership at all levels and fostering a culture where all women thrive
Maintaining a work environment where employees can thrive, advance and feel included is one of our top priorities at FOX. To that end, FOX developed and launched BE INCLUDED, a toolkit-building series of learning modules and open forum discussions to enable employees to create deeper workplace connections and support colleagues in cultivating an inclusive workplace.
As a result of these and other efforts, many outside organizations have recognized FOX for our deep commitment to inclusion and diversity. For example:
•DiversityComm once again recognized FOX as a Top Employer and as a Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Company for 2022
•FOX was appointed to the Military Friendly® Employer list again for 2022 and named one of its 2022 top ten employers
•FOX was named to Disability Equality Index's "Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion" list again for 2022
•Black EOE Journal, HISPANIC Network Magazine, Professional WOMAN's Magazine and U.S. Veterans Magazine have all listed FOX as a 2022 top employer
Community Impact
FOX employees are deeply engaged in their communities. Nowhere is that more evident than through the commitment and involvement of our colleagues who volunteer their time, share their talents and contribute to worthy causes through our philanthropic platform, FOX Forward. Through volunteer opportunities and service projects, FOX employees support community groups, veterans services organizations, local schools and families in need, and we encourage our colleagues to donate their time and resources to change-making organizations. Over the course of fiscal 2022, across all FOX businesses, our giving programs generated over $8 million in impact to local communities. 
Among this year's initiatives, FOX and its employees across the Company supported military veterans, first responders and their families by partnering with U.S. VETS to champion their Make Camo Your Cause campaign, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation's Hidden Heroes campaign. FOX continued to serve as an Annual Disaster Giving Program partner for the American Red Cross, while also making two additional donations of $1 million each to the Southern and Midwest Tornadoes Campaign and humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. 
FOX also sponsored the Los Angeles Food Bank's Backpack Program for underserved students experiencing food insecurity, while supplementing the arts and media education at twelve local Los Angeles public schools through the FOX for Students program. In December 2021 alone, the FOX Forward Holiday giving program raised over $450,000 to lift up our local community members during an especially difficult year. 
As part of the Company's commitment to give back to the communities in which its employees live and work, our FOX Giving program matches contributions made by regular full-time employees to eligible non-profit organizations, dollar for dollar, up to a total of $1,000 per fiscal year when submitted through the FOX Giving portal, Benevity. We also track and reward employee volunteer hours with the opportunity to earn up to $1,000 per year that employees may direct to charities through the program. Over the course of the fiscal year, across all FOX businesses, contributions through our FOX Giving program exceeded $1.5 million. 
Additionally, FOX provides invaluable in-kind support through public service announcements and editorial coverage of causes such as Building Homes for Heroes, Los Angeles County High School for the Arts Foundation, The Emma Bowen Foundation and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, while also creating additional impact in our communities through efforts such as FOX Sports Supports, FOX Entertainment's #TVForAll, FOX Television Stations' Holiday Community Giving Campaigns and FOX News Media's support of Answer the Call, the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.
