---------+----------

Our Company 
 Vantage Drilling International (the “Company” or “VDI”), a Cayman Islands exempted company, is an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers. Through our fleet of drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused on international markets. Additionally, for drilling units owned by others, we provide construction supervision services while under construction, preservation management services when stacked and operations and marketing services for operating rigs.
Restructuring Agreement and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceeding
 On December 1, 2015, we and Vantage Drilling Company (“VDC”), our former parent company, entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Agreement”) with a majority of our secured creditors. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company agreed to pursue a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Reorganization Plan”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and VDC agreed to commence official liquidation proceedings under the laws of the Cayman Islands. On December 2, 2015, pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company acquired two subsidiaries responsible for the management of the Company from VDC in exchange for a $61.5 million promissory note (the “VDC Note”). As this transaction involved a reorganization of entities under common control, it was reflected in the consolidated financial statements, at carryover basis, on a retrospective basis. Effective as of the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on February 10, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), VDC’s former equity interest in the Company was cancelled. Immediately following that event, the VDC Note was converted into 655,094 new ordinary shares of the reorganized Company (the “New Shares”) in accordance with the terms thereof, in satisfaction of the obligation thereunder, which, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $62.6 million as of such date.
 On December 3, 2015 (the “Petition Date”), the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and certain VDC subsidiaries who were guarantors of the Company’s pre-bankruptcy secured debt, filed the Reorganization Plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (In re Vantage Drilling International (F/K/A Offshore Group Investment Limited), et al., Case No. 15-12422). On January 15, 2016, the District Court of Delaware confirmed the Company’s pre-packaged Reorganization Plan and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Plan, the pre-bankruptcy term loans and senior notes were retired on the Effective Date by issuing to the debtholders 4,344,959 units in the reorganized Company (the “Units”). Each Unit of securities originally consisted of one New Share and $172.61 of principal of the Company’s 1%/12% Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes due 2030 (the “Convertible Notes”), subject to adjustment upon the payment of interest in kind (“PIK interest”) and certain cases of redemption or conversion of the Convertible Notes, as well as share splits, share dividends, consolidation or reclassification of the New Shares. The New Shares and the Convertible Notes are subject to the terms of an agreement that prohibits the New Shares and Convertible Notes from being traded separately.
 The Convertible Notes are convertible into New Shares in certain circumstances, at a conversion price (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes) which was $95.60 as of the issue date. The Indenture for the Convertible Notes includes customary covenants that restrict, among other things, the granting of liens and customary events of default, including among other things, failure to issue securities upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2017, taking into account the payment of PIK interest on the Convertible Notes to such date, each such Unit consisted of one New Share and $175.90 of principal of Convertible Notes.
 Other significant elements of the Reorganization Plan included:
 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company’s pre-petition credit agreement was amended and restated (the “Credit Agreement”) to (i) replace the $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment under its pre-petition facility with a new $32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility and (ii) repay the $150 million of outstanding borrowings with (a) $7.0 million of cash and (b) the issuance of $143.0 million initial term loans (the “2016 Term Loan Facility”).
 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Holders of the Company’s pre-petition  term loans and senior notes claims were eligible to participate in a rights offering conducted by the Company for $75.0 million of the Company’s new 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the “10% Second Lien Notes”). In connection with this rights offering, certain creditors entered into a “backstop” agreement to purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer was not fully subscribed. The premium paid to such creditors under the backstop agreement was approximately $2.2 million, which was paid $1.1 million in cash and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second Lien Notes, resulting in a total issued amount of $76.1 million of 10% Second Lien Notes and net cash proceeds to the Company of $73.9 million, after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium.

The Reorganization Plan allowed the Company to continue business operations during the court proceedings and maintain all operating assets and agreements. The Company had adequate liquidity prior to the filing and did not have to seek any debtor-in-possession financing. All trade payables, credits, wages and other related obligations were unimpaired by the Reorganization Plan.
 Drilling  
 Jackups 
 A jackup rig is a mobile, self-elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support, at which point the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations. All of our premium jackup rigs were built at PPL Shipyard in Singapore. The design of our premium jackup rigs is the Baker Marine Pacific Class 375. These units are ultra-premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to 375 feet of water, a cantilever drilling floor and a total drilling depth capacity of approximately 30,000 feet. Additionally, during part of 2017 our fleet included a class 154-44C standard jackup rig, the Vantage 260.Drillships 
 Drillships are self-propelled and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity. All of our drillships are dynamically positioned and designed for drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet, with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to 40,000 feet. The drillships’ hull design has a variable deck load of approximately 20,000 tons and measures approximately 781 feet long by 137 feet wide. All of our drillships were built at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. 
 The following table sets forth certain information concerning our offshore drilling fleet as of February 28, 2018.

Recent Developments and Subsequent Events
 In April 2017, we purchased the Vantage 260, a class 154-44C jackup rig, and related multi-year drilling contract. In August 2017, we substituted the Sapphire Driller, a Baker Marine Pacific Class 375 jack-up rig, to fulfill the drilling contract. On October 19, 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Vantage 260. The transaction closed and the Vantage 260 was sold on February 26, 2018.
 Since July 2015, the Company has been cooperating in an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC arising from allegations that Hamylton Padilha, the Brazilian agent VDC used in the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), and Mr. Hsin-Chi Su, a former member of the Board of Directors and a significant shareholder of our former parent company, VDC, had engaged in an alleged scheme to pay bribes to former Petrobras executives, in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). In August 2017, we received a letter from the DOJ acknowledging our full cooperation in the DOJ’s investigation and closing the investigation without any action against the Company.  We have continued our cooperation in the investigation by the SEC into the same allegations and have engaged in negotiations with the staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC to resolve this investigation.  The Company has reached an agreement in principle with the staff relating to terms of a proposed offer of settlement, which is being presented to the Commission for approval.  While there can be no assurance that the proposed offer of settlement will be accepted by the Commission, the Company believes the proposed resolution will become final in the second quarter of 2018.  In connection with the proposed offer of settlement, we have accrued a liability in the amount of $5 million.  If the Commission does not accept the offer of settlement and the SEC determines that violations of the FCPA have occurred, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, as well as additional requirements or changes to our business practices and compliance programs, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  For more information about this matter, along with information regarding certain other legal proceedings involving the Company, please see “Item 3-Legal Proceedings.”

During the fourth quarter 2017 our ultra-deepwater drillship the Platinum Explorer commenced its three year contract with ONGC in India.
On January 17, 2018, we announced that our premium jack-up rig, the Aquamarine Driller received a letter of award for a new 18 month contract with Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Company Sdn. Bhd. (“CPOC”).
 On January 31, 2018, we announced that our premium jack-up rig, the Topaz Driller entered into a 150 day contract with a customer in West Africa.
 Strengths 
 We believe our primary competitive strengths include the following: 
 Premium fleet. Our fleet is currently comprised of seven ultra-premium high specification drilling units: four jackup rigs and three drillships. We believe the Emerald Driller, Sapphire Driller, Aquamarine Driller and Topaz Driller are ultra-premium jackup rigs due to their ability to drill in deeper depths, as well as their enhanced operational efficiency and technical capabilities when compared to a majority of the current global jackup rig fleet, which is primarily comprised of older, smaller and less capable rigs using less modern technology. The Platinum Explorer, Titanium Explorer and Tungsten Explorer are ultra-deepwater drillships that are designed to drill in up to 12,000 feet of water. The Titanium Explorer and Tungsten Explorer are further upgraded to have a hook load of 2.5 million pounds, which further enhances their capabilities to drill deep and complex wells in up to 12,000 feet of water. Our drillships are currently equipped to drill in water depths of up to 10,000 feet. We believe 10,000 feet to be the upper-limit water depth currently being developed by leading offshore exploration and production companies, though we also believe that they are evaluating future deepwater development projects in water depths in excess of 10,000 feet.    
 Proven safety and operational track record. We have a proven track record of safely and successfully operating, marketing, managing and constructing offshore drilling units.
 Experienced and customer focused management and operational team. We benefit from our management team, which has extensive experience in the drilling industry, strong relationships with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies and international and domestic public company experience involving numerous acquisitions and debt and equity financings. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy includes: 
 Maintain a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity. In response to the significant downturn in the drilling industry, we are strategically preserving our liquidity. Completing the Reorganization Plan significantly reduced our debt service obligations and we have no significant maturities until December 2019. We are working to optimize our workforce for our current level of operations, closely monitoring maintenance and capital expenditures and working to extend our contract backlog. 
 Capitalize on customer demand for modern, high specification units. We own and manage high specification drilling units, which are well suited to meet the requirements of customers for efficiently drilling through deep and complex geological formations, and drilling horizontally. Additionally, high specification drilling units generally provide faster drilling and moving times. A majority of the bid invitations for jackups that we receive require high specification units. Aside from their drilling capabilities, we believe that customers generally prefer modern drilling units because of improved safety features and less frequent downtime for maintenance. Modern drilling units are also generally preferred by crews, which makes it easier to hire and retain high quality operating personnel.
 Expand key industry relationships. We are focused on expanding relationships with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused on international markets, which we believe will allow us to obtain longer-term contracts to build our backlog of business when dayrates and operating margins justify entering into such contracts. We believe that our existing relationships with these companies have contributed to our historically strong contract backlog. Longer-term contracts increase revenue visibility and mitigate some of the volatility in cash flows caused by cyclical market downturns. 
 Maintain a balance of deepwater and jackup exposure. We believe our customers will continue an emphasis on exploration in both deep and shallow waters due, in part, to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost-effective. We believe that the water-depth capability of our ultra-deepwater drilling units is attractive to our customers and allows us to compete effectively in obtaining long-term deepwater drilling contracts. We believe our modern fleet of high specification jackups when operated efficiently also allows us to bid effectively in obtaining contracts. 
 We may seek to manage additional deepwater drilling units and jackup drilling units to service the market.
 Our Industry 
 The offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling, workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling units. Historically, the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand, excess 
 5

rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time as is the case today. As is common throughout the oilfield services industry, offshore drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas. Sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and, as a result, greater demand for our services. As a result of the persistence of reduced oil and gas prices since late 2014, reduced demand for offshore drilling rigs by our customers has continued. The reduced demand is occurring at the same time that drilling rigs continue to be brought into the market or scheduled for delivery resulting in an oversupply of equipment. We expect that these adverse market conditions are likely to continue for the duration of 2018 and potentially beyond.  
 Offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another. The cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions. However, significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long-term because of rig mobility. 
 The offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water (<400 ft.), midwater (>400 ft.), deepwater (>4,000 ft.) and ultra-deepwater (>7,500 ft.). The global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups. 
 Our jackup fleet is focused on the “long-legged” (350+ ft.) high specification market. The drillships that we operate are focused on the ultra-deepwater segment, but can operate efficiently and cost effectively in the midwater and deepwater markets as well. 
 Customers 
 Our customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies, government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 and for the periods from January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016 and from February 10, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the following customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue:

 Drilling Contracts 
 Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiation with our customers, and most contracts are awarded through competitive bidding against other contractors. Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control. Currently all of our drilling contracts are on a dayrate basis. A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term. Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination fee. Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extensive downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events or for convenience by the customer. Many of these events are beyond our control. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term. Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the client to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our clients may seek to renegotiate drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension. If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if 
 6

contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The following table sets forth certain information concerning the current contract status of our offshore drilling fleet as of February 28, 2018. 
 
Name | Region | ContractEnd Date | Customer 
-------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------------------------
Emerald Driller | Middle East | Q2 2020 | Total E&P Qatar 
Sapphire Driller | West Africa | Q2 2019 | ENI Congo SA 
Aquamarine Driller | Southeast Asia | Q3 2019 | CPOC through Olio Energy Sdn Bhd

Platinum Explorer | India | Q4 2020 | Oil & Natural Gas Corporation 
Tungsten Explorer | West Africa | Q4 2018 | Total E&P Congo 

Contract Backlog
 As of December 31, 2017, our owned fleet had total drilling contract backlog of approximately $282.1 million. We expect that approximately $177.4 million of our total contract backlog will be performed during 2018, with the remainder performed in subsequent years.
Competition 
 The contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors, including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas. In addition, demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control, including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non-OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Pricing (day rate) is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, capabilities, age and each contractor’s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Operators also may consider crew experience, rig location and efficiency. We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively in a low price environment, build new rigs or acquire existing rigs. In the current market, contractors that are awarded a job are more often the ones that submit proposals for contracts at very low day rates thereby depressing global pricing.
 Our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller, locally owned companies. Competition for rigs is usually on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that is sometimes substantial, from one region to another in response to demand. 
 Operating Hazards 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the offshore drilling business, including, but not limited to: blowouts, craterings, fires, explosions, equipment failures, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. 
 These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of drilling operations, or damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Generally, we seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our customers for some of these risks. To the extent not transferred to customers by contract, we seek protection against some of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on our rigs and drilling equipment, protection and indemnity, commercial general liability, which has coverage extension for underground resources and equipment coverage, commercial contract indemnity and commercial umbrella insurance. 
 There are risks that are outside of our control. Nonetheless, we believe that we are adequately insured for liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters, extensive fire damage or damage to the environment. For more, see “Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses.” 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage, third party liability, employer’s liability, war risk, general liability, vessel pollution and other coverage. However, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. 
 7

Our primary marine package provides for hull and machinery coverage for our drilling units up to a scheduled value for each asset, which we believe approximates replacement cost. The maximum coverage for our seven drilling units is $1.4 billion. The policies are subject to certain exclusions, limitations, deductibles and other conditions. Deductibles for physical damage to our jackup rigs and our drillships are $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, per occurrence. Our protection and indemnity policy provides liability coverage limits of $500 million per rig. In addition to these policies, we have separate policies providing coverage for onshore general liability, employer’s liability, auto liability and non-owned aircraft liability, with customary coverage, limits and deductibles. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 Our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to, and affected in varying degrees by, governmental laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws, regulations and duties relating to the importation and exportation of and operation of drilling units and other equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, environmental protection, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Furthermore, these regulations have limited the opportunities for international drilling contracts to participate in tenders for contracts or to perform services in certain countries as the governments have strongly favored local service providers. Operations in less developed countries may be subject to legal systems that are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. 
 The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations.  Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.  The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing.  These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations.  Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes.  Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.
 Environmental Regulation 
 For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation on our current operations, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages.” We anticipate that we will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. To date, we have not expended material amounts beyond those amounts spent on our basic rig designs in order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures. 
 We have historically conducted work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and may conduct such work in the future. Although we are not currently conducting any operations under the jurisdiction of U.S. environmental and natural resource agencies, similar restrictions and concerns apply in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. These requirements and concerns may be more or less stringent than those associated with the following U.S. laws.
 Heightened environmental concerns have in many locations, led to greater and more stringent environmental regulation, higher drilling costs, and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process. Requirements applicable to our operations include regulations that would require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the environment, require removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Environmental requirements include water quality laws, regulations and policies that prohibit and/or regulate the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, into the waters. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters. Violations of monitoring, reporting, permitting and other requirements can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Laws governing air emissions and solid and hazardous waste also apply to our operations.
 8

A variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security have been adopted in certain jurisdictions where we operate.  For example, these initiatives may require the development of vessel security plans and on-board installation of automatic information systems, or AIS, to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications. 
 The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international conventions negotiated by the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions. 
 Annex VI to MARPOL sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling units, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this purpose, gross tonnage is based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the vessel. The United States has ratified Annex VI. In addition, any drilling units we operate internationally are subject to the requirements of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its provisions. We believe the drilling units we currently offer for international projects comply with Annex VI, but changes to our equipment and ratifying countries’ regulatory interpretations of the Annex VI requirements could impose additional costs on us, which could be significant. 
 Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially adversely affected our earnings or competitive position. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to which we are subject. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2017, we managed a workforce of approximately 930 people, of which approximately 440 were our direct employees.
