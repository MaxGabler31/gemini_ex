Item 1. Business.
Overview
Edgewell Personal Care Company, and its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of personal care products in the wet shave, sun and skin care, and feminine care categories. With operations in over 20 countries, our products are widely available in more than 50 countries. 
History and Development
We were incorporated in the state of Missouri on September 23, 1999 and, prior to April 2000, were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ralston Purina Company. On April 1, 2000, all of the outstanding shares of our common stock were distributed to shareholders of Ralston Purina Company and we became an independent publicly-owned company. During the years that followed, we implemented a strategy of acquiring several personal care brands, which created the foundation for the company we are today.
In 2003, we completed the acquisition of the Schick-Wilkinson Sword business (“SWS”) from Pfizer, Inc., which was the second largest manufacturer and marketer of men’s and women’s wet shave products in the world. Our portfolio of wet shave products includes: Hydro® and Quattro® men’s shaving systems; Hydro Silk®, Quattro for Women®, Intuition® and Silk Effects® Plus women’s shaving systems; and the Hydro, Quattro, Xtreme 3®, Slim Twin®, Slim Triple®, Skintimate and Extra3™ disposables. SWS has over 100 years of history in the shaving products industry with a reputation for high quality and innovation in shaving technology. SWS products are sold throughout the world. 
In 2007, we acquired Playtex Products, Inc. (“Playtex”), a leading manufacturer and marketer of well-recognized brands such as Playtex® feminine care products, Wet Ones® pre-moistened wipes, and Banana Boat® and Hawaiian Tropic® sun care products, thereby expanding our branded consumer products portfolio. 
In 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Edge® and Skintimate® shave preparation brands from S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., adding market leading United States (“U.S.”) shave preparation brands to our existing wet shave product portfolio. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of American Safety Razor, LLC (“ASR”), a leading global manufacturer of private label and value wet shaving razors and blades and specialty blades. 
Strengthening our company’s feminine care product portfolio, in 2013 we acquired the Stayfree® pad, Carefree® liner and o.b.® tampon feminine hygiene brands in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean from Johnson & Johnson.
In 2015, we completed the separation of our Household Products business, which manufactures and markets batteries and portable lighting, into a separate publicly-owned company (the “Spin” or the “Separation”). We completed the tax-free Separation by distributing 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Energizer SpinCo, Inc. to our shareholders. The newly formed company assumed the name Energizer Holdings, Inc. (“New Energizer”) and began trading under the symbol “ENR” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Edgewell retained the Personal Care business and trades on the NYSE under the symbol “EPC.” Following the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of New Energizer. In connection with the Separation, we changed our name to Edgewell Personal Care Company on June 30, 2015.
In recent years, we have entered the men’s grooming and skin care markets through several acquisitions. On October 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited (“Bulldog”), a men’s grooming and skincare company based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, L.L.C. (“Jack Black”), a men’s luxury skincare company based in the U.S. On September 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cremo Holding Company, LLC (“Cremo”), one of the strongest and fastest growing masstige men’s grooming brands, offering a complete line of beard, hair, body wash, shave prep and skin care products. These more recent acquisitions have created opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio into the growing, global grooming category, and have allowed us to leverage our international geographic footprint.
On November 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Billie, strengthening our women’s Wet Shave product portfolio. Billie is a fast growing, digitally native, omni-channel brand focused on providing women with high-quality shaving and premium body care products.
Our Business Segments and Product Strategies
We manage our business in three operating segments: Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives and other items that are not representative of management’s view on how segment performance is evaluated. Information regarding the product portfolios of these segments is included within the following discussion. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, as well as other geographical information, is included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Wet Shave
Wet Shave products are sold under the Schick®, Wilkinson Sword®, Edge, Skintimate®, Billie®, Shave Guard and Personna® brand names. We manufacture and distribute Schick and Wilkinson Sword razor systems, composed of razor handles and refillable blades, and disposable shave products for men and women. While we market our wet shave products throughout the world, our primary markets are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. We believe we hold the number two global market share position in wet shaving. The category is highly competitive, with brands vying for consumer loyalty and retail shelf space. 
In 2022, we completed the acquisition of Billie, adding the growing woman’s brand to our portfolio of products. Billie’s strong direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities have underpinned its strong growth, which positioned the brand well for its initial expansion into U.S. brick-and-mortar in 2022. The Billie brand complements and strengthens Edgewell’s position in the women’s shaving category, adding to our portfolio of strong brands such as Schick Intuition, Hydro Silk and Skintimate. 
In the U.S., Canada and Japan, we sell market-leading shave preparation products, including shaving gels and creams under the Edge, Skintimate and Shave Guard brands.
We also manufacture, distribute and sell a complete line of private label and disposable razors, shaving systems and replacement blades. These private label wet shave products including emerging direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) brands are sold primarily under a retailer’s store name or under our value brand names such as Personna.
Sun and Skin Care
Sun and Skin Care products are sold under the Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog®, Jack Black®, Cremo® and Wet Ones brand names. We market Sun Care products under the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic brands and believe these brands, on a combined basis, hold a leading market share position in the U.S. sun care category. We compete across the full spectrum of Sun Care categories: general protection, sport, kids, baby, tanning and after sun. Outside of the U.S., we believe we are also the leading Sun Care manufacturer in Mexico with significant presence in Australia and Canada. We expect to continue to drive our worldwide business through product innovation, increased distribution and geographic expansion. 
We offer Wet Ones antibacterial hand wipes and other related products as the leader in the U.S. portable hand wipes category. We expect to utilize our position as market leader to further scale the business and use innovation such as Wet Ones lavender gel, to increase growth.
We have acquired a portfolio of men’s grooming skin care products that have grown under our direction. Our Bulldog skincare products are purpose-built for men and were created to work simply and efficiently while dealing with issues specific to men’s skin. Since acquiring Bulldog, we have expanded sales geographically and are committed to further growth and distribution for the brand. We acquired the Jack Black brand and obtained a footprint in the luxury men’s skincare market and continue to use resources at our disposal to grow the Jack Black brand globally. Our Cremo products compete in the masstige category for men’s grooming, and that offers a complete line of “barber quality” beard, hair and skin care products. 
Feminine Care
In Feminine Care, we market products under the Playtex, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands. We offer tampons under the Playtex Gentle Glide® 360°®, Playtex Sport®, Playtex and o.b. brands, including the Playtex Sport compact tampon launched in 2017. We also market pads and liners under the Stayfree and Carefree brands. We believe we are one of the top three manufacturers of feminine care products in North America, with unique, competitive product technologies and well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. We intend to continue to invest in innovation in our feminine care brands. 
Competition
The personal care product categories in which we compete are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and in most international markets, as large manufacturers with global operations and new entrants attempting to disrupt the market compete for consumer acceptance and increasingly limited retail shelf space. Competition is based upon several factors, including brand quality and perception, product formulation and performance, customer service and price and promotion. The continued growth in online sales also puts additional competitive pressure on our Company.
Wet Shave
The global shaving products category is comprised of wet shave blades and razors, electric shavers and shaving gels and creams. With our established brands and product lines and global presence, we believe we compete effectively in this market. Our principal competitors in the global wet shave business are: The Procter & Gamble Company, which owns the Gillette brand and is the leading company in the global wet shave segment; Bic Group, which is expanding beyond its historical strength in the disposable segment; and Dorco, which competes primarily in the private label segment. We also compete with newer entrants to the Wet Shave market for both direct-to-consumer online and traditional retail shelf space including Unilever (Dollar Shave Club brand), Harry's, Perio (Barbasol and PureSilk brands), Beiersdorf (Nivea branded women’s wet shave product in Germany) and numerous other online start-ups.
Sun and Skin Care
The markets for sun and skin care are also highly competitive, characterized by the frequent introduction of new products accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs. Our competitors in these markets consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies, including Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson. 
The sun care categories globally are characterized historically by global growth and is impacted by trends in skin care. With our balanced sun care portfolio, depth of sun care formulation expertise and global presence, we believe we compete effectively and have more than doubled our international sun care business since acquiring the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic brands in 2008. We intend to continue to compete by driving product innovation, building differentiated brand equity and focusing on in-store visibility.
The global men’s skin care market is expected to continue to grow, with increased demand for men’s personal care products. Our competitors in this market include large companies such as Johnson & Johnson, L’Oréal S.A., The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. and Unilever, as well as smaller companies. We compete in the market by creating simple and effective skin care products with natural ingredients at multiple price points through our Bulldog and Cremo skin care products and in the luxury men’s skin care market with Jack Black. 
Feminine Care
The markets for feminine care and other personal products are characterized by large manufacturers with global presence, as well as new market entrants, and is likewise very competitive, with a large number of domestic and foreign competitors, including The Procter & Gamble Company and Kimberly Clark Corp. With our acquisition of the Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands, we expanded our presence within the feminine care product category and became one of the top three manufacturers in North America. We compete by having a portfolio of well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. 
Sales and Distribution
Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force and supplemented by strategic exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. In the U.S., Japan and larger markets in Western Europe and Latin America, we have dedicated commercial organizations, reflecting the scale and importance of these businesses to our Company. In several countries where we do not have dedicated commercial organizations, we utilize third-party distributors and wholesalers. As a result of increased competition through the expansion of online markets, we have established e-commerce operations across several business lines, including global Schick.com websites providing men’s and women’s shaving products, Bulldog direct to consumer sites, Jack Black direct to consumer sites, an acceleration of e-commerce sales in China through our partnership with T-Mall and the addition of Billie. We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, and military stores. 
Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, only Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Walmart”), as a group, account for more than 10% of our consolidated annual net sales. Walmart accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales in fiscal 2022. Purchases by Walmart included products from all of our segments. Target Corporation represented approximately 11% of net sales for our Sun and Skin Care segment and 11% for our Feminine Care segment, respectively. 
Generally, orders are shipped within a month of their order date. Because of the short period of time between order and shipment dates, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume.
Government contracts do not represent a material portion of our net sales.
Seasonality
Customer orders for sun care products within our Sun and Skin Care segment are highly seasonal, which has historically resulted in higher sun care sales to retailers during the late winter through mid-summer months. Within our Wet Shave segment, sales of women’s products are moderately seasonal, with increased consumer demand in the spring and summer months. See “Our business is subject to seasonal volatility” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our products include steel, various plastic resins, plastic based components, textile fibers and non-woven fabrics, organic and inorganic chemicals, soap-based lubricants and plastic-pulp based packaging. These materials are sourced on a regional or global basis, as applicable, and are generally available from multiple sources. Price and availability of our raw materials fluctuate over time. While we have confidence our supply assurance plans adequately support our current operational needs, we cannot predict the future with certainty. Both price and supply are subject to risk from global socio- and macroeconomic influences such as, but not limited to, force majeure, loss or impairment to key manufacturing sites, transportation, government regulation, currency or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have avoided significant interruption in the availability of our input materials and believe that our extensive experience and global reach in procurement will continue to allow us to manage these risks effectively.
Patents, Technology and Trademarks
We own a number of U.S. and international trademarks, which we consider of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with our other trademarks. These include, but are not limited to: Edgewell™, Schick, Schick Hydro, Schick Hydro Silk, Hydro Connect™, Wilkinson Sword, Intuition, Quattro, Xtreme 3, Billie, Protector™, Silk Effects, Slim Twin, Edge, Skintimate, Personna, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog, Jack Black, Cremo, Gentle Glide, Sport, Sport Level Protection™, Wet Ones, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. As a result of the Playtex acquisition, we also own royalty-free licenses in perpetuity to the Playtex trademark in the U.S. and in many international jurisdictions related to certain feminine hygiene and other products but excluding certain baby care and apparel-related products. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
Our ability to compete effectively in the Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care personal care categories depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements. We own or license a considerable number of patents, patent applications and other technology from third parties, which we believe are important to our business. These relate primarily to shaving product improvements and additional features, feminine care hygiene products including digital and applicator tampons, pads and liners, sunscreen formulations and manufacturing processes.
As of September 30, 2022, we owned, either directly or beneficially, approximately 412 unexpired U.S. patents, which have a range of expiration dates from October 2022 to February 2040, and we had approximately 57 pending U.S. patent applications. We routinely prepare additional patent applications for filing in the U.S. and actively pursue foreign patent protection in various countries. As of September 30, 2022, we owned, either directly or beneficially, approximately1,120 foreign patents, having a range of expiration dates from October 2022 to August 2046, and we had approximately 114 pending patent applications in foreign countries.
We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations by governmental agencies intended to protect the public health and environment, including those governing the manufacture, use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, labeling and notice requirements related to consumer exposure to certain chemicals, and requirements for the recycling of our products and their packaging. These agencies include, but are not limited to (i) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and equivalent international agencies that regulate ingredients in consumer products; (ii) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities; and (iii) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations in the European Union (the “E.U.”).
Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities, as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. In connection with certain sites, we have received notices from the EPA, state agencies and private parties seeking contribution that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and, as a result, we may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to a number of federal “Superfund” sites. In addition to potential costs to clean up our own properties, we may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites and certain international locations.
The amount of our ultimate liability in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including the volume and toxicity of material contributed to the site, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the remediation methods and technology to be used. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of the underlying facts, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change or other factors.
The U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (“TSCA”) and similar laws in other jurisdictions are intended to ensure that chemicals do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. TSCA requires the EPA to maintain the TSCA registry listing chemicals manufactured or processed in the United States. Chemicals not listed on the TSCA registry cannot be imported into or sold in the U.S. until registered with the EPA. TSCA also sets forth specific reporting, recordkeeping and testing rules for chemicals, including requirements for the import and export of certain chemicals, as well as other restrictions relevant to our business. Pursuant to these laws, the EPA from time to time issues Significant New Use Rules, or SNURs, when it identifies new uses of chemicals that could pose risks to human health or the environment and also requires pre-manufacture notification of new chemical substances that do not appear on the TSCA registry. When we import chemicals into the U.S., we must ensure that chemicals appear on the TSCA registry prior to import, participate in the SNUR process when a chemical we import requires testing data and report to the EPA information relating to quantities, identities and uses of imported chemicals.
Many European countries, as well as the E.U., have been very active in adopting and enforcing environmental regulations. As such, it is possible that new regulations may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries.
REACH requires manufacturers and importers of chemical substances to register such substances with the European Chemicals Agency, or the ECHA, and enables European and national authorities to track such substances. Depending on the amount of chemical substances to be manufactured or imported, and the specific risks of each substance, REACH requires different sets of data to be included in the registration submitted to the ECHA. Registration of substances with the ECHA imposes significant recordkeeping requirements that can result in significant financial obligations for companies such as ours to import products into Europe. REACH is accompanied by legislation regulating the classification, labeling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures.
We believe that our facilities and products are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations. 
Sustainability 
Edgewell’s Sustainable Care 2030 program is our ambitious strategy that we believe will enable us to sustain and grow our business while inspiring a world where the joy of caring for yourself is balanced with caring for our shared planet and society. Unveiled in 2020, Sustainable Care 2030 includes clear commitments and targets across our brands, operations and supply chain, as well as our workforce and communities. These 2030 targets include (i) 100% renewable electricity and carbon neutrality across our global operations; (ii) reducing use of virgin petroleum-based plastic content in products and packaging; (iii) using 100% recyclable, compostable or reusable plastic packaging; (iv) reducing waste by 10% and pursuing zero waste to landfill across production facilities; and (v) driving a sustainability culture by ensuring each global location has a sustainability program to take action on localized efforts.
We are making significant progress on our goals, including in priority areas such as sustainable products and packaging, alternative materials innovation, ingredient stewardship and transparency, responsible sourcing, and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization, among others. However, there is no guarantee that we will achieve our environmental sustainability priorities in whole or in part on or before 2030.
Additional information related to our social impact and sustainability matters can be found at www.edgewell.com/pages/sustainability. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website, is not part of, and not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Employee Profile 
At Edgewell, we are committed first and foremost to people: our employees, the consumers who use our products, the suppliers and retailers who partner with us, and the communities in which we operate. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 7,000 employees, with 2,100 based in the United States. Certain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. We have cultivated a culture that is centered around our guiding purpose of Making Useful Things Joyful, supported by a set of values and behaviors that guide organizational actions and decisions, underpinned by a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Our foundational values of “People first,” “Move forward,” “Listen up and speak up” and “Own it together” support a culture of celebration, agility, authenticity, and collaboration. This culture promotes trust and teamwork, which results in bold and aggressive goals, smart risks, and an environment where innovation and ideation thrive. We continue to reinforce our foundational values through several key initiatives:
•Our performance management process provides for increased accountability to model our values by incorporating a ‘360-degree Values Assessment’ that evaluates each employee’s performance not only on the results achieved, but on how they achieve them.
•In 2021, we launched an internal recognition platform, InspireJOY, to recognize those exhibiting our values through recognition awards from managers and peers. Since launch, we have seen over 55,000 recognition moments.
Employee Wellness
The wellness of our people remains a primary focus and we believe that the most productive people are those who are at their best, both physically and mentally. Our employees have access to several programs related to employee wellness including onsite wellness testing and education; mental and emotional health awareness and support; and work-life balance through flextime, remote and hybrid working arrangements and parental leave, among others. Additionally, we continue to monitor the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) infection rates at all our locations and implement protocols such as the use of masks, when necessary, in order to protect our employees.
Ensuring a positive, purposeful working experience for our employees that is reflective of our purpose and values is central to our business operations. We continually monitor employee retention rates and believe our progressive human resources policies, learning and development, talent management, workplace health and safety, and community engagement and support activities enable us to attract and retain key personnel. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to our continued efforts to create a work environment where every individual feels respected, connected, valued and empowered in our work environment. We continually look for ways to support the global workforce, consumers and the communities we serve. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) principles are also reflected in our values and behaviors, and in particular with respect to our policies against harassment or bullying. We continue to enhance our DEI policies to value all individuals who make up our teams.
During 2022, we advanced our focus on DEI through many specific actions including:
•Our CEO continued his commitment through the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™, a coalition uniting business leaders to advance DEI in the workplace through education, training, dialogue and action. Several of Edgewell’s senior leaders attended this year’s annual meeting and have incorporated best practices into the global organization.
•We continued with our commitment to the Board Diversity Action Alliance, an organization taking action to increase the representation of racially and ethnically diverse directors on corporate boards.
•We have partnered with Out & Equal Workplace advocates to help LGBTQ+ people thrive and support organizations to create a culture of belonging for all.
•Our Director of DEI is leading and advancing our global DEI strategy as well as supporting our Teammate Resource Groups who remain focused on celebrating Edgewell’s inclusive culture for everyone.
•To continue with the bias training that was delivered to senior leadership, we have offered teammates the opportunity to attend training on mitigating bias as well as specialized training for Human Resources Business Partners on Strategic DEI partnering. 
Overall, DEI is an important part of our sustainability strategy with a focus on sustaining the safety and well-being of our employees, the people who use our products, the partners with whom we work and the communities we serve. We will build upon the commitments outlined in our Sustainable Care 2030 strategy to promote an open and inclusive culture where everyone is treated fairly and with respect so that we can retain and attract the best talent. 
Teammate Experience 
We understand that to attract and retain great people, we must listen to and engage them regularly. Each year, we conduct an anonymous employee experience survey to gauge our progress and identify the areas in the employee experience where we excel and areas for improvement. For the survey conducted in June 2022, our overall positivity score was 74% with 5,332 employees interacting with the survey. This was an increase of 3% in overall positivity score from 2021 with an 8% increase in employee participation.
Global actions we implemented in the fiscal year 2022 include: 
•Developed a new program called Impactful Feedback. This program is for all employees and provides a framework and structure around giving constructive feedback with the training objective to provide more robust and meaningful feedback to others. Approximately 71% of our global salaried workforce have participated. 
•Introduced a newer version of the career map document and support tools for all teammates globally. This program has created a shared responsibility between employees, their direct reports and the organization to identify and provide teammates with personal and professional growth opportunities.
•Enhanced our ways of working to help manage workload and fatigue through a commitment to a team-based approach using team agreements for our new hybrid ways of working.
•Began to focus on supporting our People Managers with tools and training to lead with empathy which will continue in fiscal year 2023. 
In addition to global themes, our employee experience results identified diverse priorities at the functional, country, and team levels. Our goal is to support our People Managers in taking accountability for their results and to empower them to make changes at a local level to improve the employee experience.
