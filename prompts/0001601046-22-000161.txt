To complement our direct sales force, we have an extensive network of channel partners around the world. These channel partners include resellers, manufacturer’s representatives and distributors. They serve thousands of customers across a wide range of end-user markets. They are expected to provide the same level of service and support as our direct sales force for the products they sell and generate new sales opportunities to extend our reach. Electronic commerce and telesales channels are also in place for transactional, lower-touch sales.
For certain verticals such as network monitoring and performance management, our go-to-market solution strategy is based on strategic relationships with technical partners to provide the customer with a complete solution. In these cases, we work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations, and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
Manufacturing 
To maximize our productivity and our ability to respond to market conditions, we have significant in-house manufacturing capabilities that are supplemented by contract manufacturers. Our in-house manufacturing efforts are focused on the highest value added, more complex and highly technical aspects of production, and we use contract manufacturers for assembly, printed circuit board production and chassis assembly. We have centralized manufacturing in Penang, Malaysia, our largest manufacturing facility, which focuses on the final assembly of our most sophisticated instruments and on final tuning, calibration and test of instruments across the broader portfolio. Our other principal manufacturing facilities are in California and Colorado in the United States, and Germany and Japan outside of the United States.
We also operate three technology centers located in Santa Rosa, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Boeblingen, Germany that collectively provide key components and sub‑systems for our instruments, including microwave monolithic integrated circuits, thick and thin film circuits, optical components, high-speed probes and precision machining. Our technology centers provide a competitive advantage by developing and manufacturing differentiated technology components with performance levels that are not commercially available. We plan our supply chain based on forecasts, and generally manufacture and configure the finished products upon receipt of firm orders.
Marketing
Keysight Global Marketing builds the company brand and drives growth through programs that increase awareness, reputation, and demand for Keysight’s design, simulation, emulation, and test solutions. We employ a multi-pronged marketing strategy to enhance brand equity, including articulating a strong, cohesive brand purpose, establishing our presence and thought leadership in existing and promising emerging markets, resulting in one powerful brand voice for Keysight. We fuel growth initiatives through online digital transformation, high-value content, new product launches, and sophisticated digital demand 

generation programs tailored to local markets, to attract new accounts. As the world enters the post-pandemic era, we’re blending virtual and physical events to broaden our reach, while capitalizing on the benefits of physical interactions. We continue to expand Keysight University, an online learning hub for engineers, with inbound marketing events and compelling courses that deliver key insights from registrants into Keysight’s marketing engine. At our premium Keysight World virtual events around the globe, we bring together customers, industry visionaries, and Keysight experts to share the applications and benefits of emerging technologies to accelerate industry breakthroughs. We continuously evolve our marketing practices and technology stack in order to support a data-driven approach to our sales and marketing. 
Human Capital
We have a diverse, inclusive and respectful work environment, where employees are offered challenging assignments, development opportunities, competitive salaries and a safe workplace. As of October 31, 2022, we had approximately 15,000 employees worldwide representing more than 80 self-identified nationalities working in 30 countries. Of those employees, 5,500 are located in the Americas (including 5,300 in the U.S.), 2,800 are located in Europe and 6,700 are located in Asia.
Culture, Values and Standards
Our core values and culture reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and outstanding corporate citizenship. We adhere to the tenets of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and core International Labor Organization conventions, and we are an affiliate member of the Responsible Business Alliance. We comply with the labor and employment laws of all countries in which we operate, prioritizing fair employment practices, labor compliance, non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity. The KLM is the framework for how we do business, enabling us to execute on our strategies for the benefit of our customers, stockholders and employees while operating within our values of Speed and Courage, Uncompromising Integrity, High Performance, Social Responsibility and One Keysight. 
We believe our culture, which fosters employee inclusion, engagement and innovation, is a competitive advantage. We are committed to maintaining a work environment founded on respect for all, regardless of race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status, national origin, or any protected class. Our Keysight Standards of Business Conduct ("SBC") govern our dealings with our customers, competitors, suppliers, third-party partners, as well as with our fellow employees, and is available for review on our website. Our employees are responsible for upholding the SBC, and SBC training is required annually for all our employees. 
Oversight and Governance
The Chief People and Administrative Officer ("CAO") is responsible for developing and executing the company’s human capital strategy. Our strategy incorporates global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, diversity, equity and inclusion, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, education and organization development. The CAO is responsible for developing and integrating the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion priorities and strategy.
The Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and CAO regularly update our board of directors and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) on human capital matters. 
Hiring, Retention and Succession Planning
We understand that Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ("STEM") education is critical to creating a pipeline of future engineers, and we provide global support for STEM education through a variety of company-sponsored and employee-led programs, which introduce school-age students to engineering.
Our talent acquisition and Human Resources teams work with business leaders to understand and align on how our business goals and strategies impact our talent needs. The teams use this information to inform recruiting efforts and to build talent pipelines to support growth. In partnership with the marketing team, we have built a strong company brand utilizing multiple communication platforms to better enable us to attract top talent.
We continue to refine and expand our talent acquisition strategies and processes. As part of our talent acquisition strategy, we provide training to recruiters and hiring managers to assist them in recruiting and hiring top talent. We had a global job acceptance rate of 83.2 percent in 2022. The number of software engineers in our R&D function have more than doubled since we became an independent company in 2014.
Our business leaders are required to periodically evaluate employee contributions to the company and to identify key contributors, as well as those in need of improvement. Our annual rewards process provides employees with feedback on their 

performance over the past fiscal year and rewards achievement. Working with Human Resources, business leaders develop retention strategies and initiatives to keep critical talent focused and engaged and to minimize attrition. The average tenure of our employees is 12.2 years. Our three-year average employee turnover rate was approximately 7 percent and has been lower than the industry average for the past five years.
We continue to develop our leadership capability. We have identified core competencies for leadership positions along with a learning and development framework that can help leaders refine their skills. Succession planning sessions are conducted annually in each business and at many levels in the organization, including the executive level. These reviews provide visibility to top talent, potential leadership gaps, and development plans.
Globally, 4 percent of our employee population is eligible to retire. In the U.S. and Japan, employees eligible to retire are 24.8 percent and 17.3 percent, respectively. We recognize that many of these employees have valuable skills and historical information and that knowledge transfer is critical. We have created knowledge transfer practices to enable us to retain critical knowledge. In the U.S., we have a program specifically designed to enable retirement-ready critical talent to gradually reduce hours leading up to retirement, giving us time to transfer critical information and processes. Once retired, these former employees are given the opportunity to consult with us on a limited basis to provide on-going mentoring and training.
Diversity and Equal Employment Policy
We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. The value we place on diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") is a competitive advantage, and it helps us attract and retain the best talent and drive high performance through innovation and collaboration. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives and cultures work together.
DE&I is among our top priorities. In addition to our broader DE&I initiatives, we set near-term objectives to increase representation of women globally and under-represented minorities in the U.S. We have a DE&I Director who is responsible for driving strategy and for implementation of new and ongoing DE&I initiatives.
In order to increase the pool of diverse candidates for open positions, we participate in diversity-focused career fairs and conferences in the U.S., Asia and Europe. We identify diversity recruiting business champions to develop business-specific talent acquisition plans, and we have partnerships with universities worldwide that are aligned with our strategic talent needs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCU") in the United States.
In an effort to enable employees to be successful, we provide mentoring programs, inclusive benefits, access to employee network groups, and training for every stage of employment.
As of October 31, 2022, women represented 30.6 percent of our global workforce, and underrepresented minorities represented 37.7 percent of the U.S. workforce. The percentage of women in leadership positions (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President, Senior Manager, Integrating Manager, Operating Manager and Supervisor) globally was 24.4 percent and the percentage of underrepresented minorities in the U.S. was 33.3 percent. At the senior executive level (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President), 23.4 percent were women and 24.0 percent were underrepresented minorities. Our Board has eleven members, three of whom are women, and three are self-identified underrepresented minorities.
In the rest of the workforce, we seek to expand hiring of women globally and underrepresented minorities in the U.S. We established annual hiring goals to improve our workforce diversity. In 2022, 32.6 percent of our global external new hires were women, falling short of our 2022 goal of 35.4 percent. In 2022, 49.1 percent of external new hires in the U.S. were underrepresented minorities, exceeding our goal of 47.4 percent. For fiscal year 2023, the adjusted hiring goals for global external new hires being women is 33.6 percent, and external new hires in the U.S. being underrepresented minorities is 50.1 percent. A metric in our short-term executive compensation program for fiscal year 2023 is tied to the achievement of these goals. To measure achievement of this goal, we use the following definition of underrepresented minorities: Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, or gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. 
Learning and Development
We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit that creates a mindset of professional growth and continuous improvement. We emphasize on-the-job learning through stretch assignments and development opportunities, as well as education. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, classes and resources to help them excel in their careers. Our Keysight University platform offers training and development programs, as well as learning resources. Our Employee 

Educational Assistance Program provides financial and management support to eligible employees, allowing them to pursue academic degrees related to their field of work. 
Many of our employees are required to take annual training courses related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy, contributing to an inclusive workplace, and workplace health and safety. We also have leadership development programs including training for new managers and development through ExecOnline. We hold an annual Keysight Executive Development ("KED") program with senior leaders to align on strategy and key focus areas for the company.
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees' contributions to value creation and business results. We seek to achieve pay parity across our organization and in 2022 maintained a worldwide women-to-men pay parity of nearly 1:1.
Listening to Employees
We provide multiple avenues for employee input. Our Open-Door Policy provides employees with direct access to any level of management to discuss ideas, get input on career development and discuss concerns in a constructive manner. The MyVoice program fosters inclusion through engagement surveys on a variety of topics that give us insight on what employees value and helps us identify where to prioritize our efforts. We also created a global Inclusion Council comprised of employees from all functions across the globe to help formulate our inclusion goals and track our progress.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment and provide a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety. Our programs include recognition and control of workplace hazards, ergonomics training, a global travel health program, and robust emergency and disaster recovery plans. We promote the health and wellness of our employees through our Employee Well Being programs and workplace accessibility and accommodations.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue (booked as deferred revenue), and orders for goods that were shipped but not yet recognized, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer. At October 31, 2022, our backlog was approximately $2,550 million as compared to approximately $2,115 million at October 31, 2021, primarily driven by strong order growth, supply-chain constraints, and an increase in solution sales with a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange movements. In accordance with our order acceptance policy, we continue to expect the majority of backlog to be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property 
We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark. 
Materials 
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials, such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address the potential disruption in, and other risks related to, our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of solutions for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at optimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. With the global shortages and increased lead-times for materials such as semiconductors and passive components, we align our purchase lead-times 

through placement of advance of purchase orders where necessary. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulations
Our company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and solutions, and it is our policy to comply with the laws in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include but are not limited to those related to environment, corruption, bribery, import and export controls, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor and data privacy. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks related to government regulations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental Regulations
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur additional costs in the future.
Some of our properties have been the subject of ongoing remediation by HP Inc. ("HP") for subsurface contamination that was known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the "Separation"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations. On December 17, 2021, Keysight and HP signed a restrictive covenant related to our Santa Rosa facility which prohibits certain uses of the property (such as running a daycare facility, hospital or school) and terminates HP’s remediation obligation related to that facility. HP’s remediation obligations relating to Keysight’s Colorado Springs facility are ongoing.
We maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
Import/Export Regulations
We sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with the U.S Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs limiting or banning sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations. 
On August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $6.6 million to be paid over three years, $2.5 million of which was suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. To date, we have paid $2.1 million of the penalty. The suspended portion of the penalty has been satisfied by amounts we have spent on qualifying compliance activities to date. 

In February 2022, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and other restrictions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. As a result, after an initial suspension of operations in Russia, we permanently discontinued our Russian operations and are exiting Russia.
Changes in these or other import or export laws and regulations may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell certain products and solutions and may require us to develop additional compliance programs and training.
Anti-Corruption Regulations
As a result of our extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs. 
Data Privacy Regulations 
With extensive operations all over the world, we must comply with complex regulations governing data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and data privacy regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations require careful handling of internal data. We have internal data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations and devote resources to keep up with changing data privacy regulations. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risk of fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs related to compliance and may restrict our business operations.
Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to and comply with health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations may differ by country, requiring us to keep track of varied and complex requirements. In the U.S. we are subject to federal and state Occupational Health and Safety laws as well as federal, state and local requirements.
