ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Cardlytics makes marketing more relevant and measurable through our purchase intelligence platform. With purchase data from more than 2,000 financial institutions, we have a secure view into where and when consumers are spending their money. By applying advanced analytics to this massive aggregation of purchase data, we make it actionable, helping marketers identify, reach and influence likely buyers at scale, and measure the true sales impact of their marketing spend. This collection of debit, credit, ACH, and bill pay data represented approximately $1.5 trillion in 2017 consumer spend in the United States, or U.S. In 2017, our platform analyzed over 20.0 billion online and in-store transactions across more than 100.0 million accounts in the U.S., including one in five debit and credit card swipes in the U.S. 
 Our founders understood the value of purchase data and have devoted nearly a decade to engineering a purchase intelligence platform. As former bankers, they recognized that banks and credit unions, which we refer to as financial institutions, or FIs, enable and collect the different types of electronic payments (e.g., debit, credit, bill pay) consumers and businesses use. This was especially crucial as electronic payments were becoming an increasing portion of all consumer spending. With this data distributed across approximately 10,000 FIs in the U.S. alone, it would need to be aggregated and standardized to provide effective foundational data for marketing technology and analytics. Given their deep insight into FIs rigorous security, privacy and regulatory concerns, our founders were well positioned to partner with FIs and architected our platform with their requirements in mind. Today, our platform leverages machine learning and a robust set of algorithms to ingest, process, and analyze trillions of dollars of raw purchase data from tens of millions of accounts. 
 As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, we were a partner to 1,659 and 2,035 FIs, respectively, including Bank of America, National Association, or Bank of America; PNC Bank National Association, or PNC; Branch Banking and Trust Company, or BB&T; SunTrust Banks, Inc., or SunTrust; Lloyds TSB Bank plc, or Lloyds; Santander UK plc., or Santander; and several of the largest bank processors and digital banking providers to reach customers of small and mid-sized FIs. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, we launched a pilot implementation of Cardlytics Direct with Wells Fargo & Company, or Wells Fargo, directed at Wells Fargo customers located in Miami, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. As the amount of revenue that we can generate from marketers with respect to Cardlytics Direct is primarily a function of the number of active users on our FI partners digital banking platforms, we believe that the number of monthly active users, or FI MAUs, contributed by any FI partner is indicative of our level of dependence on such FI partner. 
 Our platform helps solve fundamental problems for marketers. Marketers increasingly have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their own stores and websites. However, they lack insight into their customers purchase behavior outside of their stores and websites, as well as the purchase behavior of individuals who are not yet customers. The reality is, no matter how robust their own customer data, marketers only see a small portion of their customers overall spendboth within and across categories. As a result, it is very difficult for businesses to focus their marketing investments on the most valuable customers. Marketers are also challenged to measure the performance of their marketing. This issue is particularly acute with respect to measuring the impact of marketing on in-store sales, where approximately 92% of consumer spending occurs, according to 2016 U.S. Census data. We believe purchase intelligence is the next disruptive opportunity in marketing and can comprehensively address these challenges. Our purchase intelligence platform is designed to enable marketers to identify, reach and influence likely buyers at scale, and precisely measure how marketing drives sales by closing the loopboth online and in-store. We have strong relationships with leading marketers across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurant and retail chains as well as large providers of cable, satellite television and wireless services. 
 We have proven the power of purchase intelligence with our proprietary native advertising channel, Cardlytics Direct. We have created a powerful, highly captive native advertising channel that reaches customers when they are thinking about their finances. By consolidating the largely untapped, high growth digital banking channels of more than 2,000 FIs, Cardlytics Direct enables marketers to reach consumers across these FIs through their online and mobile banking accounts, and increasingly through email and various real-time notifications. Using our purchase intelligence, our platform predicts where FI customers are likely to shop next and then presents them with offers to save money in these categories at a time when they are thinking of their finances.

We are extending the power of our platform beyond Cardlytics Direct. As we built scale, we recognized a significant opportunity to extend the impact of our purchase intelligence platform, which we refer to as our Other Platform Solutions. For example, we use purchase intelligence to help marketers measure the impact of marketing campaigns outside of the Cardlytics Direct channel on in-store and online sales. As we have in the past, we plan to continue to work in close collaboration with our FI partners to develop new purchase-intelligence based analytic solutions. 
 We have experienced rapid growth in our revenue since inception. Our revenue, which excludes consumer incentives, was $53.8 million, $77.6 million, $112.8 million and $130.4 million for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 34.3%. For 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, our FI MAUs were approximately 34.8 million, 39.0 million, 43.9 million and 54.9 million, respectively, and our average Cardlytics Direct revenue per user was $1.41, $1.65, $2.23 and $2.23, respectively. For 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, our net loss was $38.9 million, $40.6 million, $75.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. Our historical losses have been driven by our substantial investments in our purchase intelligence platform and infrastructure, which we believe will enable us to expand the use of our platform by both FIs and marketers. In 2016, our net loss included a $25.9 million one-time non-cash charge related to the termination of our U.K. agreement with Aimia EMEA Limited, and a $10.9 million non-cash charge related to the issuance and change in fair value of convertible promissory notes. Our net loss in 2017 includes a $5.0 million non-cash gain related to the change in fair value of convertible promissory notes. 
 Industry Background 
 Recent Disruptions in the Marketing Industry 
 The fundamental imperative for marketers is to determine how, when, and where to spend marketing dollars effectively and to measure the efficacy of, and return on, their marketing investments. In the past 20 years, there have been a series of disruptive innovations impacting how marketers reach and influence likely buyers. The rise of internet-enabled online advertising drastically accelerated the pace of innovation across the marketing landscape. As the internet became mainstream, search-driven advertising brought the ability to more precisely connect marketing to consumer intent. The advent of social media provided marketers with a greater opportunity for consumer engagement and a wealth of additional data about consumer preferences. Each of these innovations has made digital marketing increasingly more effective and efficient than traditional media. However, like television and other traditional forms of advertising, these new forms of digital advertising still fail to provide marketers with visibility into whether an advertisement ultimately resulted in an in-store purchase. This information gap is particularly acute since approximately 92% of consumer spending continues to occur in-store. Marketers remain unable to close the last mile and comprehensively understand how marketing impacts actual in-store and online consumer purchases. 
 Challenges to Efficient and Effective Marketing 
 The fundamental challenges faced by marketers include: 
 

 | Imprecise Targeting Across Media Channels. Although marketing through digital channels is perceived to provide marketers with a greater ability to target and measure efficacy, online targeting typically relies on online behavior, demographic, and other behavioral data to find an audience, which are imprecise proxies for future purchasing behavior. Offline advertising relies on similar data to determine how to allocate advertising spending. Regardless of channel, targeting based only on these types of information fails to capture important differences among consumers who may appear to be similar on the surface, but actually have drastically different interests and purchasing patterns.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Inability to Measure Efficacy and Ensure ROAS. Many organizations lack the ability to measure return on marketing investments. Marketers are under immense pressure to show that their investments are creating value for their organizations. However, due to the fact that substantially all retail purchasing continues to occur in-store, it is difficult to calculate ROAS accurately because marketers cannot comprehensively connect online or offline marketing campaigns to in-store purchases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Narrow View of Existing and Potential Customers. Marketers today increasingly have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their stores and on their websites. However, they lack insight into these customers overall purchasing patterns outside of their stores and websites and the purchasing behavior of other likely buyers who are not yet customers. As a result, marketers struggle to answer fundamental questions such as: Who are my best customers? Are my best customers loyal to me or do they actually spend more with my competitors? Who are the potential customers spending with my competitors, but not with me?
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purchase Intelligence: The Next Disruptive Opportunity 
 We believe that purchase intelligence is the next disruptive opportunity in marketing. Aggregated consumer spending data analyzed with advanced analytics has the potential to make all marketing more relevant and measurable if it can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to help predict and measure future buying behavior, both in-store and online. 
 Massive and Fragmented Source of Purchase Data and Consumer Connectivity 
 We believe that FIs are a crucial source of purchase data and have a valuable, direct touchpoint with consumers. Over the past decade, the volume of consumer purchase data held by FIs has significantly increased. These electronic transactions produce an immense amount of consumer purchase data, which can provide valuable insights on where and when consumers choose to shop, how frequently they shop at a particular store, and how much they spend within and across retail categories. Further, non-credit electronic spending is widely dispersed over thousands of FIs, with no party providing an aggregated view at scale. 
 For purchase intelligence to be actionable, purchase data must be connected to the consumer through electronic touchpoints. The digital marketing ecosystem consistently struggles with this challenge. Consumers interact across thousands of online touchpoints. It is often difficult to identify the consumer across these multiple touchpoints. FIs have uniquely reliable consumer touchpoints. FIs touchpoints do not face the same issues as other digital channels. Consumers interact with FIs via authenticated online or mobile applications that are protected with state-of-the-art security. FI touchpoints allow for purchase data to be connected to consumers across the media landscape and thereby become actionable. 
 Market Forces in the Banking Industry 
 While FIs play an important role in securely maintaining purchase data, market forces have only recently aligned to create incentives for FIs to leverage this data for the benefit of marketers. FIs operate in an increasingly regulated and competitive environment. Further, the rising popularity of alternative banking solutions and the emergence of non-banking players in the areas of lending and electronic payments increasingly threaten to disintermediate traditional FIs from their customers. These trends have keenly focused FIs on finding ways to engage customers and strengthen customer loyalty. Despite these incentives, FIs typically lack the specialized technological expertise, scale and visibility outside of their own customer bases to analyze and effectively leverage purchase data. As such, although purchase data from any single FI and access to that institutions customer base may be very useful to marketers, aggregated purchase data across a meaningful portion of the fragmented banking landscape from a variety of electronic payment channels holds significantly greater value. 
Challenges to Effective Purchase Data Aggregation 
 The challenges to effective aggregation of purchase data include: 
 

 | Lack of Scale. Purchase data resides with approximately 10,000 FIs in the U.S. alone. Although payment processors and payment networks have access to data across multiple FIs, each lacks access to data from all different forms of electronic payments and the ability to electronically connect this disparate payment data to consumers. To understand a consumers spending, marketers require an expansive view across the payment landscape, including debit card, credit card, bill pay and ACH, that no single FI is able to provide.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fragmented Touchpoints. As with purchase data, FI digital touchpoints are spread across thousands of disparate institutions. Further, FIs generally lack the technology to connect purchase data to their customers online, mobile and television presences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Privacy and Regulatory Concerns. FIs are highly regulated and are under strict obligations to safeguard their customers personal data. To be viable, any data aggregation strategy must navigate the complex privacy and regulatory compliance concerns and obligations of FIs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Need to Create Uniformity Across Complex and Varied Data Sets. Each FI captures and retains data differently and the underlying data is itself dynamic. For example, payments made at a single retailer for the same transaction are often identified in different ways at different FIs and retailers are continuously evolving the way in which they capture, process and remit purchase data to FIs. As a result, sophisticated algorithms and analytics are required to make the complex web of purchase data meaningful and actionable for marketers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To unlock the value of the FIs purchase data, we believe that there is a significant need for a trusted third party to serve as the nexus for purchase data aggregation and analytics.

Key Benefits of Our Platform 
 We make marketing more relevant and measurable through our purchase intelligence platform, while simultaneously driving customer engagement and loyalty for FIs. 
 Key benefits to marketers: 
 

 | Comprehensive View of Consumer Behavior. We leverage the power of our platform to provide Cardlytics Direct marketers with valuable insights into the preferences of their actual or potential customers both within and outside the context of a marketing campaign. We build on the insight marketers have todayhow their customers are spending in their own stores and websiteswith our insight into how their customers are spending elsewhere. With a broad view of purchase behavior at scale, we can also help identify likely buyers who are not yet customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Precise Targeting in a Captive Channel. With access to consumers aggregate purchase data at particular FIs, not just their spending with a single marketer, we enable marketers to identify, reach and influence likely buyers in the highly captive native bank advertising channel. By analyzing billions of purchases across tens of millions of consumers, we believe that we are able to predict future consumer intent based on prior purchase behavior. Cardlytics Direct enables marketers to deliver highly relevant offers to customers inside of trusted and private banking channels. With our purchase intelligence, marketers can reach the right consumer, at the right time, in this channel with a relevant message.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Accurate Measurement of Marketings Impact on Sales. We measure the impact of marketing efforts by analyzing actual purchase databoth online and in-store. This enables us to determine the actual return on advertising spend from marketing campaigns within and outside Cardlytics Direct and helps marketers optimize ongoing and future campaigns. Unlike other measurement solutions on which the marketing industry has historically relied, our measurement of return on advertising spend is not probabilistic or based on models, but based on actual purchases by consumers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Compelling Return on Advertising Spend. Because we typically price our solutions based on actual purchases from the applicable marketer, rather than based on impressions served or clicks, we are able to ensure that marketers realize a return on their marketing spend with us.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Key benefits to FIs: 
 

 | Cash Back Incentives to FI Customers. Cardlytics Direct allows customers of our FI partners to receive personalized offers and cash back rewards which we refer to as Consumer Incentives. Our FIs customers have earned more than $251 million in aggregate cash back incentives to date, and we believe that these savings drive increased customer engagement with our FI partners online and mobile banking applications and increased loyalty in the form of reduced account attrition rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | New Economics to FIs. Because we share a portion of the revenue that we generate from marketers with FIs, we also provide FIs with an attractive incremental revenue opportunity. From inception through December 31, 2017, we have paid approximately $174 million in aggregate FI Share, which is a negotiated and fixed percentage of our billings to marketers less any Consumer Incentives that we pay to the FIs customers and certain third-party data costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Support for FI Marketing and Business Initiatives. We believe that we enable our FI partners to create competitively differentiated offerings that reinforce their broader strategic goals, including marketing their own productssuch as mortgages, car loans, or 529 plansdirectly to customers with the same precision targeting available to marketers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths 
 We make marketing more relevant and measurable through our purchase intelligence platform. We believe that the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages: 
 

 | Deeply Embedded with FIs. Our founders were bankers who understood the power of historical purchase data and the needs of marketers. Our platform was architected with our FI partners in mind and is designed to ensure that no personally identifiable information, or PII, ever leaves the FI. We have partnered with over 2,000 FIs and no FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our platform. We are generally the exclusive provider of native bank channel advertising to our FI partners as online and mobile banking portals are not conducive to supporting marketing content from different vendors. Further, native bank channel advertising requires deep technological integrations, which we believe increases the cost of switching vendors and therefore increases FI partner loyalty to us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our Proprietary Consumer Touchpoints. With all of our FI partners, we enable marketers to reach consumers in a captive, largely untapped, and digitally engaging environment, when they are thinking about their finances. We have access to consumers both on the web and mobile, and are increasingly reaching them through various other channels, including emails and real-time notifications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Massive Reach Informed by Purchase Intelligence. Our platform aggregated and analyzed approximately $1.5 trillion in U.S. purchase data in 2017 across stores, retail categories, and geographies, both online and in-store, representing over 20.0 billion transactions across more than 100.0 million accounts in the U.S. While we also have access to credit card consumer purchase data, a substantial majority of the purchase data on our platform is in the form of debit, ACH and bill pay transactions. We provide marketers with the opportunity to leverage this aggregated and unique data set to precisely reach millions of consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Significant Scale with Marketers and Compelling ROAS. We work with companies across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurant and retail chains as well as large providers of cable, satellite television and wireless services. By serving these marketers at scale, we have developed deep insight into consumer behavior, which has allowed us to optimize how we reach and influence likely buyers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Powerful, Self-Reinforcing Network Effects. We see significant network effects within Cardlytics Direct. By adding new marketers and increasing the potential incentives provided to our FIs customers, we are able to increase engagement within our FIs digital banking channels. This, in turn, attracts more FIs to our platform, adding to our scale, and making our platform more valuable to marketers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to Improve Marketing. Consumers spend 92% of their purchase dollars in physical stores and digital marketers have long sought efficient and effective ways to understand online-to-offline attribution. Likewise, although marketers may have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their stores and on their websites, they lack visibility about these customers overall purchasing patterns and the purchasing behavior of other likely buyers. In addition to reaching consumers through our proprietary Cardlytics Direct channel, we use purchase intelligence to help marketers measure the impact of marketing campaigns outside of the Cardlytics Direct channel on in-store and online sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proprietary Technology Architecture and Advanced Analytics Capabilities. We have designed our purchase intelligence platform to protect highly sensitive first-party data. Our proprietary, distributed architecture helps facilitate both the effective delivery of our solution and the protection of our FI customers PII. No PII is shared by the FIs with Cardlytics. Key aspects of our technology are hosted at the FI partners data center. Other aspects of our technology, including those responsible for facilitating the creation of advertising campaigns, evaluating results of campaigns and controlling and providing software updates, are hosted at our data centers, behind our firewalls. These technological components work together, leveraging proprietary algorithms, to process raw purchase data into normalized purchase history useful for marketing and analytics. Our platform also supports integration of data from our FI partners and from third-party sources to enrich the intelligence that we are able to provide. Further, we apply advanced analytics and use machine learning to continuously increase our intelligence capabilities and identify actionable behavior patterns for our marketers. Our advanced analytics capabilities are what transforms our unique purchase dataset into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happenedand, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and FIs rely on to make smarter business decisions and more meaningful customer connections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | World-Class Management Team with Unique Combination of Backgrounds and Experiences. Our teams extensive experience across banking, technology and marketing is invaluable in our ability to forge relationships with financial and marketing partners, and understand the technical complexities inherent in building a platform that is transforming and disrupting the marketing industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategies 
 The principal components of our strategy include the following: 
 

 | Grow Our Cardlytics Direct Business with Marketers. While we already work with many large marketers, our purchase intelligence currently captures only a small portion of their overall marketing spend. We are continually adding new marketers to our platform, and consistently growing spend with previous cohorts of marketers. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to grow our Cardlytics Direct business with existing marketers and attract new brands, retailers and service providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Drive Growth through Existing FI Partners. We intend to drive revenue growth by continuing to increase customer adoption and improve the effectiveness of FIs digital channels. The revenue that we generate from the incentive programs of each of our FI partners varies. This variance is typically a result of how long the program has been active, the user interface for the program and the FIs efforts to promote the program. We continually work with FIs to improve their customers user experience, increase customer awareness, and leverage additional customer outreach channels like email.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

 | Expand our Network of FI Partners. We will continue to focus on growing our network of FI partners by integrating directly with large regional and national banks and by reselling our solution through financial processors and payment networks. Given our substantial investments to date in our purchase intelligence platform and infrastructure, we believe that we will be able to add FIs to our platform with modest incremental investment. Each new FI partner increases the size of our data asset, increasing the value of our platform to both marketers and FIs that are already part of our FI network.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Grow Our Platform Through Integrations with Partners. We believe that we can improve the value proposition for marketers through the use of purchase intelligence. We intend to continue to partner with other media platforms, marketing technology providers and agencies that can utilize our platform to serve a broad array of customers. To facilitate these partnerships, we intend to focus on continued technological integration of our platform with those of complementary market participants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Innovate and Evolve Our Platform. As we continue to grow our data asset and enhance our platform, we are developing new solutions and increasingly sophisticated analytical capabilities. As we have in the past, we plan to continue to work in close collaboration with our FI partners to develop new purchase intelligence based analytic solutions for marketing and other industries that satisfy the demanding requirements of financial services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Purchase Intelligence Platform 
 Data Asset 
 With purchase data from more than 2,000 financial institutions, we have a secure view into where and when consumers are spending their money. Our technology aggregates and analyzes purchase data without any PII leaving the FI. In 2017, our platform analyzed over 20.0 billion online and in-store transactions across more than 100.0 million accounts in the U.S., including one in five debit and credit card swipes in the U.S. We believe that access to this purchase data can only be obtained on an aggregated basis by partnering directly with FIs. This data allows us to serve relevant advertisements to our FIs customers through our Cardlytics Direct native bank advertising channel. We also leverage the power of purchase intelligence to provide marketers with valuable insights into the preferences of their actual or potential customers outside the context of a marketing campaign. For example, we have securely connected our platform to numerous other data sources and analytics platforms. Through these connections, we can help marketers measure the impact of their marketing investments outside of the Cardlytics Direct channel. 
 Importantly, the information that we collect does not enable us to identify any particular individual. Although we have access to large volumes of granular data from our FI partners and others, without PII, we do not use this information to decipher individual identity. Further, to the extent that we receive proprietary data from an individual marketer, we only use such information for the benefit of that marketer. We only provide aggregated, anonymized information to marketers. 
 Advanced Analytics Capabilities 
 The advanced analytics and machine learning we apply to our unique purchase dataset are what transforms it into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happenedand, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and FIs rely on to make smarter business decisions and more meaningful customer connections. 
 We analyze the impact marketing campaigns have on in-store and online sales. Since we are able to measure sales impact, marketers can use our purchase intelligence to optimize future campaigns and further inform their marketing across a variety of channels. Given our granular view into consumer spending across all categories, we can also help marketers identify share shift among key competitors, and learn more about where else their customers spend their money. 
 For FIs, we use our analytics to optimize the offers we display to FI customers within our Cardlytics Direct channel. By assigning relevancy scores to each offer based on what customers are most likely to buy, our platform then presents the most relevant offers earlier in customers online and mobile banking sessions. This increases the likelihood that customers activate, redeem, and earn more cash back on the things they care about most. At the same time, marketers gain more opportunities to get valuable content in front of the right audience. 
 In addition to using our analytics to drive our partners businesses, we use it to drive our own as well. We use advanced analytics to accurately predict the impact FI changes will have on our network. As we on-board new FI partners, make Cardlytics Direct UI improvements, or reach FI customers through new channels (e.g., email, real-time notifications), we are able to accurately predict how these changes will affect our network performance, and we can plan accordingly.

Distributed Architecture 
 A crucial aspect of our platform is our patented distributed architecture, which helps to facilitate both the effective delivery of our solutions and the protection of customer PII. Our Offer Placement System, or OPS, and Offer Management System, or OMS, form the core of our Cardlytics Direct solution and are the foundation for our other solutions. 
 The OPS is often hosted at the FI partners data center, behind the FI partners firewall, but we may also host the OPS on behalf of FI partners. The OPS tracks impressions, engagement, activation and redemptions and is responsible for targeting and presenting offers, which are developed and designed with the OMS, to the FIs customers. Each of our FI partners has its own instance of the OPS, regardless of where hosted, which consists primarily of a web application and database that interact with the FIs web servers to deliver marketing into the FIs online banking portal. The OPS interfaces with FI systems to receive anonymized purchase data, assigns a unique consumer ID to each FI customer, which we call a Cardlytics ID, and aggregates this purchase data. The Cardlytics ID is then used to assign offers as well as to anonymously link a consumers media presences, including online and mobile, to the consumers purchase data. 
 The OMS is hosted in our data centers behind our firewall and is responsible for facilitating the creation of marketing campaigns, evaluating the results of campaigns, and controlling and providing regular software updates to the deployed OPS. 
 Our Technology Infrastructure 
 We rely on our highly sophisticated software and hardware infrastructure to deliver our solutions. We currently manage our infrastructure through outsourced data centers. We receive and integrate into our data, on average, hundreds of millions of purchase transactions per week from our FI partners. Our system cleans and transforms this data and matches it to a retail category, spend amount and type metrics, geography and merchant, as well as time horizon. Our systems are designed to handle hundreds of varied formats in which we receive data and transform them into a common standard for use in our solutions. 
 We have implemented a number of security controls. Our security controls have been audited and certified by third parties using standards which include SOC 1, SOC 2 and OWASP. Sensitive data is subject to encryption, anonymization, or de-identification depending on the use case and risk profile. We enhance network security through measures such as network segmentation, firewalls and network and host based intrusion detection at critical network aggregation and ingress/egress points. 
Our Solutions 
 Segment Information 
 We have two reportable segments: Cardlytics Direct and Other Platform Solutions. Our Cardlytics Direct segment represents our proprietary native bank advertising channel. Our Other Platform Solutions segments represents solutions that enable marketers and marketing service providers to leverage the power of purchase intelligence outside the banking channel. Information about segment revenue is set forth in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Cardlytics Direct 
 Our first solution, Cardlytics Direct, is focused on unlocking the power of purchase intelligence in our own native advertising channel. We designed and created Cardlytics Direct by embedding our proprietary technology into our FI partners online and mobile banking platforms. Through Cardlytics Direct, marketers can deliver advertising content to FI customers in the form of an opportunity to earn rewards, which are funded with a portion of the fees we collect from marketers. Additionally, Cardlytics Direct benefits FI customers by enhancing their experiences by showing them relevant advertisements tailored to their specific needs based on their specific purchase history. 
 We analyze customers purchase history to help predict where they are most likely to shop next. This enables us to help marketers find high potential new customers that are active in their category, but not currently shopping with them, or to grow their business with existing customers. Our marketing is targeted and measured with each individual customers actual spending information. However, all targeting and reporting is aggregated across consumers in our FI network. Unlike other measurement solutions on which the marketing industry has historically relied, our measurements are not probabilistic or based on models, but are based on actual purchases. 
 The breadth of our FI partner network means that we are able to offer marketers the ability to optimize their marketing efforts to reach a large number of consumers through a single point of contact. Our Cardlytics Direct solution also offers our FI partners a scalable solution for driving customer loyalty and engagement with little effort on their part, as we handle everything from contracting with marketers, building, running and reporting performance of the marking campaigns to allocating incentives to our FIs customers.

We currently sell Cardlytics Direct in the U.S. and United Kingdom, or U.K. 
 We believe all types of marketing can be more effectively directed and measured with purchase intelligence. We designed our purchase intelligence platform to leverage the massive, growing and actionable foundational data asset that we amassed with Cardlytics Direct. We seek to connect our purchase data with other datasets to provide deeper visibility into the overall, online and in-store, purchasing patterns of their actual and potential customers. Our purchase intelligence platform enables marketers and marketing service providers to leverage the power of purchase intelligence outside the bank channel. 
 Other Platform Solutions 
 We have expanded our platform to use purchase intelligence to provide solutions outside the bank channel. These Other Platform Solutions include the measurement of campaigns and business insights. We currently have the right to use purchase intelligence from four FI partners, who collectively represented approximately $750 billion in 2016 annual consumer purchase transaction data or 14% of total U.S. consumer purchase transaction data in 2016, according to a 2017 study from The Nilson Report, outside the banking channel. We are continually working with our FI partners and marketers to expand the scope of our solutions to meet market demands. 
Our FI Partners 
 We partner with FIs to offer incentive programs through their digital banking channels. We define an FI partner as either a separate contracting entity from which we generate revenue directly or from which we generate revenue through a third-party intermediary, such as a bank processor, digital banking provider or payment network operator. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, we were a partner to 1,659 and 2,035 FIs, respectively, including Bank of America, PNC, BB&T, SunTrust, Lloyds, Santander, and several of the largest bank processors and digital banking providers, such as Digital Insight Corporation, a subsidiary of NCR Corporation, or Digital Insight; Fidelity Information Services, LLC, or FIS, and Fiserv Solutions, Inc., or Fiserv, to reach customers of small and mid-sized FIs. We are actively working with FIS and Fiserv to increase awareness of our solutions among small and mid-sized FIs in order to drive increased adoption. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, we launched a pilot implementation of Cardlytics Direct with Wells Fargo directed at Wells Fargo customers located in Miami, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. 
 During 2015, 2016 and 2017, our largest FI partner, Bank of America contributed approximately 50%, 47% and 51% of our total FI MAUs, respectively. Lloyds, our largest FI partner in the U.K., contributed approximately 9%, 10% and 9% of our total FI MAUs in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had direct contractual relationships with 17 of our FI partners, while our other FI partners became part of our network through bank processors and digital banking providers, such as Digital Insight. Digital Insight contributed approximately 15%, 13% and 11% of our total FI MAUs in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Further, while FI partners that were part of our network through our relationships with Digital Insight contributed approximately 11% of our total FI MAUs for the year ended December 31, 2017, these indirect FI partners represented substantially all of our total FI partners as of December 31, 2017. 
 From inception to date, no FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our solution. FIs that become part of our network through bank processors and digital banking providers may terminate their relationships with these bank processors and digital banking providers and thereby indirectly terminate their relationships with us. Any such terminations would not be captured in the calculation of our retention rate. 
 Our Agreements with Bank of America 
 Since November 2010, our relationship with Bank of America has been governed by a General Services Agreement, or GSA, pursuant to which we provide Bank of America with access to Cardlytics Direct and certain other related services, and a related Software License, Customization and Maintenance Agreement, which grants Bank of America the right to use the software underlying Cardlytics Direct. The GSA terminates on November 4, 2021 and may be extended by Bank of America for additional one year periods. 
 The services we provide to Bank of America under the GSA include forming relationships with participating marketers; obtaining and publishing marketer offers to customers after screening both the marketer and specific advertising content; and monitoring redemption rates with respect to Consumer Incentives offered in Cardlytics Direct campaigns. Although we are primarily responsible for securing marketers to advertise on Cardlytics Direct, Bank of America may likewise secure marketers and has the right to approve all marketer offers to be presented to Bank of America customers on Cardlytics Direct.

Under the GSA, we share the revenue that we generate from the sale of advertising within the Bank of America Cardlytics Direct channel with Bank of America, subject to certain exceptions. The amounts that we pay to Bank of America are reflected as FI Share. During 2015, 2016 and 2017, Bank of America accounted for 63%, 64% and 63% of our aggregate FI Share, respectively. The specific FI Share percentage that we pay is based on whether we or Bank of America have secured the relevant marketer account and other marketer- and transaction-specific factors, provided that we are entitled to retain a minimum percentage of the monthly revenue subject to the GSA. As one of the first major FIs to join our network, the FI Share rate payable to Bank of America is higher than the FI Share rate payable to FIs that joined our network more recently. 
 In connection with entering into certain supplements to the GSA and the related license agreement, in March 2011 we granted to an affiliate of Bank of America a 10-year warrant to purchase up to (i) 78,101 shares of our common stock at an exercise prices of $2.52 per share and (ii) 312,402 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.52 per share. 
 Our Marketers 
 We enable marketers and their agencies to efficiently and effectively market to our FIs customers through Cardlytics Direct. We work with companies across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurant and retail chains as well as large providers of cable, satellite television and wireless services. Our top five marketers represented 23% of revenue for each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. For the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, we did not have any marketer that individually represented 10% or more of our revenue. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales teams are focused on expanding our FI network as well as our marketer and agency customers. Our marketing team is centralized and focuses on increasing market awareness for Cardlytics through partnerships, public relations, industry events and publications. For 2015, 2016 and 2017, our total sales and marketing expenses were $32.8 million, $31.3 million and $31.9 million, respectively, representing approximately 42%, 28% and 24% of revenue, respectively. 
Marketers 
 We have dedicated sales teams responsible for establishing relationships with marketers and their agencies. Our go-to-market efforts are organized by industry vertical, which include restaurants, retail, cable and satellite television providers and wireless carriers. Each vertical team is led by an experienced general manager and staffed with sales, sales support and service specialists who have deep domain knowledge and industry operating experience. We also have account managers that manage our customer relationships within each vertical. 
Financial Institution Partners 
 Our go-to-market efforts for expanding our FI network are focused on nurturing our existing banking relationships and cultivating new relationships. From inception to date, no FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our solution. Our FI partner sales team is focused on driving FIs to enhance their user interface for our white label program, otherwise drive increased consumer engagement and encourage adoption of our solution offerings. 
Research and Development 
 Our culture is centered on innovation. We pioneered purchase intelligence and continue to focus on enhancing and broadening our platforms capabilities. Our development efforts extend beyond our core technology as we look to help our FI partners enhance overall user experience both on the web and in mobile apps. As a result of our investment in research and development, we were able to expand our solutions offerings beyond Cardlytics Direct. For 2015, 2016 and 2017, our total research and development expenses were $11.6 million, $13.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 15%, 12% and 9% of revenue, respectively. 
Our Competition 
 The market for the utilization of purchase intelligence is nascent and we believe that there is no company that can provide purchase intelligence with the scale and the level of granularity that is equivalent to ours. With respect to Cardlytics Direct, we believe that we are the only company that enables marketing through FI channels at scale. As we expand our solutions, we expect to compete with a number of established companies, as well as numerous emerging market entrants. In the future, we may face competition from online retailers, credit card companies, digital publishers and mobile pay providers with access to a substantial amount of consumer purchase data. While we may successfully partner with a wide range of companies that are to some extent currently competitive to us, these companies may become more competitive to us in the future. As we introduce new solutions, as our existing solutions evolve and as other companies introduce new products and services, we are likely to face additional competition.

 | ability to leverage purchase data to inform marketing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | depth and breadth of relationships with financial institution partners, marketers and their agencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------


 | ability to attract, retain and develop leading-edge analytical and technical talent.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider and innovator of purchase intelligence. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had three issued patents and 10 patent applications pending relating to our software. Our issued patents relate to a distributed system for inserting offers into online banking and expire on October 24, 2028. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. 
 We have registered the Cardlytics name and logo in the U.S. and certain other countries. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the U.S. and other countries; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. 
 We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available. 
 We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include cardlytics.com and similar variations on that name. 
 In order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, financial institution partners, marketers, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights. 
 
12 
 
Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our FI partners, which we typically indemnify against such claims. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. 
 Privacy and Security 
 We have architected privacy and security into our systems and practices. A critical part of our strategy involves not collecting, maintaining or using sensitive information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information or medical records. We currently do not receive any PII in connection with the delivery of any of our solutions. We only receive data in aggregate and target marketing against anonymized data. This approach to privacy is intended to protect consumers. Our privacy and security standards have also been designed and implemented to meet the requirements and safeguard the reputations of our FI partners and marketers, many of which are large, multinational corporations. These customers frequently audit our practices and engage in detailed assessments of our infrastructure. 
 Despite the fact that we do not receive any PII from FIs, privacy and security are among our highest priorities and we commit significant resources to protecting the data that we receive. We have implemented, assess on an ongoing basis, and, when necessary, upgrade our physical, procedural and technical controls. We also take steps to impose compliance with these controls on our service providers via contract. 
 A cornerstone of our practices is transparency in data use and consumer choice. Our privacy policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we use it. Additionally, we maintain an opt-out alternative on our website for any consumer to utilize if they wish to be excluded from our targeting. Additionally, our FI partners maintain opt-out alternatives for any consumer wishing to opt out of Cardlytics Direct. 
 Outside of the U.S., our privacy and data handling practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business, which may be more restrictive than the requirements that we are subject to in the U.S. 
 Financial Information About Geographic Areas 
 For information regarding our revenue by geographic area and long-lived assets by geographic area, please refer to Note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Seasonality 
 Our cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter, largely due to the seasonal nature of our marketers advertising spending. Many marketers tend to devote a significant portion of their marketing budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with consumer holiday spending and to reduce spend in the first quarter of the calendar year. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 342 full-time employees, including 63 in delivery, 166 in sales and marketing, 64 in research and development and 49 in general and administrative. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
