Item 1.    Business
Our Company
We are one of the leading providers of parking management, ground transportation and other ancillary services to commercial, institutional and municipal clients in urban markets and airports across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our services include a comprehensive set of on-site parking management and ground transportation services, which include facility maintenance, event logistics services, security services, training, scheduling and supervising all service personnel as well as providing customer service, marketing, and accounting and revenue control functions necessary to facilitate the operation of our clients' facilities or events. We also provide a range of ancillary services such as airport and municipal shuttle operations, valet services, taxi and livery dispatch services and municipal meter revenue collection and enforcement services.
Acquisitions, Investment in Joint Venture and Sale of Business
In October 2014, we entered into an agreement to establish a joint venture with Parkmobile USA, Inc. ("Parkmobile USA") and contributed all of the assets and liabilities of our proprietary Click and Park® parking prepayment business in exchange for a 30% interest in the newly formed legal entity called Parkmobile, LLC ("Parkmobile"). Parkmobile is a leading provider of on-demand and prepaid transaction processing for on- and off-street parking and transportation services. The Parkmobile joint venture combined two parking transaction engines, with SP Plus contributing the Click and Park® parking prepayment systems, which enables consumers to reserve and pay for parking online in advance and Parkmobile USA contributing its on demand transaction engine that allows consumers to transact real-time payment for parking privileges in both on- and off-street environments. We account for our investment in the joint venture with Parkmobile under the equity method of accounting. On January 3, 2018, we closed a transaction to sell our entire 30% interest in Parkmobile to Parkmobile USA, Inc. for a gross sale price of $19.0 million and in the first quarter of 2018, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $10.1 million, net of closing costs.
In August 2015, we signed an agreement to sell and subsequently sold portions of our security business primarily operating in the Southern California market to a third-party for a gross sales price of $1.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of business of $0.5 million, net of legal and other expenses. The pre-tax profit for the operations of the security business was not significant to the periods presented herein. The Company received $0.6 million for the final earn-out consideration from the buyer during the second quarter of 2017, for which we recognized an additional gain of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our Operations
Our history and resulting experience have allowed us to develop and standardize a rigorous system of processes and controls that enable us to deliver consistent, transparent, value-added and high-quality parking facility management services. We serve a variety of industries and have industry vertical specific specialization in airports, healthcare facilities, hotels, municipalities and government facilities, commercial real estate, residential communities, retail operations, and colleges and universities. 
We operate our clients' facilities through two primary types of arrangements: management contracts and leases.

• | Under a management contract, we typically receive a base monthly fee for managing the facility, and we may also receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of facility performance objectives. We also receive fees for ancillary services. Typically, all of the underlying revenue and expenses under a standard management contract flow through to our client rather than to us.


• | Under a lease, we generally pay to the property owner either a fixed annual rent, a percentage of gross customer collections, or a combination of both. Under a lease, we collect all revenue and are responsible for most operating expenses, but typically are not responsible for major maintenance, capital expenditures or real estate taxes.

2
As of December 31, 2017, we operated approximately 82% of our locations under management contracts, and approximately 18% of our locations under leases. We held a partial ownership interest in one leased facility as of December 31, 2017 and two leased facilities as of December 31, 2016.
Our revenue is derived from a broad and diverse group of clients, industry vertical markets and geographies. Our clients include some of North America's largest private and public owners, municipalities, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, sports and special event complexes, hotels, and healthcare facilities. No single client accounted for more than 9% of our revenue, net of reimbursed management contract revenue, or more than 3% of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, we have built a diverse geographic footprint that as of December 31, 2017 included operations in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and municipalities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C. and Houston, among others, and three Canadian provinces. Our strategy is focused on building scale and leadership positions in large, strategic markets in order to leverage the advantages of scale across a larger number of parking locations in a single market.
While a large share of our operating arrangements are fixed-fee management contracts, we continue to grow our lease and management contract businesses. Generally, management contracts provide us with insulation from economic cycles and enhance our earnings visibility because our management contract revenue does not fluctuate materially in relation to variations in parking volumes; our lease contracts may experience variability, as revenues typically increase in periods of improving macroeconomic conditions through increased parking volumes and typically decrease during periods of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions through reduced parking volumes.
Our ability to innovate operations by integrating and incorporating appropriate technologies into our service lines allows us to further strengthen our relationships with clients, improve cost efficiency, enhance customer service and introduce new customer facing services. We also innovate through application of our in-house interactive marketing expertise and digital advertising to increase parking demand, development of electronic payment tools to increase customer convenience and streamline revenue processes, the use of advanced video and intercom services to enhance customer service to parking patrons 24-hours-a-day, the creation of our remote management services technology and operating center that enables us to remotely monitor facilities and parking operations, the use of our License Plate Recognition (LPR) system and video analytics for car counting, on-street enforcement and enhanced security and our proprietary Receivables Management (used for managing monthly parker billing and payment processing system) and centralized receivables system (CARS), also used for managing the monthly parker billing and payment process and providing a comprehensive and reliable billing of the parking-related provisions of multi-year commercial tenant leases.
We continue to be the market leader in the implementation of remote parking management services using technology that enables us to monitor parking operations from a remote, off-site location and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance. In addition, we provide subject matter expertise and other consulting services related to revenue control equipment. We also utilize mobile payment technology, including mobile payment apps, providing our customers with flexibility to meet their parking needs. Finally, we continue to utilize and provide leading on-demand and prepaid transaction processing technology for on- and off-street parking and transportation services. 
As of December 31, 2017, we managed 3,623 parking facility locations containing approximately 2.0 million parking spaces in 350 cities, operated 76 parking-related service centers serving 70 airports, operated a fleet of approximately 700 shuttle buses carrying approximately 36.7 million passengers per year, operated 738 valet locations and employed a professional staff of approximately 20,800 people.
Services
As a professional parking management company, we provide a comprehensive, turn-key package of parking services to our clients. Under a typical management contract structure, we are responsible for providing and supervising all personnel necessary to facilitate daily parking operations including cashiers, porters, valet attendants, managers, bookkeepers, and a variety of maintenance, marketing, customer service, and accounting and revenue control functions.
Beyond the conventional parking facility management services described above, we also offer an expanded range of ground transportation and ancillary services. For example:

• | We provide shuttle bus vehicles and the drivers to operate, for example; through on-airport car rental operations as well as private off-airport parking locations.


• | We provide ground transportation services, such as taxi and livery dispatch services, as well as concierge-type ground transportation information and support services for arriving passengers with transportation network companies.


• | We provide on-street parking meter collection and other forms of parking enforcement services.


• | We provide valet services, including vehicle staging, doorman/bellman services and valet tracking systems with text-for-car capabilities.


• | We provide remote parking management services using technology that enables us to monitor parking operations from a remote, off-site location and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance (including remedying equipment malfunctions).


• | We provide innovative and environmentally compliant facility maintenance services, including power sweeping and washing, painting and general repairs, as well as cleaning and seasonal services.

3

• | We provide comprehensive security services including the training and hiring of security officers and patrol, as well as customized services and technology that are efficient and appropriate for the property involved.


• | We provide multi-platform marketing services including SP+ branded websites which offer clients a unique platform for marketing their facilities, mobile apps, search marketing, email marketing and social media campaigns.

Industry Overview
Overview
The parking industry is large and fragmented and includes companies that provide temporary parking spaces for vehicles on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis along with providing various ancillary services. A substantial number of companies in the industry offer parking services as a non-core operation in connection with property management or ownership, and the vast majority of companies in the industry are small, private and operate a limited number of parking facilities. Additionally, technological advancements are having an impact on both consumer behavior and parking services technology. Accordingly, the industry remains highly fragmented and dynamic. From time to time, smaller operators find they lack the financial resources, economies of scale and/or management techniques required to compete for the business of increasingly sophisticated clients or family owners face difficult generational transfers. We expect this trend to continue and will provide larger parking management companies with opportunities to expand their businesses and acquire smaller operators. We also expect that small new operators will continue to enter the market as they have for the past several decades.
Industry Operating Arrangements
Parking facilities operate under three general types of arrangements:

• | management contract;


• | lease; and


• | ownership.

The general terms and benefits of these three types of arrangements are as follows:
Management Contract
Under a management contract, the facility operator generally receives a base monthly fee for managing the facility and may receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of facility performance objectives. Facility operators also generally charge fees for various ancillary services such as accounting support services, equipment leasing and consulting. Primary responsibilities under a management contract include hiring, training and staffing parking personnel, and providing revenue collection, accounting, record-keeping, insurance and facility marketing services. The facility owner usually is responsible for operating expenses associated with the facility's operation, such as taxes, license and permit fees, insurance costs, payroll and accounts receivable processing and wages of personnel assigned to the facility, although some management contracts, typically referred to as "reverse" management contracts, require the facility operator to pay certain of these cost categories but provide for payment to the operator of a larger management fee. Under a management contract, the facility owner usually is responsible for non-routine maintenance and repairs and capital improvements, such as structural and significant mechanical repairs. Management contracts are typically for a term of one to three years (although the contracts may often be terminated, without cause, on 30-days' notice or less) and may contain renewal clauses.
Lease
Under a lease, the parking facility operator generally pays to the property owner a fixed base rent, percentage rent that is tied to the facility's financial performance, or a combination of both. The parking facility operator collects all revenue and is responsible for most operating expenses, but typically is not responsible for major maintenance, capital expenditures or real estate taxes. In contrast to management contracts, leases typically are for terms of three to ten years, often contain a renewal term, and provide for a fixed payment to the facility owner regardless of the facility's operating earnings. Many of these leases may be canceled by the client for various reasons, including development of the real estate for other uses and other leases may be canceled by the client on as little as 30 days' notice without cause. Leased facilities generally require larger capital investment by the parking facility operator than do managed facilities and therefore tend to have longer contract periods.
Ownership
Ownership of parking facilities, either independently or through joint ventures entails greater potential risks and rewards than either managed or leased facilities. All owned facility revenue flows directly to the owner, and the owner has the potential to realize benefits of appreciation in the value of the underlying real estate. Ownership of parking facilities usually requires large capital investments, and the owner is responsible for all obligations related to the property, including all structural, mechanical and electrical maintenance and repairs and property taxes.

Industry Growth Dynamics
A number of industry trends should facilitate growth for larger outsourced commercial parking facility management providers, including the following:
Opportunities from Large Property Managers, Owners and Developers.   As a result of past industry consolidation, there is a significant number of national property managers, owners and developers that own or manage multiple locations. Sophisticated property owners consider parking a profit center that experienced parking facility management companies can maximize. This dynamic generally favors larger parking facility operators that can provide specialized, value-added professional services with nationwide coverage.
Outsourcing of Parking Management and Related Services.    Growth in the parking management industry has resulted from a general trend by parking facility owners to outsource the management of their parking and related operations to independent operators. We believe that entities such as large property managers, owners and developers, as well as cities, municipal authorities, hospitals and universities, in an effort to focus on their core competencies, reduce operating budgets and increase efficiency and profitability, will continue and perhaps increase the practice of retaining parking management companies to operate facilities and provide related services, including shuttle bus operations, municipal meter collection and valet parking.
Vendor Consolidation.    Based on interactions with our clients, we believe that many parking facility owners and managers are evaluating the benefits of reducing the number of parking facility management relationships they maintain. We believe this is a function of the desire to reduce costs associated with interacting with a large number of third-party suppliers coupled with the desire to foster closer inter-company relationships. By limiting the number of outsourcing vendors, companies will benefit from suppliers who will invest the time and effort to understand every facet of the client's business and industry and who can effectively manage and handle all aspects of their daily requirements. We believe a trend towards vendor consolidation can benefit a company like ours, given our national footprint and scale, extensive experience, broad process capabilities and a demonstrated ability to create value for our clients.
Industry Consolidation.    The parking management industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of small regional or local operators. We believe national parking facility operators have a competitive advantage over local and regional operators by reason of their:

• | broad product and service offerings;


• | deeper and more experienced management;


• | efficient cost structure due to economies of scale; and


• | financial resources to invest in infrastructure and information systems.

General Business Trends
We believe that sophisticated commercial real estate developers and property managers and owners recognize the potential for parking and related services to be a profit generator rather than a cost center. Often, the parking experience makes both the first and the last impressions on their properties' tenants and visitors. By outsourcing these services, they are able to capture additional profit by leveraging the unique operational skills and controls that an experienced parking management company can offer. Our ability to consistently deliver a uniformly high level of parking and related services, including the use of various technological enhancements, allows us to maximize the profit to our clients and improves our ability to win contracts and retain existing locations. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:
A Leading Market Position with a Unique Value Proposition.   We are one of the leading providers of parking management, ground transportation and other ancillary services, to commercial, institutional, and municipal clients in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. We market and offer many of our services under our SP+ brand, which reflects our ability to provide customized solutions and meet the varied demands of our diverse client base and their wide array of property types. We can augment our parking services by providing our clients with related services through our SP+ Facility Maintenance, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Transportation, SP+ Valet Services, SP+ Event Logistics and, in certain sections of the United States and Canada, SP+ Security service lines, thus enabling our clients to efficiently address various needs through a single vendor relationship. We believe our ability to offer a comprehensive range of services on a national basis is a significant competitive advantage and allows our clients to attract, service and retain customers, gain access to the breadth and depth of our service and process expertise, leverage our significant technology capabilities and enhance their parking facility revenue, profitability and cash flow. 
Our Scale and Diversification.   Expanding our client base, industry vertical markets and geographic locations has enabled us to significantly enhance our operating efficiency over the past several years by standardizing processes and managing overhead. This also includes the ability to use our scale and purchasing power with vendors to drive cost savings and benefits to our client base.

• | Client Base. Our clients include some of the nation's largest private and public owners, municipalities, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, sports and special event complexes, hotels, and hospitals and medical centers. 

5

• | Industry Vertical Markets. We believe that our industry vertical market diversification, such as commercial, airports, colleges and universities, healthcare, municipalities, hospitality and event services, allows us to minimize our exposure to industry-specific seasonality and volatility. We believe that the breadth of end-markets we serve and the depth of services we offer to those end-markets provide us with a broader base of customers that we can target. 


• | Geographic Locations. We have a diverse geographic footprint that includes operations in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and three Canadian provinces as of December 31, 2017. 

Stable Client Relationships.    We have a track record of providing our clients and parking customers with a consistent, value-added and high quality parking facility management experience, as reflected by our high location retention rates. Managers, property owners and developers continue to outsource the management of their parking operations and look to consolidate the number of their outsourcing providers; we believe this trend has meaningful benefits to companies like ours, which has a national footprint and scale, extensive industry experience, broad process capabilities, and a demonstrated ability to create value for our clients.
Established Platform for Future Growth.    We have invested resources and developed a national infrastructure and technology platform that is complemented by significant management expertise, which enables us to scale our business for future growth effectively and efficiently. We have the ability to transition into a new location very quickly, from the simplest to the most complex operation, and have experience working with incumbent facility managers to effect smooth and efficient takeovers and integrate new locations seamlessly into our operations.
Predictable Business Model.    We believe that our business model provides us with a measure of insulation from broader economic cycles, because a significant portion of our combined locations operates on fixed-fee and reverse management fee management contracts that for the most part are not dependent upon the level of utilization of those parking facilities. Additionally, because we only have a partial ownership interest in two parking facilities, we have limited the risks of real estate ownership. We benefit further from a recurring revenue model reinforced by high location retention rates.
Highly Capital Efficient Business with Attractive Cash Flow Characteristics.    Our business generates attractive cash flow due to negative working capital dynamics and our low capital expenditure requirements. 
Focus on Operational Excellence and Human Capital Management.    Our culture and training programs place a continuing focus on excellence in the execution of all aspects of day-to-day parking facility operation. This focus is reflected in our ability to deliver to our clients a professional, high-quality product through well-trained, service-oriented personnel, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. To support our focus on operational excellence, we manage our human capital through a comprehensive, structured program that evaluates the competencies and performance of all of our key operations and administrative support personnel on an annual basis. We have also dedicated significant resources to human capital management, providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered primarily through the use of our web-based SP+ University™ learning management system, which promotes customer service and client retention in addition to providing our employees with continued training and career development opportunities.
Our focus on customer service and satisfaction is a key driver of our high location retention rate, which was approximately 92% and 87% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Focus on Operational Safety Initiatives. Our culture and training programs continue to place a focus on various safety initiatives and disciplines throughout the organization, as we continue to develop an integrated approach for continuous improvement in our risk and safety programs. We have also dedicated significant resources to our risk and safety programs by providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered primarily through the use of our web-based SP+ University™ learning management system and our SP+irit in Safety newsletters. 
Our Growth Strategy
Building on these competitive strengths, we believe we are well positioned to execute on the following growth strategies:
Grow Our Portfolio of Contracts in Existing Geographic Markets.    Our strategy is to capitalize on economies of scale and operating efficiencies by expanding our contract portfolio in our existing geographic markets, especially in our core markets. As a given geographic market achieves a threshold operational size, we typically will establish a local office in order to promote increased operating efficiency by enabling local managers to use a common staff for recruiting, training and human resources support. This concentration of operating locations allows for increased operating efficiency and superior levels of customer service and retention through the accessibility of local managers and support resources.
Increase Penetration in Our Current Industry Vertical Markets.    We believe that a significant opportunity exists for us to further expand our presence into certain industry vertical markets, such as colleges and universities, healthcare, and municipalities hospitality and events services. In order to effectively target these new markets, we have implemented a go-to-market strategy of aligning our business by industry vertical markets and branding our domain expertise through our SP+ operating division designations to highlight the specialized expertise, competencies and services that we provide to meet the needs of each particular industry and customer. Our developed SP+ brand, which emphasizes our specialized market expertise and distinguishes our ancillary service lines from traditional parking, includes a broad array of our operating divisions such as, SP+ Commercial Services, SP+ Airport Services, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Healthcare Services, SP+ Hospitality Services, SP+ Municipal Services, SP+ Office Services, SP+ Residential Services, SP+ Retail Services, SP+ Valet Services and SP+ University Services, which further highlight the 
6
market-specific subject matter expertise that enables our professionals to meet the varied parking and transportation-related demands of those specific property types. Because our capabilities range beyond parking facility management, our SP+ Transportation, SP+ Facility Maintenance, and SP+ Event Logistics brands more clearly distinguish those service lines from the traditional parking services that we provide under our SP+ Parking, Standard Parking, Central Parking and USA Parking brands. 
Expand and Cross-Sell Additional Services to Drive Incremental Revenue.    We believe we have significant opportunities to further strengthen our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients, by continuing to cross-sell value-added services that complement our core parking operations. These services include shuttle bus operations, taxi and livery dispatch services, valet services, concierge-type ground transportation, on-street parking meter collection and enforcement, facility maintenance services, remote management, parking consulting and billing services.
Expand Our Geographic Platform.    We believe that opportunities exist to further develop new geographic markets through new contracts, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships. Clients who outsource the management of their parking operations often have a presence in a variety of urban markets and seek to outsource the management of their parking facilities to a national provider. We continue to focus on leveraging relationships with existing clients that have locations in multiple markets as one potential entry point into developing new core markets.
Focus on Operational Efficiencies to Further Improve Profitability.    We have invested substantial resources in information technology and continually seek to consolidate various corporate functions where possible in order to improve our processes and service offerings. In addition, we will continue to evaluate and improve our human capital management to ensure a consistent and high-level of service for our clients. The initiatives undertaken to date in these areas have improved our cost structure and enhanced our financial strength, which we believe will continue to yield future benefits. SP+ Remote Management Services allows us to provide remote parking management services, whereby personnel are able to monitor revenue and other aspects of a parking operation and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance (including remedying equipment malfunctions). After consolidating remote operations, we have begun expanding the locations where our remote management technology is installed. We expect this business to grow as clients focus on improving the profitability of their parking operations by decreasing labor costs at their locations through remote management.
Pursue Opportunistic, Strategic Acquisitions.    The outsourced parking management industry remains highly fragmented and presents a significant opportunity for us. Given the scale in our existing operating platform, we have a demonstrated ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions and investments, such as Central in 2012 and our former minority interest investment in Parkmobile in 2014. We will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and joint venture investment opportunities that help us acquire scale or further enhance our service capabilities.
Grow and expand the Hospitality Business.    SP+ Hospitality is a leader in the valet industry, and management continues to believe there is significant opportunity to use SP+'s capabilities to further develop a national valet business. Our objective is to focus on the most important aspects of the valet business promptly upon obtaining a new location, from the first contact with a potential customer to the execution of our services. Given the importance of neat, clean and polite service, the success of our valet business is dependent upon ensuring that its valet associates deliver excellent service every day. To accomplish this objective, our SP+ University™ provides training to its valet associates. SP+ University™ continuously provides training to our valet professionals to become an integrated extension of our clients' staff and blend seamlessly into the overall hospitality experience. 
Business Development
Our efforts to attract new clients are primarily concentrated in and coordinated by a dedicated business development group, whose background and expertise is in the field of sales and marketing, and whose financial compensation is determined to a significant extent by their business development success. This business development group is responsible for forecasting sales, maintaining a pipeline of prospective and existing clients, initiating contacts with such clients, and then following through to coordinate meetings involving those clients and the appropriate members of our operations hierarchy. By concentrating our sales efforts through this dedicated group, we enable our operations personnel to focus on achieving excellence in our parking facility operations and maximizing our clients' parking profits and our own profitability.
We also place a specific focus on marketing and client relationship efforts that pertain to those clients having a large regional or national presence. Accordingly, we assign a dedicated executives to those clients to manage the overall client relationship, address any existing portfolio issues as well as to reinforce existing and develop new account relationships, and to take any other action that may further our business development interests.
Competition
We face direct competition for additional facilities to manage or lease, while our facilities themselves compete with nearby facilities for our parking customers and in the labor market generally for qualified employees. There are only a few national parking management companies that compete with us. However, we also face competition from numerous smaller, locally owned independent parking operators, as well as from developers, hotels, national financial services companies and other institutions that manage their own parking facilities as well as facilities owned by others. Many municipalities and other governmental entities also operate their own parking facilities. Additionally, technological factors which improve ride-sharing capabilities and increase the use of parking aggregators can impact our business. Some of our present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we have, which may negatively impact our ability to retain existing contracts and gain new contracts. 
7
We also face significant competition in our efforts to provide ancillary services such as shuttle bus services and on-street parking enforcement because of the number of large companies that specialize in these services. 
We believe that we compete for management clients based on a variety of factors, including fees charged for services, ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients, accurate and timely reporting of operational results, quality of customer service, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. Factors that affect our ability to compete for leased locations include the ability to make financial commitments, long-term financial stability, and the ability to generate revenues and control expenses. Factors affecting our ability to compete for employees include wages, benefits and working conditions.
Support Operations
We maintain regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico in order to support approximately 20,800 employees and 3,623 locations. These offices serve as the centralized locations through which we provide the employees to staff our parking facilities as well as the on-site and support management staff to oversee those operations. Our administrative staff accountants are based in those same offices and facilitate the efficient, accurate and timely production and delivery of client deliverables, such as monthly reporting, etc. Having these all-inclusive operations and accounting teams located in regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico allows us to add new locations in a seamless and cost-efficient manner.
Our overall basic corporate functions in the areas of finance, human resources, risk management, legal, purchasing and procurement, general administration, strategy and information and technology are based in our Chicago corporate office and Nashville support office.
Clients and Properties
Our client base includes a diverse cross-section of public and private owners of commercial, institutional and municipal real estate.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 20,800 individuals, including 13,100 full-time and 7,700 part-time employees and as of December 31, 2016, we employed 22,500 individuals, including 13,700 full-time and 8,800 part-time employees. Approximately 30% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and represented by labor unions. Various union locals represent parking attendants and cashiers in the following cities: Akron (OH), Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Buffalo, Burbank, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Long Beach (CA), Los Angeles, Manchester (NH), Meadowlands, Miami, New York City, Newark, Ontario (Canada), Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, Richmond, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Santa Monica, Seattle, Washington, DC. and Windsor Locks. 
We are frequently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with various union locals. No single collective bargaining agreement covers a material number of our employees. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Insurance
We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur in the operations that we lease or manage including coverage for general/garage liability, garage keepers legal liability, and auto liability. In addition, we purchase workers' compensation insurance for all eligible employees and umbrella/excess liability coverage. Under our various liability and workers' compensation insurance policies, we are obligated to pay directly or reimburse the insurance carrier for the deductible / retention amount for each loss covered by our general/garage liability, our automobile liability, our workers' compensation, and our garage keepers legal liability policy. As a result, we are effectively self-insured for all claims up to the deductible / retention amount for each loss. We also purchase property insurance that provides coverage for loss or damage to our property and in some cases our clients' property, as well as business interruption coverage for lost operating income and certain associated expenses. Because of the size of the operations covered and our claims experience, we purchase insurance policies at prices that we believe represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to parking facility owners on a stand-alone basis. The clients for whom we operate parking facilities pursuant to management contracts have the option of purchasing their own liability insurance policies (provided that we are named as an additional insured party), but historically most of our clients have chosen to obtain insurance coverage by being named as additional insureds under our master liability insurance policies. Pursuant to our management contracts, we charge those clients an allocated portion of our insurance-related costs.
We provide group health insurance with respect to eligible full-time employees (whether they work at leased facilities, managed facilities or in our support offices). We self-insure the cost of the medical claims for these participants up to a stop-loss limit. Pursuant to our management contracts, we charge those clients an allocated portion of our insurance-related costs.
8
Regulation
Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in some cases, municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities. Our facilities in New York City are, for example, subject to extensive governmental restrictions concerning automobile capacity, pricing, structural integrity and certain prohibited practices. Many cities impose a tax or surcharge on parking services, which generally range from 10% to 50% of revenues collected. We collect and remit sales/parking taxes and file tax returns for and on behalf of our clients and ourselves. We are affected by laws and regulations that may impose a direct assessment on us for failure to remit sales/parking taxes or to file tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients.
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In connection with the operation of parking facilities, we may be potentially liable for any such costs.
Several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car-pooling and the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage. These types of laws have adversely affected our revenues and could continue to do so in the future. For example, the City of New York and Boston imposed restrictions in the wake of terrorist attacks, which included street closures, traffic flow restrictions and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour. It is possible that cities could enact new or additional measures such as higher tolls, increased taxes and vehicle occupancy requirements in certain circumstances, which could adversely impact us. We are also affected by zoning and use restrictions and other laws and regulations that are common to any business that deals with real estate.
In addition, we are subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including but not limited to federal, state and local regulations relating to wage and hour matters, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination, human rights laws and whistle blowing. Several cities in which we have operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so-called "living wage" ordinances, which could adversely impact our profitability by requiring companies that contract with local governmental authorities and other employers to increase wages to levels substantially above the federal minimum wage. In addition, we are subject to provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended ("OSHA"), and related regulations. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In connection with certain transportation services provided to our clients, including shuttle bus operations, we provide the vehicles and the drivers to operate these transportation services. The U.S. Department of Transportation and various state agencies exercise broad powers over these transportation services, including, licensing and authorizations, safety and insurance requirements. Our employee drivers must also comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation, including those related to drug and alcohol testing and service hours. We may become subject to new and more restrictive federal and state regulations. Compliance with such regulations could hamper our ability to provide qualified drivers and increase our operating costs.
We are also subject to consumer credit laws and credit card industry rules and regulations relating to the processing of credit card transactions, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Payment Card Data Security Standard. These laws and these industry standards impose substantial financial penalties for non-compliance.
Various other governmental regulations affect our operation of parking facilities, both directly and indirectly, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). Under the ADA, all public accommodations, including parking facilities, are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For example, the ADA requires parking facilities to include handicapped spaces, headroom for wheelchair vans, attendants' booths that accommodate wheelchairs and elevators that are operable by disabled persons. When negotiating management contracts and leases with clients, we generally require that the property owner contractually assume responsibility for any ADA liability in connection with the property. There can be no assurance, however, that the property owner has assumed such liability for any given property and there can be no assurance that we would not be held liable despite assumption of responsibility for such liability by the property owner. Management believes that the parking facilities we operate are in substantial compliance with ADA requirements.
Regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") may affect our business. The FAA generally prohibits parking within 300 feet of airport terminals during times of heightened alert. The 300 foot rule and new regulations may prevent us from using a number of existing spaces during heightened security alerts at airports. Reductions in the number of parking spaces may reduce our gross profit and cash flow for both our leased facilities and those facilities we operate under management contracts.
