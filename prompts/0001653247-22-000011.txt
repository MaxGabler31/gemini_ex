Item 1. Business
Overview
Waitr Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Waitr,” “we,” “us” and “our”) operates an online ordering technology platform, providing delivery, carryout and dine-in options, connecting restaurants, drivers and diners in cities across the United States. The Company’s technology platform includes the Waitr, Bite Squad and Delivery Dudes mobile applications, collectively referred to as the “Platforms”. The Platforms are a convenient way to discover, order and receive great food and other products from local restaurants, national chains, grocery stores and other merchants. Our strategy is to bring in the logistics infrastructure to underserved populations of merchants and establish strong market presence or leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. As of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 1,000 cities across the United States.
Our business has been built with a merchant-first philosophy by providing differentiated and brand additive services to the restaurants on the Platforms. These merchants benefit from the online Platforms through increased exposure to consumers for expanded business in the delivery market and carryout sales. The intuitive, easy-to-use Platforms allow consumers to browse local restaurants and menus, track order and delivery status, and securely store previous orders for ease of use and convenience. For diners, Waitr optimizes the journey from restaurant and food discovery through delivery, while providing a diverse restaurant selection and a great customer experience. 
Additionally, Waitr facilitates merchant access to third-party payment processing solution providers, pursuant to the acquisition of ProMerchant LLC, Cape Cod Merchant Services LLC and Flow Payments LLC (collectively referred to herein as the “Cape Payment Companies”) in August 2021 (the “Cape Payment Acquisition”) (see Part II, Item 8, Note 4 – Business Combinations). The Cape Payment Acquisition is part of our overall growth strategy, positioning the Company to be able to facilitate access to a full suite of third-party payment processing solutions to its current base of restaurants and other merchants in targeted industries.
We generate revenue primarily when diners place an order on one of the Platforms. Our revenue consists primarily of net fees received from restaurants and net diner fees generated on these orders. Additionally, in connection with the Cape Payment Acquisition, the Company generates revenue by facilitating merchant access to third-party payment processing solution providers and receiving a residual payment from the payment processing solution provider.

Our Operations
We have created differentiated software platforms, purpose-built to connect restaurants, drivers and diners. Our business has been built with a focus on quality through providing brand-additive services to restaurants, which in turn benefits diners by providing a diverse restaurant selection and a great customer experience. Additionally, we facilitate mid-sized retail and e-commerce merchant access to payment processing solutions with third parties. We have multiple third-party processing relationships and our goal is to leverage their various options for the benefit of merchants operating in face-to-face, online, MOTO (mail order, telephone order), and other transactional environments. 
Restaurant Benefits
We believe that we provide restaurants with the following key benefits:
•Exposure. Our Platforms provide restaurants with access to incremental users and the opportunity to grow their consumer base. Restaurant menus are showcased on the Platforms, resulting in diners discovering restaurants they would like to visit in person, not just order on the Platforms, further expanding the potential pool of dine-in customers for restaurants.
•Incremental channels. Our Platforms provide restaurants with additional channels through which they can receive more orders, while building brand awareness, as they are discovered by more diners.
•Deep integration and customization.  We provide menu onboarding and real-time menu customization that restaurants can manage themselves.
•Service. We provide restaurants with in-market team support from our network of regional managers, territory managers and market success associates, and we provide them with a team of partner support representatives, helping to ensure the Platforms operate efficiently for the restaurants.
•Restaurant Software Platforms. The Platforms provide restaurants with actionable data on diners’ order history and trends, allowing restaurants to offer more tailored dishes and suggest more add-on items, which increases order values.
•Reliable Delivery. We connect restaurants with a network of independent contractor drivers through our wholly owned subsidiary, Delivery Logistics, LLC (“Delivery Logistics”).
Diner Benefits
We believe that we provide diners with the following key benefits:
•Selection. The restaurants on our Platforms include a mix of local independent restaurants and national chains that represent a wide array of cuisines, price points and local favorites in each market to best serve the diverse tastes of diners.
•Quality Service. We have a dedicated customer support team to assist diners, helping to ensure quick and consistent quality service when ordering on the Platforms.
•Discovery. The Platforms are designed to showcase the variety of restaurants inclusive of menus with professional photography, giving diners a rich understanding of restaurants’ offerings.
•Personalized Experience. We allow diners to tailor their orders to various layers of customization through easy-to-use Platforms. Diners can add frequent restaurants as favorites and keep track of past orders.
•Convenience. We provide diners with intuitive Platforms that make ordering and delivery simple from any connected device. Diners can track their order and know exactly when to expect their food.

Driver Benefits
•Flexibility. We provide independent contractor drivers with the opportunity to work when and how they want, based upon their individual needs. Our streamlined onboarding process allows drivers to quickly start earning on their own schedule.
Facilitation of Third-Party Payment Processing Solutions Benefits
•Cost Savings. We believe our strategic partnerships with specific point-of-sale (“POS”) systems and other processing solutions allow merchants to take advantage of less expensive options.
•Expansion of Sales Revenue and Customer Base. Our strategy is to provide access to attractive third-party payment processing solution options, as well as state-of-the-art POS systems coupled with advanced mobile smart terminals, to better serve our restaurant clients as well as other merchants. 
Business Strategy
We have historically grown our business by increasing the number of quality restaurants available on the Platforms, which has facilitated growth in diners and orders. Leveraging best practices from the launch of prior markets, we continuously refine our processes in onboarding new restaurants, deploying adequate resources to markets, sales and ongoing business development. We have focused our efforts on bringing in the logistics infrastructure to underserved populations of restaurants, grocery stores and other merchants and establishing strong market presence or leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. Our strategy is to expand our ecosystem, which today is comprised of our restaurants, diners and independent contractor drivers, through the enhancement of our platforms and providing additional products and services, including the facilitation of access to third-party payment processing services for our ecosystem. We intend to pursue the following growth strategies to grow the Platforms and our business:
Expansion into new markets, development of new products and services and investment in new technology
Our long-term business strategy includes expansion into new cities and geographies, development of new product offerings and services across our marketplace and investment in new technology, all of which should continue to enhance the user experience and service offerings of the Platforms.
Increase sales through further penetration of existing markets
We plan to continue marketing and actively building our brands in existing markets by improving our restaurant offerings and technology platform depth, continuing to enhance the quality of our customer service and increasing our presence in the local communities.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We intend to selectively evaluate and pursue expansion of both our core business and diversification opportunities through strategic acquisitions or arrangements to provide complementary offerings of products and services in both existing and any new markets, with the goal of growing our ecosystem in both size and offerings.
Deliver an excellent diner experience
We believe that by tailoring experiences on our Platforms to the nuances of local or regional markets, we should be able to improve the user experience and drive growth for our restaurant partners. We plan to invest in our direct sales teams and to add more restaurants and restaurant variety to the Platforms. We intend to continue to refine our customer support team to provide a high-quality experience to our diners. We believe significant opportunity exists to increase existing diner spend, add new diners, and further establish our market positions.
Leverage relationships with our restaurant partners
We intend to utilize our existing relationships with diverse, high-quality restaurant partners to expand our presence within our current markets as well as support in the expansion into new markets. In particular, we view the facilitating access to third-party payment processing services as a complimentary offering to both expand and strengthen our relationships with our restaurant partners.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Marketing
The Platforms are an important extension of restaurant branding. Restaurants promote Waitr, Bite Squad and Delivery Dudes as a feature for their diners through in-restaurant advertising collateral such as door stickers, table tents and push cards, and other promotional items. Our remaining sales and marketing initiatives are through paid digital marketing, social media strategies and local sponsorships. Our restaurant relationships also allow us to market third-party payment processing services and solutions.
Sales
Our sales team is constantly focused on signing restaurants across our current and target markets. By focusing our sales efforts on onboarding new restaurants and showing them the value of the Platforms, restaurants promote themselves on the Platforms to their own diner bases. This increase in diners helps to drive more sales and ultimately more orders to the Platforms. After market launch, we typically continue the sales efforts with business development managers, while also conducting sales initiatives at the regional and corporate level with key partners and larger national accounts thereby continually bolstering our restaurant base. After opening new markets, our local market and sales teams continue to work with the restaurants to increase overall order volume and ensure a high level of quality across the Platforms.
Our sales team is uniquely positioned to facilitate access to third-party payment processing services to these restaurants. We view the existing restaurant relationships as a conduit through which we can engage with our restaurant partners to understand their needs and offer additional services and products as appropriate, such as facilitating access to third-party payment processing services.
Products and Services
Restaurant Products and Services
Restaurant Onboarding. We offer restaurants a streamlined onboarding process that features direct menu management and high levels of customer service from our market level management and restaurant support team. 
Product Features. We provide restaurants with the ability to offer promotions and tailored daily specials, optimize orders through analytics and manage restaurant menus. The Platforms include a dedicated mobile application for restaurants which simplifies the aggregation of restaurant order and delivery tasks onto a central in-app controller and provides flexibility to edit menus based on inventory or promotions. This can be performed through user-friendly hardware that receives orders on-site and integrates them seamlessly into existing kitchen flow. We also provide integration with certain online ordering and point-of-sale vendors in order to further enhance our restaurant partners’ efficiency when fulfilling orders generated on our Platforms. The Platforms are also able to provide featured placement of certain restaurants within both the mobile and web applications.
Restaurant Support. We also provide restaurants with a team of support representatives to ensure timely responses to inquiries, contributing to an overall high-quality restaurant experience.
Delivery. We provide ordering and delivery Platforms for restaurants through a network of independent contractor drivers to address the growing demand for delivery services. We also provide delivery services for restaurants and other retailers who have ordering platforms without delivery.
Diner Products and Services
Features. The Platforms simplify the diner ordering process to a few steps. These include setting location, specifying delivery method, immediate or future order, selecting and customizing menu items and tracking orders until completion. Diners have search capabilities to locate a certain restaurant or search by cuisine type and can easily view their favorite restaurants and past orders.
Restaurant Selection and Customization. The restaurants on the Platforms offer diners a wide array of cuisine types, both from local independent restaurants and national chain restaurants. Our goal is to create a personalized experience for diners, where they can tailor their orders to several layers of customization: getting what they want, when they want it.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Customer Support. We also provide diners with a team of customer support representatives, which can be directly accessed through our mobile and web applications to assist with any inquiries and to ensure a high-quality diner experience.
Third-Party Payment Processing Solutions
We facilitate mid-sized retail and e-commerce merchant access to third-party payment processing solutions. We believe that pricing models obtained by merchants are value additive. Our goal is to see merchants access the best processing solution for their specific business type, which should foster growth and avoid unnecessary disruption in services.
Customers
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 26,000 restaurants on the Platforms and served approximately 1.7 million Active Diners. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, none of the restaurants on the Platforms or Active Diners accounted for 1% or more of the Company’s revenues.
We acquired the Cape Payment Companies in August 2021 and receive residual payments from third-party payment processing solution providers in connection with referral services provided. For the year ended December 31, 2021, none of the payment processing solution providers accounted for 1% or more of the Company’s revenues.
Competition
Our primary competition consists of other online ordering and delivery service providers, who compete with us for restaurants, diners and delivery drivers within the markets we serve. Over the last few years, we have experienced increased competition from well-capitalized national delivery service providers.
Additionally, we face competition from traditional offline options used by the vast majority of restaurants in our markets, including paper menus, telephone orders for delivery or takeout, and local advertising placed by restaurants. Management believes that the Company competes favorably with the traditional ordering process by aggregating restaurant and menu information on the Platforms, making it more convenient for diners to locate restaurants by proximity, cuisine type and/or price point, and efficiently placing a customized order or a repeat order for delivery or carryout, without ever having to interact directly with the restaurant. For restaurants, we offer a more targeted marketing opportunity than traditional, offline, local advertising channels, providing exposure to our network of diners, who routinely access our Platforms.
We compete with other independent sales organizations in facilitating access to third-party payment processing solutions and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do.
Impact of Recent Macroeconomic Developments and COVID-19 on our Business
We are exposed to general economic conditions that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic developments and impacts related to inflation, increased gasoline prices, the Ukrainian conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent inflationary trends that the U.S. is experiencing, as well as increased gasoline prices, affect all constituent groups in our ecosystem, including restaurants, consumers and independent contractor drivers. These groups may be negatively impacted by these economic conditions, which in turn could impact our financial position and results of operations. There is uncertainty of the duration of these recent macroeconomic conditions. 
We have thus far been able to operate effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to economic hardships experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. federal government rolled out stimulus payments in the first quarter of 2021 which we believe had a positive impact on order volumes during such period. However, we also believe the stimulus payments resulted in increased driver labor costs as we were faced with challenges in maintaining an appropriate level of driver supply. In addition, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in revenue and orders due to increased consumer demand for delivery and more restaurants using our platform to facilitate both delivery and take-out. During the second and third quarters of 2021, we believe the impact of the stimulus payments on our order volumes and consumer demand due to the pandemic began to decrease. While the widespread rollout of vaccines is leading to increased confidence that the impacts of the pandemic may be stabilizing, the spread of certain COVID variants

and cases rising in areas with low vaccination rates provide continued uncertainty as to the potential short and long-term impacts of the pandemic on the global economy and on the Company’s business, in particular. There remains uncertainty as to whether or not the pandemic will continue to impact diner, restaurant and driver behavior, and if so, in what manner. 
To the extent that macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased gasoline prices, the Ukrainian conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Form 10-K. Management continues to monitor the impact of recent macroeconomic trends and the COVID-19 outbreak and the possible effects on its financial position, liquidity, operations, industry and workforce. 
Seasonality and Holidays
Our business tends to follow restaurant closure and diner behavior patterns with respect to demand of our service offering. In many of our markets, we have historically experienced variations in order frequency as a result of weather patterns, university summer breaks and other vacation periods. In addition, a significant number of restaurants tend to close on certain major holidays, including Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, among others. Further, diner activity may be impacted by unusually cold, rainy, or warm weather. Cold weather and rain typically drive increases in order volume, while unusually warm or sunny weather typically drives decreases in orders. Furthermore, severe weather-related events such as snowstorms, ice storms, hurricanes and tropical storms have adverse effects on order volume, particularly if they cause property damage or utility interruptions to our restaurant partners. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the federal government’s responses thereto, have had an impact on our typical seasonality trends and could impact these trends in future periods.
Technology and Intellectual Property
Our Platforms use scalable software to provide a consistent and robust user experience as user adoption increases. The internally developed Platforms are purpose-built to streamline online ordering and fulfillment for consumers and restaurants. The Platforms are 100% hosted in the cloud. Cloud hosting assists us with addressing potential capacity constraints that we may face as we grow our core applications and provide a level of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost effectiveness.
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights.
As of December 31, 2021, we had registered trademarks covering “Waitr”, “Bite Squad” and “Delivery Dudes” and the stylistic designs associated with our brands. We have also filed other trademark applications in the United States and may pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent management believes it will benefit the business and be cost effective. In June 2021, the Company entered into a License, Release and Settlement Agreement to settle all claims related to a lawsuit related to alleged trademark infringement based on the Company’s use of the “Waitr” trademark and logo. In connection therewith, the Company agreed to adopt a new trademark or tradename to replace the Waitr trademark by June 22, 2022, unless extended by eight additional months in exchange for a one-time payment of $800,000. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional details. 
We hold several registrations to domain names relating to our business, including waitrapp.com, bitesquad.com, deliverydudes.com and others. In 2021, we acquired the domain name ASAP.com, along with several other related domain names, in connection with our planned comprehensive rebranding initiative. 
As of December 31, 2021, we filed two patent applications in the United States, which seek to cover proprietary inventions relating to our products and services. We may pursue further patents to the extent that management believes it will benefit Waitr’s business and be cost effective.
Our employees are required to maintain proprietary and non-public information confidential and to assign any and all inventions or other intellectual property relating to the business to Waitr. The policies and applicable terms of use of the Platforms also contain confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property provisions and restrict the distribution or use of the Company’s technology in unauthorized manners. Additionally, we enter into confidentiality agreements with consultants and contractors who are given access to confidential information about the Company.

Government Regulation
Our industry and business model are relatively new, have been evolving, and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the adoption and application of regulation. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, and local ordinances in the jurisdictions in which we operate and they are also evolving and difficult to predict. These include laws and regulations relating to (i) pricing and fee structures, (ii) food safety, (iii) labor and employment, (iv) acceptance of credit card payments and consumer protection, (v) website and mobile application accessibility, security, and data privacy, (vi) alcoholic beverages, (vii) background checks, (viii) taxes, and (ix) other regulated matters. These laws, regulations, and ordinances can be subject to interpretation and can lack certainty and specificity relative to our business. In many cases, it may be unclear whether certain of these regulatory schemes apply to our business and how best to navigate potential differing standards, interpretations, and even conflicts among the different governmental authorities who adopt and enforce such regulation.
Recent political, financial, and world events may have the effect of increasing scrutiny on technology companies and on gig economy enterprises reliant on an independent contractor workforce. Governmental entities have enacted, and may enact, new measures that are adverse to our business, like measures capping commissions charged to restaurant merchants that have been recently enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in several state and city jurisdictions. Certain larger cities have recently enacted permanent regulations capping commissions charged to restaurant merchants and it is unclear whether this is a growing trend. As a result, we may be forced to either increase fees to consumers, if legally permitted, reduce our margins and profitability in such jurisdictions, or cease providing services in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing our geographic footprint and expansion opportunities. We may also be compelled to expend significant resources or discontinue certain services or features which could adversely affect our business.
While we hope to continue to expand and make our technology platforms broadly available, these laws, regulations, and ordinances may limit our ability to expand geographically or require us to expend significant resources to modify our platforms, systems, or alter our business model in order to do so. Further, if we are unable to comply with regulation imposed upon our business, we could be subject to regulatory proceedings, fines or other penalties, along with potential civil and criminal proceedings. Finally, such proceedings could become the focus of increased media attention or other negative impacts on our brand identity or our public relations initiatives, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 845 employees. We also engage consultants as needed. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with the Company. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Our success depends upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified management and other key operating and technology personnel. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals. We consider talented management a very important factor in our ability to drive our strategic initiatives and execute our long-term growth strategy and appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture which values equality and respect. Our employees are offered competitive compensation and benefits programs, as well as opportunities for career growth and development. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
The recruitment of qualified independent contractor drivers by Delivery Logistics is an important part of our success. Independent contractor drivers are provided with a streamlined onboarding process and educational opportunities that help to maximize their earnings potential. Maintaining a diverse network of independent contractor drivers is important to us. We are committed to our independent contractor drivers having the tools and resources needed to ensure they provide exceptional customer service.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to implement safety measures to protect and support our restaurant partners, diners and independent contractor drivers. Additionally, we have allowed our employees to work remotely as appropriate, while implementing safety measures designed to protect the health of all those entering our facilities.

Corporate History
Waitr Incorporated began operations in 2014 in Lake Charles, Louisiana as a restaurant platform for online ordering and delivery services, and grew quickly, connecting restaurants and diners in various markets. Landcadia Holdings, Inc. was a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) whose business was to effect a business combination. The November 2018 merger between Waitr Incorporated and Landcadia Holdings, Inc. (the “Landcadia Business Combination”) provided a platform for Waitr Incorporated to gain access to the U.S. public markets. Prior to the consummation of the Landcadia Business Combination, the common equity of the SPAC was traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “LCA”. Effective November 2018, the Company’s common equity began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “WTRH”.
In January 2019, Waitr acquired BiteSquad.com, LLC (“Bite Squad”). Founded in 2012 and based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bite Squad operates an online ordering platform with operations similar to those of Waitr. The acquisition of Bite Squad (the “Bite Squad Merger”) expanded the Company’s scale and footprint across the United States. In March 2021, Waitr completed the acquisition of Delivery Dudes, a third-party delivery business primarily serving the South Florida market (the “Delivery Dudes Acquisition”). In August 2021, Waitr completed the acquisition of the Cape Payment Companies, which are in the business of facilitating merchant access to third-party payment processing solution providers (the “Cape Payment Acquisition”). 
Basis of Presentation
The Bite Squad Merger, Delivery Dudes Acquisition and Cape Payment Acquisition were considered business combinations, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and have been accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total merger consideration, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of merger consideration over the fair value of the assets less liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates.
