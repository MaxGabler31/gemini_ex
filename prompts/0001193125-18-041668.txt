Item 1.  Business. 
General 
 Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 17 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of four drillships and seven ultra-deepwater, four deepwater and two mid-water semisubmersible rigs. The semisubmersible Ocean Victory was sold in January 2018 and the jack-up Ocean Scepter is currently being marketed for sale. Both rigs have been excluded from our current fleet total. See  Our Fleet  Fleet Enhancements and Additions and  Our Fleet  Fleet Status. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to Diamond Offshore, we, us or our mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. 
 Our Fleet 
 Our fleet enables us to offer services in the floater market on a worldwide basis. A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. 
 Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a semi-submerged position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning, or DP, to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the sea bed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations. 
 A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs. 
 Our floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal water depth for each class of rig as follows: 
 

Category | Rated Water Depth (a) (in feet) | Number of Units in Our Fleet
Ultra-Deepwater | 7,501 to 12,000 | 11 
Deepwater | 5,000 to 7,500 | 4 
Mid-Water | 400 to 4,999 | 2 


(a) | Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

 Fleet Enhancements and Additions. Our long-term strategy is to upgrade our fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices. Our most recent fleet enhancement cycle was completed in 2016, with the delivery of the Ocean GreatWhite. 
 We continue to evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However, we can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, we will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to our fleet. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Sources and Uses of Cash  Capital Expenditures in Item 7 of this report. 
 Pressure Control by the Hour®. In 2016, we launched an initiative to increase the operational efficiency of our rigs by reducing subsea non-productive time, or downtime incurred by a contracted rig due to the performance of routine 
 
3 


  maintenance on or failure of subsea equipment, primarily the blowout preventer, or BOP. As part of this initiative, we entered into a ten-year collaborative arrangement with a subsidiary of GE Oil & Gas, or GE, to monitor the BOP equipment and proactively manage the maintenance, certification and reliability of such equipment. In connection with the services agreement with GE, we sold the BOP equipment to a GE affiliate and have leased back such equipment under four separate ten-year operating leases. Collectively, we refer to the services agreement with GE and the lease agreements with the GE affiliate as the PCbtH program. At the end of 2016, all of our drillships were participants in the PCbtH program. Since the fourth quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2017, the operational efficiency of our drillships has increased from 95.1% to 99.7%.

 Offshore Contract Drilling Services 
 Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. We typically obtain our contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for us to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Our drilling contracts generally provide for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, we generally pay the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of our revenues. In addition, from time to time, our dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from our customer based upon performance. 
 The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, in what we refer to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what we refer to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost, or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of our contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term 
 
4 


  contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. See Risk Factors  We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs and Risk Factors  Our business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us, in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. For a discussion of our contract backlog, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Market Overview  Contract Drilling Backlog in Item 7 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Customers 
 We provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we performed services for 14, 18 and 19 different customers, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, our most significant customers were as follows: 

 | Percentage of AnnualConsolidated Revenues | 
Customer | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Anadarko | | 24.9 | % | | 22.4 | % | 12.4 | %
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. | | 18.9 | % | | 17.9 | % | 24.1 | %
Hess Corporation | | 16.0 | % | | 7.7 | % | 0.3 | %
BP | | 15.8 | % | | 9.0 | % | 0.1 | %
ExxonMobil | |  | | | 5.8 | % | 12.4 | %

 No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our annual total consolidated revenues during 2017, 2016 or 2015. See Risk Factors  Our industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition and Risk Factors  Our customer base is concentrated in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 As of January 1, 2018, our contract backlog was $2.4 billion attributable to 13 customers. All four of our drillships are currently contracted to work in the GOM. As of January 1, 2018, contract backlog attributable to our expected operations in the GOM was $653.0 million, $554.0 million and $86.0 million for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, all of which was attributable to two customers. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Market Overview  Contract Drilling Backlog in Item 7 of this report. See Risk Factors  We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized in Item 1A of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Competition 
 Based on industry data, as of the date of this report, there are approximately 800 mobile drilling rigs in service worldwide, including approximately 260 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do. 
 Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractors operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 
 We compete on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. See  Markets. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore 
 
5 


  drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current oversupply of offshore drilling rigs also intensifies price competition. See Risk Factors  Our industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition in Item 1A of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Governmental Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. See Risk Factors  We are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
Operations Outside the United States 
 Our operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 58%, 66% and 79% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Risk Factors  Significant portions of our operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with United States domestic operations and Risk Factors  We may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of our foreign earnings in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,400 workers, including international crew personnel furnished through independent labor contractors.
