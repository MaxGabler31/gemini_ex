Item 1. Business
Company Overview

Lexaria Bioscience Corp. is a biotechnology company developing the enhancement of the bioavailability of a broad range of fat-soluble active molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) using our patented DehydraTECHTM drug delivery technology. DehydraTECH combines lipophilic molecules or APIs with specific long-chain fatty acids and carrier compounds that improve the way they enter the bloodstream, increasing their effectiveness and allowing for lower overall dosing while promoting healthier oral ingestion methods. 

DehydraTECH can be used with a wide range of active molecules encompassing fat-soluble vitamins, pain medications, hormones, PDE5 inhibitors, antivirals, nicotine and its analogs, and all cannabinoids. Our technology can be applied to a variety of therapeutic indications, including hypertension and heart disease, dementia, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS. DehydraTECH can be implemented in a multitude of ingestible or topically administered product formats including foods, beverages, oral suspensions, tablets, capsules, creams, lotions, and skin patches. It is suitable for use with a variety of product formats including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, over-the-counter and consumer packaged goods. 

DehydraTECH is a technology incorporated into the formulation and manufacturing process of new or existing orally ingestible and topical products. The procedure involves fusing the active ingredient as a delivery “payload” together with certain fatty acids and infusing the mixture into a substrate material. Using controlled dehydration synthesis, it combines the payload and fatty acids together at a molecular level. The newly combined molecules are then integrated into production of the end-product using any number of dosage formats. From foods and beverages to cosmetics and nutraceuticals, this technology extends across many product categories beyond the primary pharmaceutical focus of the Company. DehydraTECH formulations have been found to reduce the need for unwanted sweeteners or chemical masking agents used for flavor and odor blocking allowing manufacturers to create low-sugar products with fewer calories and artificial sweeteners.

The Company has developed a variety of demonstration products since 2015 exhibiting the potential uses for DehydraTECH to both consumers and potential licensees. These products included hot chocolate, coffee, seven flavors of teas, two flavors of protein energy bars, powder filled capsules and mix-and-serve powders. All utilized DehydraTECH for a more palatable and efficient delivery of bioactive molecules. The Company gained extensive experience from the formulation and production of these products that enables us to provide expert advice to our licensees with the integration of DehydraTECH in their products.

Lexaria does not intend to create or produce consumer products. A part of our business plan is to encourage new and existing participants to license and utilize DehydraTECH to enable enhanced performance of their products. These products cross a wide range of lipophilic bioactive molecules including CBD with additional molecules of interest continually being evaluated.

Intellectual Property

DehydraTECH dates back to 2014 with two initial US provisional patent application filings made by the original inventors Poppy’s Teas LLC, which Lexaria acquired by way of exclusive, worldwide license rights to DehydraTECH via the acquisition of the controlling interest in the founding company. In 2015, Lexaria signed a license agreement with PoViva Corp. (formerly PoViva Tea LLC) granting Lexaria a 35-year non-exclusive worldwide license to unencumbered use of PoViva Tea LLC’s intellectual property rights, including rights of resale. This license agreement ensures Lexaria has full access to the underlying infusion technology. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted our first patent on October 31, 2017. In 2019, the licence agreement was updated granting Lexaria an exclusive license to use DehydraTECH technology for a period of time ending 25 years after the date of the last patent granted to PoViva Corp. Since our first patent filing in 2014 for DehydraTECH, we have increased the number of patent applications to more than 50 and to date have been allowed/granted 27 patents worldwide as of the date of this filing. Our pursuit and development of our technology has expanded our potential area of impact, both geographically and by sector. Because of the applicability of DehydraTECH to many market sectors across the globe, we have taken the necessary steps to protect that intellectual property internationally.

Lexaria has patents granted or patent applications progressing in countries around the world with aggregate populations of nearly 4 billion people. We pursue international patent protection through filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, followed by national filings. Our global patent portfolio now stands at 27 and we have more than 50 patent applications filed in over 40 jurisdictions which are considered as having the highest commercial potential. The patents and patent applications apply to fat-soluble versions of vitamins, NSAIDs, nicotine, cannabinoids, hormones, PDE5 inhibitors, antivirals, and other molecules. Several of our patent families include intellectual property addressing the manufacturing and processing methods used to combine long-chain fatty acids with active pharmaceutical ingredients.

In addition, while ten of our US patents and nine of our Australian patents have been granted to date, we now have received granted patents in the European Union, Japan, India and Mexico, and have multiple other applications filed in the US and around the world. It is not possible to forecast with certainty when, or if, our remaining patents pending will become granted patents. We will continue to pursue our remaining patents pending as vigorously as we are able, since the successful granting of more of those applications could lead to material increases in shareholder value. If our remaining patent applications do become granted patents, our ability to generate meaningful license revenue from our intellectual property may increase from multiple jurisdictions outside of the US. 

Our current patent portfolio includes patent family applications or grants pertaining to Lexaria’s method of improving bioavailability and taste, and the use of DehydraTECH as a delivery platform for a wide variety of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) encompassing all cannabinoids; fat soluble vitamins; NSAIDs pain medications; and nicotine and its analogs. The Company currently has more than 50 patent applications pending worldwide and due to the complexity of pursuing patent protection, the quantity of patent applications will vary continuously as each application advances or stalls. We continue to investigate national and international opportunities to investigate expansions and additions to our intellectual property portfolio. Patents have been filed specifically for the use of DehydraTECH with cannabinoids for the treatment of heart disease.

Lexaria is also filing new patent applications for new discoveries that arise from the Company’s R&D programs. We will continue to seek beneficial acquisitions of intellectual property if and when we believe it is advisable to do so. Due to the inherent unpredictability of scientific discovery, it is not possible to predict if or how often such new applications might be filed or patents issued. 

The substance of the patents centre on the use of DehydraTECH in a variety of products including those that are ingested or topically administered such as CBD, food, beverage, patches, creams, lotions et cetera. Patents have been filed (and granted in both Australia and the EU) specifically for the use of DehydraTECH with cannabinoids for the treatment of heart disease. The pending and granted patents also cover the manufacturing and processing methods used to combine fatty acids with active pharmaceutical ingredients. This includes heating and drying methods and use of excipients and substrates. Below we summarize Lexaria’s allowed/granted patents.

Patents granted in the year ended August 31, 2022

In fiscal 2022, the Company’s patent portfolio expanded to include three new patent families. This further protects our exclusivity in the use of DehydraTECH with nicotine and antiviral agents, in compositions that have a reduced food effect and for delivery of lipophilic active agents via transdermal or dermal delivery. These patents are as follows:


· | our first ever patent granted in our 8th patent family, to use DehydraTECH to more efficiently deliver nicotine through buccal tissue absorption. The new Australian patent entitled “Compositions Infused with Nicotine Compounds and Methods of Use Thereof” expands upon Lexaria’s international intellectual property rights to apply DehydraTECH enhancement technology to most oral forms of nicotine, including pills, tablets, lozenges, capsules, pouches, gums and sprays. The patent covers many different forms of nicotine including free base nicotine, nicotine salts, polymer resins of nicotine and other forms of nicotine complexes.

· | our first-ever patent granted in our 18th patent family, to use DehydraTECH in the enhanced delivery of antiviral drugs, in the United States. The new US patent entitled “Compositions and Methods For Enhanced Delivery Of Antiviral Agents” expands upon Lexaria’s international intellectual property rights to apply DehydraTECH enhancement technology with antiviral drugs where our research has shown that antiviral drugs processed with DehydraTECH were able to reach peak blood concentration levels that were double those of non-DehydraTECH-processed; and overall volumes of drug delivered into bloodstream were up to triple the amount compared to non-DehydraTECH-processed drugs. 
· | our first ever patent granted in our 7th patent family which recognizes DehydraTECH’s ability to deliver API’s more efficiently regardless of the presence of foods within the gastrointestinal system, in Japan. The new Japan patent entitled “Lipophilic Active Agent Infused Compositions With Reduced Food Effect” recognizes the important achievement in reliable drug dosing resulting from DehydraTECH’s ability to deliver drugs more consistently into the bloodstream regardless of the presence of food in the gastrointestinal system. 
· | our first Mexican patent in our third patent family, “Stable Ready-to-Drink Beverage Compositions Comprising Lipophilic Active Agents” from which patents have already been issued in Australia, India, and Japan. The patent is applicable to a range of active ingredients that includes but is not limited to non-psychoactive cannabinoids and NSAIDs. Types of products covered include certain pharmaceutical product formats as well as a wide variety of ready-to-drink consumer retail beverage products. Additional claims granted include the treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): dementia; obesity; metabolic disorders such as insulin related deficiencies and lipid profiles, hepatic diseases, diabetes, and appetite disorders; cancer chemotherapy; benign prostatic hypertrophy; irritable bowel syndrome; biliary diseases; ovarian disorders; marijuana abuse; and alcohol, opioid, nicotine or cocaine addiction.

Research and Development

Lexaria incurred $1,842,675 (2021- $1,262,895) in R&D expenditures during fiscal 2022. Specific programs are in ongoing development and are prioritized relative to our financial and operational ability to undertake each research phase for specific APIs. Due to our expanding portfolio coverage, we continue to explore accelerated timetable options for testing, research and further development. 

The Company regularly pursues new R&D programs that investigate potential commercial applications for the incorporation of DehydraTECH. These include, but are not limited to, ongoing programs to explore methods to integrate nano emulsification chemistry techniques together with DehydraTECH that have demonstrated positive results to date, programs to further enhance intestinal bio absorption rates with DehydraTECH, as well as ongoing programs to expand the types and breadth of product form factors into which DehydraTECH can be applied. Depending on the number of programs undertaken, R&D budgets are expected to vary significantly. It is in our best interests to remain flexible at this early stage of our R&D efforts in order to capitalize on potential novel findings from early-stage tests and thus redirect research into specific avenues that offer the most reward.

Lexaria has conducted a number of pharmacokinetic studies designed to provide potential early-stage indications of enhancing delivery characteristics of various drugs for potential future use. Our first human clinical study was published in 2019 (Advances in Therapy titled “Examination of a New Delivery Approach for Oral Cannabidiol in Healthy Subjects: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Pharmacokinetics Study”-see PubMed.gov website: PMID: 31512143), where we demonstrated that DehydraTECH delivered higher volumes of CBD into the human circulatory system and did so more quickly than a concentration-matched positive control. The study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in human blood pressure (“BP”) from the DehydraTECH processed CBD, versus no statistical reduction in human blood pressure from the positive control. The results of this study significantly influenced the direction of Lexaria’s research and development of its DehydraTECH technology.

During fiscal 2022 Lexaria marked significant milestones in utilizing DehydraTECH-processed cannabidiol (“CBD”) for investigation of heart disease and hypertension; and separately, for oral nicotine delivery as a non-combusted, reduced-risk alternative to smoking. The following studies are the most recent contributors to our applied R&D programs. These studies have been entirely funded through the Company’s existing cash resources. 

HYPER-H21-1

During the spring of 2021 Lexaria commenced its human clinical study HYPER-H21-1 with the intent to validate DehydraTECH-CBD’s effect on hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled study with 24 subjects aged 45-65 and enrolled with symptoms of either pre-hypertension or mild hypertension. A single 300 mg dose of a DehydraTECH 2.0 CBD formulation was compared against a non-DehydraTECH control of matched concentration. Time series blood pressure and heart rate analyses were the primary objectives of the study. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic speed and rate of absorption of CBD and its main metabolites together with assessment of inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease and nitric oxide biomarkers. The Company noted that the DehydraTECH-CBD treatment was well tolerated by the volunteers with no serious adverse events or side effects observed or reported. Early results disclosed in July 2021 noted a difference between the DehydraTECH-CBD formulation and the control arm at the 20-minute mark that was statistically significant (p=0.025).

HYPER-A21-1

Animal study HYPER-A21-1, an animal study utilized three new “DehydraTECH 2.0” formulation variations designed to enable CBD delivery performance enhancements and pharmacokinetic optimization. All three new formulations delivered improved performance when compared to both Lexaria’s original DehydraTECH 1.0 and 2.0 concentration-matched formulations, as well as to a medium chain triglyceride (“MCT”) oil based control formulation representative of standard industry practices. The study demonstrated that each of the new DehydraTECH 2.0 formulations delivered very high levels of CBD absorption into brain tissues, dwarfing the levels achieved with the MCT oil-based control formulation. The three new DehydraTECH 2.0 formulations delivered between 907%-1,737% more CBD into brain tissue than the MCT oil-based control formulation, similar to the up to 1,937% increase over the MCT oil based control formulation announced previously for Lexaria’s original DehydraTECH 2.0 formulation.

HYPER-H21-2

Dosing was completed in July of 2021 in our second human clinical study in 2021which was conducted at a European medical research hospital and designated as HYPER-H21-2. On September 7, 2021, Lexaria announced the results which evaluated 16 volunteers (8 male; 8 female) aged 45-65 who were pre or mildly hypertensive and received three separate doses of 150mg DehydraTECH 2.0 CBD versus placebo. The study concentrated on monitoring blood pressure reduction continuously over 24 hours and studying central arterial stiffness, physical activity, and sleep quality.

At selected times during the 24-hour study, volunteers with mild to moderate hypertension averaged as much as a 20 mmHg (i.e., 23%) decrease in BP relative to placebo. Over the 24-hour ambulatory monitoring period, volunteers averaged a significant reduction of 7.0% (p < 0.001) in systolic pressure with DehydraTECH-CBD relative to placebo. The study indicated that, within a 24 hour period, DehydraTECH 2.0 CBD provided a significant reduction of 3.5% in diastolic pressure relative to an increase in diastolic pressure from baseline. This is a substantial discovery as existing drugs for hypertension typically take several weeks before comparable blood pressure reductions are seen.

Further results from the study were announced on December 8, 2021, whereby DehydraTECH 2.0 CBD was also found to reduce arterial stiffness after only one day of dosing which could have the potential as a treatment for cardiovascular and other disease. This potentially broadens its application to treatment of cardiovascular and other disease states beyond hypertension where it has already shown promise. 

HYPER-H21-3

Final results from HYPER-H21-3 illustrated DehydraTECH CBD’s ability to reduce blood pressure pursuant to a simulated pulmonary hypertension scenario. The study was successfully completed with positive safety and efficacy findings. Findings indicated a tendency (p=0.1) during 15 minutes of simulated low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) for reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (“PASP”) with DehydraTECH-CBD treatment versus placebo. Most notably, PASP was significantly attenuated by about 5 mmHg or 41% overall (p=0.045) in male participants specifically suggesting differences by sex in responsiveness to CBD treatment under hypoxic stress conditions.

Study HYPER-H21-3 used a placebo-controlled and double-blinded design, with administration of a single 300mg dose of a specific DehydraTECH-2.0 CBD formulation compared to placebo in a target group of sixteen enrolled volunteers (8 females and 8 males; aged 18-35 years). The study participants were subjected to a 30-minute period of rest following dosing, during which time they breathed normal room air (i.e., 21% oxygen), followed by a 40-minute period of simulated hypoxia (i.e., 12% oxygen) that was induced in order to safely simulate robust hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (“HPV”) and, as a result, an acute state of pulmonary hypertension. The hypoxia state was intended to mimic conditions experienced by those traveling or walking at high altitude or by those engaging in other activities of diminished oxygen availability conducive to development of HPV. Adverse elevations in HPV also commonly occur in related hypoxemic pathologies (e.g., severe lung disease) and pulmonary hypertension. Measurements of PASP were performed via echocardiography at intervals of 15 and 30 minutes during the 40-minute hypoxic period comparing the effects of DehydraTECH-CBD to placebo.

HYPER-H21-4

HYPER-H21-4 is the most ambitious study Lexaria has ever undertaken and is enabled from the successful outcomes from our other 2021 human hypertension studies. This study was intended to “de-risk” outcomes prior to Lexaria’s planned entry into formal investigational new drug (“IND”) regulatory pathways for the use of DehydraTECH-CBD to treat hypertension and possibly other forms of cardiovascular disease. The study protocols were approved by the Independent Review Board in December 2021 with the program commencing in April 2022 and dosing completion in July 2022. The primary efficacy outcome from the study was the data related to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Secondary study outcomes included: vascular health including arterial stiffness and autonomic balance; electrocardiogram analysis; brain structure and function through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing; blood biomarkers (including renal, hepatic inflammation, lipids such as cholesterol); sleep quality / daytime sleepiness / sleep disorders; actigraphy, geriatric depression scale, perceived stress, and Beck anxiety inventory.

The study consisted of 66 volunteers between the ages of 40-70 and used a double blinded, randomized cross-over design, which utilized a placebo control. Some volunteers were recruited who were using hypertension drugs such as ACE inhibitors, with or without diuretics, to help evaluate the efficacy of DehydraTECH CBD with and without other hypertension treatments.. 

Large quantities of data have been gathered since the inception of the study with data analyses beginning in September 2022 as results became available from ongoing bioanalyses of biological samples collected during the study. Each of these sets of data may lead to additional applications for DehydraTECH-CBD. For example, the MRI data may assist one of the secondary outcome measurements in the study to evaluate possible positive effects upon brain structure and function; and the detailed psychometric testing may reveal new insights into the potential benefits for mental health. The wide range of data collection could provide additional insights into the long-term health benefits of DehydraTECH-CBD that might otherwise remain undetected.

In December of 2021 the Independent Review Board approval was received and the program began in April 2022 with dosing with DehydraTECH-CBD completed in July 2022. In October 2022 Lexaria announced initial findings from HYPER-H21-4 evidencing a sustained drop in blood pressure (BP) in normally active hypertensive patients following multiple weeks of oral CBD therapy, using Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH-CBD capsule formulation. The primary safety and efficacy objectives of study were successfully achieved. BP was significantly reduced by 2.5 weeks and was sustained over the full 5-weeks of dosing using relatively low doses of CBD (as compared to other regulator approved pharmaceutical CBD applications) as a direct result of the well-established drug delivery efficiencies of Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology. These reductions in BP were achieved with zero serious adverse events being reported. Also, there were no adverse changes observed in liver enzymes which is an important clinical safety biomarker of oral CBD therapy. Of note, these significant decreases in BP were achieved using relatively low doses of DehydraTECH-CBD as a direct result of the well-established drug delivery efficiencies of Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology. 

There were no serious adverse events to reported as a result of the program dosing. This demonstrates a noteworthy safety and tolerability profile relative to conventional anti-hypertensive medications. This is a major achievement for Lexaria as avoiding serious adverse events at clinically efficacious doses will be a primary requirement to achieve eventual regulatory marketing authorizations.

Another important discovery from study HYPER-H21-4 was that the decreases in BP were similar in persons currently being treated with standard of care BP medications as in persons who were not undergoing any current standard of care BP treatment. This observation is suggestive that Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-CBD has the potential to offer additive BP reduction benefits on top of any degree of improvements the standard of care medications achieved for those patients before entry into the study. This additive improvement as an adjunct therapy, together with the exceptional safety profile of DehydraTECH-CBD, could become a significant value enhancer should it eventually enter the marketplace as an approved hypertension treatment. As expected, the study produced an enormous amount of data that is initially supportive of Lexaria’s plans to enter regulatory pathways under IND with a view to eventual regulatory approval to use DehydraTECH-CBD to treat hypertension if successful. Additional study endpoint analyses as described in the complete study protocol are ongoing and any relevant material findings will be reported upon in due course as these findings become available.

Cannabidiol: EPIL-A21-1

In March 2022, Lexaria commenced an initial animal study to determine if DehydraTECH-CBD evidences superior treatment of seizure activity when compared to Epidiolex. Epidiolex is an FDA-approved oral solution prescription CBD available to children 1 year of age and older to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex. In September 2019, Epidiolex was approved for use in all 27 member countries of the European Union. Epidiolex was developed by GW Pharmaceuticals plc and is now sold by Jazz Pharmaceuticals subsequent to their 2021 takeover of GW Pharmaceuticals. Epidiolex’s effectiveness was studied in three randomized clinical trials involving a total of 516 patients and was shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of seizures when compared to placebo.

Lexaria’s animal study is being conducted by a leading US-based independent laboratory using advanced DehydraTECH 2.0 formulations and is fully funded through existing Lexaria resources. Lexaria hopes to demonstrate similar or superior levels of efficacy based on the known advanced drug delivery capabilities of DehydraTECH. Lexaria’s seizure program expects to leverage the significant gains in systemic delivery and brain uptake that the Company has evidenced from other studies comparing DehydraTECH 2.0 CBD formulations with concentration-matched controls. 

THC-A21-1

In the first quarter of 2022, Lexaria announced the results from its tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) animal study which compared DehydraTECH-enhanced THC with concentration matched controls. We discovered that DehydraTECH-enhanced THC delivery into the blood plasma occurred within 15 minutes of oral ingestion as compared to parallel levels of THC delivery into blood plasma occurring at 45 minutes for the concentration matched controls. Furthermore, DehydraTECH-THC delivered more THC into the bloodstream than the industry standard medium chain triglyceride (“MCT” or “coconut oil”) based control formulation from the 2-minute mark onwards, then dropped to the same level as the MCT control by the 6-hour mark. 

Estradiol: HOR-A22-1

Lexaria began a tolerability and PK pilot study in animals using a DehydraTECH-estrogen composition in an effort to determine if absorption enhancement following oral administration was possible. After commencing this study work, our third-party laboratory performing the study concluded that the bioanalytical methodology employed required modification in order to adequately detect and quantify estrogen analytes in the animal bloodstream. Methodological optimization is in progress, following which blood plasma samples will be analysed and results reported.
Ibuprofen and Naproxen: NSAID-A21-1

The Company commenced a tolerability pilot study in animals evaluating DehydraTECH-processed formulations of ibuprofen and naproxen in an effort to determine if dosing evidenced superior gastrointestinal tolerability comparing Lexaria’s DehydraTECH test articles to concentration-matched controls. The study was undertaken based on the possibility that DehydraTECH-processed NSAIDs might achieve higher bioavailability and brain uptake than conventional formulations and, in turn, be able to be used at lower dosage levels in order to lower unwanted side effects. Our results saw some indications of less stomach ulcerations with our DehydraTECH formulations although the findings were generally unremarkable. As a result, no further research on NSAIDs is currently contemplated although this may be revisited. 
Sildenafil: PDE5-A21-1

PDE5-A21-1 was an animal PK study conducted by third-party laboratories to evaluate DehydraTECH processing of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor (“PDE5 inhibitor”) sildenafil for potential application in the management of erectile dysfunction. PDE5 inhibitor drugs work using a process of vasodilation and most are considered to be slow-acting, requiring 1-2 hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream for maximum effectiveness.

Lexaria announced the results of our comparison study in February 2022 of DehydraTECH enhanced sildenafil with concentration matched controls. It was discovered that DehydraTECH-enhanced sildenafil delivered 74% more sildenafil into the bloodstream in as little as four minutes when compared to the concentration-matched, generic control formulation. This clear trend toward faster and higher overall delivery of sildenafil into the bloodstream was evidenced over the course of the study. Seven minutes after dosing, the DehydraTECH-sildenafil formulation achieved an average blood level higher than the generic sildenafil control formulation reached at any point during the study.

Viral-A20-3

In July of 2021, we released the positive results of our completed tolerability and pharmacokinetic animal study VIRAL-A20-3 which enhanced colchicine with DehydraTECH. This study was performed by an independent, premier animal testing laboratory located in the United States using 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, dosed via oral gavage using either DehydraTECH or control colchicine formulations (i.e. 10 rats per test article). The study evaluated peak concentration (“Maximum Concentration” or “Cmax”) and total drug delivery into the rodent bloodstream (“Area Under the Curve” or “AUClast”).

Similar to other antiviral agents that Lexaria has processed with DehydraTECH (e.g., darunavir, efavirenz, remdesivir’s nucleoside analogue GS-441524 and ebastine), oral colchicine in its available forms today exhibits diminished bioavailability (approximately 45%) in humans. This study demonstrated that DehydraTECH enabled colchicine, benefited from our proprietary formulation and processing, resulting in increased delivery. 

Colchicine is an approved therapeutic with anti-inflammatory effects that is principally used to treat gout and conditions such as cardiac inflammation (i.e., pericarditis), and also has potent effects in mitigating the cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Colchicine is occasionally recommended and used to treat emergent pericarditis in children in cases where this form of cardiac inflammation develops following administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, meaning the distinction between toxic and non-toxic doses is marginal, there could be significant benefits in dosage reduction through the use of DehydraTECH, while maintaining therapeutic delivery levels.

Diabetes: DIAB-A22-1

DIAB-A22-1, is a 56-day animal program undertaken by a third-party testing laboratory located in Canada to explore the ability of DehydraTECH-CBD to potentially affect treatment of diabetes. The laboratory work is expected to complete in the second quarter of calendar 2023 with data and reporting to follow thereafter. Lexaria is exploring the use of DehydraTECH-CBD for the treatment of diabetes due to its evidenced the safety and efficacy of DehydraTECH-CBD in human hypertension studies and the strong connections between heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Diabetes is a disease whereby the body does not produce sufficient insulin, leading to higher-than-normal levels of sugars in the blood. Risks of kidney disease, vision loss, heart and cardiovascular disease and more are greatly enhanced by sufferers of diabetes. Because diabetes is often closely connected to obesity, it is a chronic and growing problem around much of the world.
Dementia: DEM-A22-1 

Lexaria has evidenced the efficacy of DehydraTECH-CBD in human hypertension studies with no serious side effects. The connections between hypertension and dementia have been established in recent clinical studies. Individuals who have high blood pressure are more likely to develop vascular dementia, which is the second most common form of dementia following Alzheimer’s disease. Dementia is a term describing the loss over time of cognitive abilities related to memory, language, problem solving abilities and behaviour. Certain trials are underway to investigate the use of nicotine for possible utility related to dementia, where some clinical success has already been reported. Others have conducted research evidencing therapeutic potential of cannabinoids including CBD in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and accounts for at least 60% of all cases, and nicotine is showing promising results related to its treatment. According to the World Health Organization, 55 million people are currently suffering from dementia with roughly 10 million additional people being diagnosed each year, with 78 million expected to be living with some form of dementia by 2030. Drugs used to treat dementia represented a $15.5 billion market in 2021, expected to double to a $32.3 billion annual market by 2030, in part due to the generally aging populations.

Lexaria has previously demonstrated in animal studies that DehydraTECH-CBD crosses the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) much more effectively than originally thought possible. Given the propensity of DehydraTECH-CBD to cross the BBB; the established fact that DehydraTECH-CBD lowers human blood pressure; and the fact that CBD is known to act with vasodilation properties, we intend to investigate whether DehydraTECH-CBD might have some positive effect on dementia. This efficacy animal study, DEM-A22-1 will evaluate if DehydraTECH-CBD may potentially have therapeutic utility against dementia. The laboratory work is expected to complete in second quarter of 2023. Depending on the outcomes, Lexaria is considering additional studies that might utilize either DehydraTECH-processed nicotine alone or in combination with CBD. 

Rheumatic Diseases: RHEUM-A22-1

Lexaria is considering an animal study to investigate the ability of DehydraTECH-CBD to potentially affect treatment of rheumatoid disease. Rheumatic diseases are autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that cause the immune system to attack joints, bones, muscles and organs. There are over 100 rheumatic diseases including Fibromyalgia, Lupus, Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The Rheumatoid Arthritis therapeutics market alone is expected to be over $30 billion per year by 2025. Lexaria has yet to commence study RHEUM-A22-1 as we are in the process of evaluating potential third-party service providers and suitable animal models to do so.
 Nicotine: NIC-A21-1. 

The results of our investigative work on the pharmacokinetic performance of DehydraTECH 2.0 nicotine formulations, specifically via the oral buccal/sublingual route of administration, were released in October 2021. We reported our Study NIC-A21-1 conducted in male beagle dogs, which demonstrated that DehydraTECH nicotine administered via the oral pouch product format required only 2 to 4 minutes to deliver nicotine levels in blood plasma comparable to levels achieved at 45 minutes with concentration-matched controls. DehydraTECH-nicotine also reached statistically significant peak blood plasma levels up to 10-fold higher overall than controls (p=0.004) while still clearing from blood virtually as quickly as the controls. Two nicotine formats were investigated in this study: nicotine benzoate and nicotine polacrilex. We found that the generic nicotine benzoate pouch required approximately 45 minutes to reach its peak delivery rate whereas the DehydraTECH nicotine benzoate pouch reached peak delivery rates at both 8 minutes and again at 30 minutes. It was found that 4 minutes after the pouch was placed in the mouth, the DehydraTECH-nicotine had reached a higher delivery level than the generic achieved at any point during the study. Similarly, the generic nicotine polacrilex pouch also required approximately 45 minutes to reach its very subdued peak delivery rate while the DehydraTECH nicotine polacrilex pouch achieved a comparable level in just 2 minutes. The DehydraTECH nicotine polacrilex pouch delivered over 10 times the nicotine level in blood plasma at peak than the generic version while still clearing from blood virtually as quickly as the controls.

Nicotine: NIC-H22-1

In November of 2022 we received independent review board approval for human clinical nicotine study NIC-H22-1, a 36-person human PK randomized, double blinded, cross-over study conducted in current cigarette smokers, wherein each person will visit the laboratory to be dosed three times over a period of weeks. During each visit only one oral nicotine pouch will be administered and evaluated: either DehydraTECH-nicotine; On!™ brand manufactured by Altria; or Zyn™ brand manufactured by Swedish Match™. Predetermined questionnaires for subjective evaluation will be used for each oral nicotine pouch, and blood samples will be taken 8 times per visit to conduct objective evaluations related to quantity of nicotine in blood at various time points. Data on vital signs such as temperature, blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate will also be collected. Subjective evaluations related to throat burn, user experience, gastrointestinal experience will also be conducted. Lexaria hopes to evidence that processing purified nicotine with DehydraTECH leads to better oral-tissue absorption and reduced negative experiences compared to currently marketed brands. The study had earlier faced certain time extensions due to manufacturing and logistics, those issues since resolved. The study is fully funded from internal company resources. Lexaria will provide further updates and any relevant material findings in due course. 
Business Development

Hypertension

Approximately 1.28 billion people worldwide suffer from hypertension - elevated blood pressure - and is recognized as one of the world’s top health problems. Only 21% of people with hypertension have it under control which demonstrates enormous unmet need. Among persons 50 years of age or older, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, and systolic blood pressure becomes more important than diastolic blood pressure as an independent risk predictor for coronary events, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. 

Drugs focused on blood pressure and related conditions are some of the best selling drugs in the world. Lipitor™, used to treat high cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, has generated $94.7 billion in revenue from 1992 until 2017. Plavix™ is used to prevent heart attack and stroke, has sold $46.5 billion from 1992 until 2017. There are several hypertension drugs that each generate $1 billion per year or more in revenue. Hypertension valued at $28 billion per year is one subset of the broader cardiovascular disease category, which is expected to be a $146 billion market in 2022.

Lexaria is determined to fill the need for a safe, effective, tolerable treatment for hypertension and have a meaningful impact on comorbidity-related costs and deaths with our DehydraTECH-CBD. In pre-clinical and exploratory studies conducted to-date, Lexaria has evaluated through in vivo, in vitro, and human clinical testing the repeatedly evidenced efficacy in utilizing DehydraTECH-CBD to reduce blood pressure while avoiding serious negative adverse effects. Efficacy and lack of negative side effects are two major objectives of FDA-registered clinical studies. With the continued favorable results from our 2021-2022 HYPER programs, we have begun the Investigational New Drug “(IND”) application process. Lexaria has retained the services of a regulatory affairs and quality assurance consultancy group that assisted us with the preparation of our pre-IND meeting with the FDA. They are now assisting us with our protocol finalization and IND filing.

On June 6, 2022, we successfully filed a pre-IND meeting request with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA has responded to and confirmed Lexaria’s filing and requested a pre-IND meeting, which formally initiates communications with the FDA regarding development of Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-CBD for the treatment of hypertension. The purpose of the pre-IND meeting is to confirm the details and acceptability of Lexaria’s ongoing IND-enabling development program to be completed thereafter prior to proceeding with its full IND application filing.

On August 10, 2022, the FDA sent a positive written response from its pre-IND meeting regarding DehydraTECH-CBD for the treatment of hypertension. The FDA confirmed that it has agreed with Lexaria’s proposal to pursue a 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) regulatory pathway for our program. This is advantageous because this abbreviated pathway, as it is often described, typically enables a quicker route to commercial approval than a traditional 505(b)(1) NDA pathway. Within this communication the FDA agreed that additional non-clinical studies are not required prior to initiation of the DehydraTECH-CBD IND program, given the compelling data presented by Lexaria and others regarding the safety and tolerability of CBD. This supports Lexaria’s belief that our recent human clinical study program would support our pursuit of eventual FDA registrations.


11


Lexaria’s new IND-enabling program is made possible through successfully completed studies that have provided support for more ambitious commercial goals. Recently achieved successful results from two human clinical pharmacodynamic hypertension studies and a 2018 human clinical pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study, along with a number of successful animal studies demonstrating PK performance and the molecular characterization work completed through Canada’s National Research Council, have together established a strong body of evidence for Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-CBD. These studies have shown that DehydraTECH-CBD demonstrates superior bio absorption upon oral administration and is effective at reducing blood pressure with no significant unwanted side effects.

Subject to budgetary constraints, Lexaria plans to continue with in vitro and in vivo studies testing the absorption of many API’s – CBD, vitamins, PDE5 inhibitors, antiviral drugs, nicotine, and others – to substantiate the effectiveness of DehydraTECH. More than simply satisfying scientific curiosity, successful tests are expected to lead to increased awareness and acceptance of our technology as a meaningful effective alternative to current delivery methods. Therefore, absorption tests could increasingly become an important element leading towards higher rates of acceptance of our technology licensing initiatives.

Nicotine

More than 99% of all nicotine consumed worldwide is delivered through smoking cigarettes. Worldwide, approximately 6m deaths per year are attributed primarily to the delivery of nicotine through the act of smoking. This is according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also estimates that over $170b per year is spent just in the U.S. on direct medical care costs for adult smokers. Lexaria hopes to see the reduction of common but less healthy nicotine administration methods by way of enabling development of safe and effective oral nicotine dosage formats. 

The oral nicotine pouch category is one of the fastest growing segments of the nicotine industry due in part to its reduced risk health outcomes as noted by the FDA. This delivery method, in the white pouch format specifically, involves absorption primarily through the buccal tissues of the mouth, of purified nicotine that has been separated from most other harmful compounds in the tobacco leaf. which avoids harmful lung outcomes experienced by smokers or vapers, The global market for the oral nicotine pouch category was US$2.33 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $21.84 billion in 2027. 

DehydraTECH-Nicotine Research

Lexaria has previously completed ingestible nicotine in vivo (animal) absorption study work. In a 2018 we conducted a study designed to assess the relative ingestible nicotine absorption performance of DehydraTECH-powered formulations when compared to concentration-matched control formulations in rats. DehydraTECH formulations delivered some major nicotine absorption performance improvements: 1,160% faster delivery of equivalent peak quantities of nicotine to the bloodstream than achieved with controls (within 15 min vs. 2.9 hours), 148% gain in the quantity of peak nicotine delivery to the bloodstream relative to controls, 560% higher brain levels of nicotine where nicotine effects are focused, compared to controls, lower urine levels of nicotine excreted than controls, for enhanced nicotine activity and bioavailability over the course of the study, lower quantities of key liver metabolites in the bloodstream than controls as hypothesized, suggesting bypass of first pass liver metabolism.

The DehydraTECH formulations generally achieved faster absorption, higher peak absorption, and higher overall quantities of nicotine, on average, in the blood than the concentration-matched control formulations at both the 1mg and 10 mg/Kg doses tested. Furthermore, there were no obvious signs of gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting or diarrhea indicating that the animals appeared to tolerate the treatment well.

Nicotine blood levels were evaluated multiple times over a period of 8 hours after dosing. In the 10mg/Kg dosing arm, the control formulation required nearly 3 hours to reach similar levels of blood absorption that the DehydraTECH formulation reached in only 15 minutes. Furthermore, the DehydraTECH formulation went on thereafter to demonstrate peak plasma levels that were 148% of those achieved by the control formulation. If replicated in human studies, these findings are suggestive that DehydraTECH could prove more effective in elevating blood nicotine levels through edible formats much more quickly and substantially than previously theorized, potentially making ingestible nicotine preparations a viable alternative to today’s available product formats while also leading to a more rapid nicotine craving satiation.

Analysis of the liver metabolites revealed that overall levels in the blood of two of the three metabolites studied were higher in the control group than in the DehydraTECH formulation group at the 10 mg/Kg dose. The study also revealed that the DehydraTECH formulation at the 10 mg/Kg level achieved up to 5.6-times as much nicotine upon analysis of the rat brain tissue than was recovered with the matching control formulation. These findings together perhaps suggest prolongation of nicotine effectiveness with the DehydraTECH formulation which may also be beneficial in humans to control cravings over an extended time-period from a single edible nicotine dose.

Following the above study, additional results were reported in August 2018 by way of a follow-up third-party in vivo study including two groups of 20 animals. This study further demonstrated delivery of nicotine in edible form at each of the 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-minute intervals post-dosing, with 90.2% greater delivery than the concentration-matched control formulation by the 10-minute mark (95% CI; p=0.044), and significantly greater absorption levels than the control formulation at all subsequent time points in the study. Speed of onset is a key attribute for oral drug administration, and it is of particular importance for the consideration of non-inhalation nicotine delivery formats. Some of the highlights of this study were: 79% improvement in peak blood levels; 94% improvement in total quantity of nicotine delivered to the blood during the 60-minute course of the study and; Lexaria’s technology delivered nicotine into the blood stream by the first time interval of blood sampling at the 2-minute mark.

Nicotine Patent

With the grant during the year ended August 31, 2022, of our Australian patent for nicotine, Lexaria believes that further potential patent awards would serve to support significant competitive advantages in the nicotine white pouch category, as well as other oral nicotine product formats such as pills, tablets, lozenges, capsules, gums and sprays. A similar patent filing has been made in the USA. As Lexaria demonstrates the benefits of DehydraTECH enabled oral nicotine pouches as an alternative to smoking cigarettes as a delivery method for nicotine, we anticipate the possibilities of engaging in licensing arrangements with major tobacco companies. Given the rapid progress Lexaria is making towards development of oral nicotine products, the intellectual property protection afforded by this patent and other similar patent applications, could be meaningful towards building stakeholder value. 
Nicotine Collaborations

In April of 2022 the Company announced new agreements with Altria Client Services, LLC (“Altria”) in effect until March 31, 2023. Under the terms of these agreements, Lexaria will receive a fee to provide certain DehydraTECH powder-based nicotine formulations to be evaluated by Altria. In 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Altria to fund the R&D of DehydraTECH technology as it relates to nicotine. In exchange for a minority equity interest (16.67%) in our subsidiary Lexaria Nicotine LLC, Altria was to fund up to $12m for Lexaria Nicotine to conduct milestone-based clinical investigations utilizing DehydraTECH. Altria did not exercise its First Warrant Tranche to invest a further staged payment into Lexaria Nicotine and that warrant therefore expired on October 8, 2020 along with Altria’s former exclusive access to DehydraTECH for nicotine in the US market.
Licencing 

The Company began out-licensing our technology in the US in 2018 for the use of DehydraTECH for vitamins and food and beverages infused with cannabinoids in concentrations greater than 0.3% THC. In 2019 we granted US licences for DehydraTECH enabled CBD products and also entered into a definitive agreement in the US for licencing DehydraTECH. In December of 2020, Lexaria sold our non-pharmaceutical THC-related assets held within our wholly owned subsidiary Lexaria CanPharm ULC to Hill Street Beverage Company Ltd. As a part of the sale agreement, the Company transferred our THC licence contracts for manufacturers that sell, or intend to sell, THC infused products in the US and Canada.

In January of 2021 the global rights to DehydraTECH technology to make non-pharmaceutical products that contain over 0.3% THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids was sold to Hill Street Beverages Company Inc. Lexaria has retained the rights to use DehydraTECH with THC and other cannabinoids for pharmaceutical purposes. Lexaria’s investigation of enhanced delivery characteristics of THC utilizing DehydraTECH technology is now focused on medical applications. Our study findings have demonstrated rapid delivery, increased overall THC delivery, and higher brain tissue delivery; all of which is consistent with the wants and needs of medicinal THC customers.

During the last fiscal quarter of 2022, Premier Wellness Science Co. Ltd., (“Premier”) of Japan agreed to purchase the rights to DehydraTECH technology for the Japanese non-pharmaceutical market for use with CBD and hemp ingredients in oral liquid and non-liquid products, as well as for topical, hair-care, lip-care and cosmetics products. Exclusive rights are subject to two previously issued licenses for use of DehydraTECH in Japan, which remain valid. Lexaria will not be issuing any further licenses in Japan for non-pharmaceutical cannabinoid products.

In order to retain ongoing exclusivity, the negotiated minimum quarterly payments to Lexaria begin September 1, 2022 and during the first five years of the agreement amount to a minimum of $4.5m. The license for the Japanese market is perpetual assuming that Premier submits all required payments.

In addition to the minimum payments, Lexaria will also receive royalty revenue from DehydraTECH licensed product sales under the agreed terms. Total revenue is anticipated to be significantly greater than the minimum payments if Premier is capable of meeting its forecasted revenue targets. If Premier achieves even their worst-case projected penetration into the Japanese non-pharmaceutical CBD market, then based on their projections Lexaria could expect to receive annual payments of over $5 million by the fifth year of the contract.

Following rigorous product development and formula optimization Premier is expected to introduce the “Ko” brand containing Lexaria’s DehydraTECH delivery technology in 2023. The product line focuses on the endocannabinoid system and circadian rhythm to support the health and wellness. It will contain CBD and other botanical extracts. Premier will create its own e-commerce infrastructure and digital marketing campaigns in collaboration with its parent company, Premier Anti-Aging Co., Ltd. Originally founded in 2009, Premier Anti-Aging Co. it is a large distributor and logistics supplier for cosmetics, OTC pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals to wholesalers and retailers. It has shipped more than 3.5 billion products in its most recent fiscal year comprised of over 50,000 products distributed to over 50,000 retail stores.

Lexaria, on June 8, 2022, awarded AnodGen Bioceutical of Ireland a five-year, non-exclusive DehydraTECH license from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lexaria Pharmaceutical Corp. The license is valid within Europe including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, for pharmaceutical and medical product applications incorporating DehydraTECH-infused psychoactive cannabinoid powders and medical product applications incorporating DehydraTECH-infused non-psychoactive cannabinoid powders. AnodGen will pay royalty fees to Lexaria for all cannabinoid powders sold that utilize the DehydraTECH technology. AnodGen has the right to manufacture and sell these DehydraTECH-infused powders to third party companies for their own products that are designated by a national regulator as a medical product, drug, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical, as applicable, under its cannabinoid product license rights. Consumer products purchased without physician or medical professional consultation are not permitted under the terms of this License. AnodGen is expected to have their new facility in Ireland fully operational in 2023

On June 21, 2022, the Company entered into two agreements with BevNology LLC. The first agreement is a manufacturing operating agreement that expands production capabilities for Lexaria’s own growing list of business-to-business (“B2B”) clientele interested in purchasing DehydraTECH-powered active ingredients for consumer packaged-goods. A new processing facility custom-built by BevNology increases and broadens their production capacity and is now serving Lexaria’s B2B clients. Lexaria has installed specialized DehydraTECH manufacturing equipment into the new facility as it prepares for future growth in its B2B ingredient processing business.

The second agreement is a commercial license agreement that empowers BevNology to offer DehydraTECH products with active ingredients derived from hemp, including CBD under BevNology and partnered brands. For powdered DehydraTECH formulations this agreement is non-exclusive. For liquid DehydraTECH formulations, where BevNology has specialized skills and capabilities, the license is non-exclusive in most areas of the world but includes limited exclusivity rights in the United States only that require certain minimum fee payments in order to maintain those rights. Lexaria will receive royalties from BevNology as a result of their utilization of this license. The only countries specifically excluded under this license are Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the People’s Republic of China.

On September 16, 2021, Lexaria Hemp entered into a 10-year license with GlobalCanna Inc. for the non-exclusive use of DehydraTECH in multiple CBD infused products in Canada. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, GlobalCanna is required to pay minimum quarterly fees beginning in the quarter ended November 30, 2022.

Competition

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of any DehydraTECH enhanced product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, convenience of use, price, and reimbursement. We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of API delivery platforms. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new more advanced API delivery technologies become available. There can be no assurance that our competitors are not currently developing, or will not in the future develop, technology that is equally or more effective or is more economically attractive than any of our current or any enhanced versions of DehydraTECH. 

Our competitors may be able to develop other drug delivery platforms that are able to achieve similar or better results than DehydraTECH. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel therapeutics or to in-license novel therapeutics that could make DehydraTECH-enabled product candidates obsolete. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly as they develop novel approaches to oral or topical drug delivery that DehydraTECH is focused on. 

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries result in even greater concentration of resources and capital in our competitors. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing API delivery technologies that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than DehydraTECH.

Competition in alternative health sectors and consumer products in the U.S. is fierce. We expect to encounter competitive threats from existing and new participants in the sector with competing technologies. Food supplements, organic foods, and health food markets are all well established and the Company and/or its licensees will face many challenges within these markets. Although PoViva Corp. has filed patent applications to protect intellectual property, there is no assurance that patents beyond those already issued will be granted nor that other firms may not file superior patents pending. Lexaria is aware of other competing technologies that claim to also enhance the bio absorption of bioactive molecules as DehydraTECH has repeatedly demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo scientific testing. By and large, these technologies are mostly forms of nanotechnology that generally claim to enable the formation of microencapsulated microemulsions of active ingredients. These technologies can enable exceptional water solubility of ingredients and can impart improved intestinal bio absorption as a result, but do not necessarily offer the breadth of performance and value enhancing benefits that Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology offers to its licensees. 

Competition in nicotine, alternative nicotine delivery and nicotine cessation sectors in the U.S. is comprised of long-established entities, brands, and new technologies competing to create less harmful options. The sectors are complicated by the significant historical empirical data of older products or technologies versus the more limited published supporting data regarding the effects of new products or technologies. Due to the size of the sectors we expect to encounter competitive threats from existing participants and unknown new entrants. There is no assurance that other technologies already deployed, or in development, will not form the basis of product formats that competitors or consumers choose to utilize. It is also possible that historic delivery methods that have been in use and the familiarity with them may prevent adoption of products utilizing DehydraTECH in alternative delivery formats. Competing technologies or products may utilize known delivery formats or entirely new and unforecastable formats. Lexaria has demonstrated through scientific testing that DehydraTECH delivers nicotine rapidly and effectively through oral delivery. We believe that if we can educate and influence consumers to adopt a food-grade edible product format, and if US regulatory bodies authorize such format, we may be able to offer a competitively successful new product format that utilizes DehydraTECH. 

While we are an early adopter providing technology to the cannabinoid sector, there are a large number of public companies that have claimed to be involved in the sector in some fashion, and an unknown number of private companies. Our current strategies may prove to be ineffective as the sector grows and matures, and if so, we will have to adapt quickly to changing sectoral circumstances. Accordingly, the Company intends to aggressively pursue technology out-licensing opportunities not only within the cannabinoids and nicotine sector where we are already active, but also across other sectors where DehydraTECH is patent allowed and/or pending, including opportunities in the vitamin and supplements sector and the pain relief sector. 

Lexaria believes DehydraTECH offers a host of benefits beyond what competing technologies can offer, including superior oral palatability, a more appealing and all-natural ingredient compositional profile from an oral product and beverage formulation perspective, more predictable time of delivery into bloodstream and certain target tissues, and superior scalability and cost effectiveness from a manufacturing perspective. Lexaria believes that DehydraTECH is significantly distinguished from competing technologies in these respects and has a view of growing the breadth and number of licensees who will adopt DehydraTECH into their product offerings. Lexaria believes that these competitive advantages together with our wealth of scientific data showing noteworthy bio absorption enhancements with DehydraTECH constitute a compelling value proposition for its prospective licensees. We intend to continue to pursue license arrangements in the multiple bioactive ingredient sectors identified in its issued and pending patent applications.

Compliance with Government Regulation 

More than thirty-nine states in the U.S. have passed some form of legislation related to that state’s permission to grow, cultivate, sell, or use marijuana and/or CBD for medical purposes or for recreational use. Legislation is not necessarily harmonious between states and in most circumstances, it is not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines.

Lexaria legally conducts R&D on cannabis ingredients in our Canadian federally licensed laboratory in compliance with all federal and local Canadian laws. We abide by U.S. federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural hemp and certain by-products to be manufactured and sold in the U.S. DehydraTECH is only licensed to those companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale and distribution of cannabis related products in their licensed operating territories. 

DehydraTECH has applications in completely separate sectors such as vitamins, CBD for applications under pursuit for medical applications registered with the FDA, and nicotine. We are continuing formulation development for research and validation purposes in each of these areas. We have a formal relationship with the Altria Group and have conducted R&D with that company related to the possible development of nicotine oral products. If we do enter any of these sectors, we may be exposed to and of necessity may have to comply with all local, state, and federal regulations in each of those sectors. As a result of the possibility of Lexaria being involved in a number of disparate business sectors, compliance with government regulations could require significant resources and expertise from our Company.

The U.S. Farm Bill, passed in December 2018, and the ambiguity regarding the incorporation of CBD into ingested and topical products has had significant impacts on the industry segments that we operate in. This could potentially change some of the regulatory compliance risks that may affect our business. The bill includes lifting restrictions on advertising, marketing, banking, and other financial services as well as allowing interstate commerce for hemp and hemp-derived CBD. It is also facilitating the removal of barriers for intellectual property protections under federal law such as patents and trademarks, as well as several other measures that may positively impact these industry segments overall. The effects the Bill may have on other regulatory bodies and their regulations will require ongoing monitoring to determine the timing and outcome of any revisions.
