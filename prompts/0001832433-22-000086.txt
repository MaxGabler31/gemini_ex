Item 1.Business
Overview
Ferguson’s operations are based, through its subsidiaries, in North America, where Ferguson is a value-added distributor providing expertise, solutions and products from infrastructure, plumbing and appliances to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”), fire, fabrication and more. We exist to make our customers’ complex projects simple, successful and sustainable. We sell through a common network of distribution centers, branches and specialist sales associates, counter service, showroom consultants and e-commerce. 
The Company has a long history and expanded its businesses in the 1980s through organic growth and acquisitions in the United States, Canada and Europe, including the acquisition in 1982 of Ferguson Enterprises, LLC (“Ferguson Enterprises”), the Company’s U.S. subsidiary. As the business in the United States continued to grow and Ferguson Enterprises became the Company’s largest subsidiary, the Company’s focus shifted to North American markets. As a result, the operating businesses across Europe were sold and/or disposed of through various historical transactions, with the most recent disposal being the sale of Ferguson’s shares in Wolseley UK Limited (the “U.K. business”) on January 29, 2021.
The Company was incorporated and registered in Jersey on March 8, 2019 under the Jersey Companies Law, as a private limited company under the name Alpha JCo Limited with company number 128484. The Company converted its status to a public limited company and changed its name to Ferguson Newco plc on March 26, 2019. The Company then changed its name to Ferguson plc on May 10, 2019. Although our jurisdiction of organization is Jersey, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom and therefore we are a tax resident of the United Kingdom. The Company’s registered office address is 13 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey JE1 1ES, Channel Islands, and the Company’s corporate headquarters address is 1020 Eskdale Road, Winnersh Triangle, Wokingham, Berkshire RG41 5TS and its telephone number is +44 (0) 118 927 3800. The Company is also registered in the United Kingdom as Ferguson Group Holdings, U.K. Establishment No. BR021199. Our management office in the United States is located at 12500 Jefferson Ave, Newport News, VA 23602.
Ferguson is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: FERG) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE: FERG). 
Business segments
The Company’s reportable segments are established based on how the Company manages its business and allocates resources, which is on a geographical basis. The Company’s reportable segments are the United States and Canada. For further segment information, see Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). Below is a description of the Company’s reportable segments.
United States segment
The United States segment contributed 95%, 94% and 95% of net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
The United States segment operates primarily under the Ferguson brand and provides expertise, solutions, and products, from infrastructure, plumbing and appliances to HVAC, fire, fabrication and more, to residential and non-residential contractors. Its products are delivered through a common network of distribution centers, branches and specialist sales associates, counter service, showroom consultants and e-commerce. As of July 31, 2022, the United States business operated 1,509 branches and 10 national distribution centers serving all 50 states with approximately 33,000 associates. These locations provide same-day and next-day product availability, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and an important requirement for customers. In addition, our United States business operates two market distribution centers (“MDCs”) in Denver, Colorado and Phoenix, Arizona for branch replenishment and final mile distribution to customers.
Canada segment
The Canada segment contributed 5%, 6% and 5% of net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Canada segment operates primarily under the Wolseley brand and supplies plumbing, HVAC and refrigeration products to residential and commercial contractors. The Canada segment also supplies specialist water and wastewater treatment products to residential, commercial and infrastructure contractors, and supplies pipe, valves and fittings (“PVF”) solutions to industrial customers. As of July 31, 2022, the Canada business operated 211 branches with one national distribution center and approximately 3,000 associates. 
Business model
We have a balanced approach to attractive end markets and serve customers principally in North America with approximately 54% of our net sales to residential markets and 46% to non-residential markets. Our net sales within the residential and non-residential markets are also balanced between RMI (approximately 60% of our net sales) and new construction (approximately 40% of our net sales). 
Our business bridges the gap between a large and fragmented supplier base with an even larger and more fragmented customer base. As of July 31, 2022, we had more than 37,000 suppliers, with no supplier accounting for more than 5% of total cost of sales, which provides us access to a diverse and broad range of quality products. We serve our customers through a network of 11 national distribution centers, two MDCs, 5,600 fleet vehicles, 1,720 branches and approximately 36,000 associates, in each case, as of July 31, 2022. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of net sales in fiscal 2022.
Customers
Our purpose is to act as a trusted supplier and partner to our customers, providing innovative products and solutions to help make their complex projects simple, successful and sustainable. We offer expertise and a broad range of products delivered where and when our customers need them. Customers rely on us to help them deliver critical infrastructure spanning almost every stage of projects within the residential and non-residential markets. Whatever the future challenges, we will continue to partner with our customers to keep millions of homes and businesses operating while helping them to run their business more efficiently. 
Ferguson operates in highly fragmented markets, with no one market dominated by any single distributor. We are positioned as one of the top distributors in most markets we serve, including residential, commercial, civil/infrastructure and industrial.
Value-added products and solutions 
Our purpose is to act as a trusted supplier and partner to our customers, providing innovative products and solutions to make their projects better. With our value-added solutions, we aim to increase productivity for our customers and for the industry. Our value-added solutions include a variety of sales channels available to our customers ranging from inside and outside sales teams, sales centers, digital commerce capabilities, system-to-system capabilities, counter sales and showrooms. We also offer customized solutions such as virtual design, fabrication, valve actuation, pre-assembly, kitting, installation and project management services. 
We source, distribute and sell products from domestic and international suppliers. Our products include branded products and own brand products that the Company sells exclusively in the market. We purchase from more than 37,000 suppliers. Over 95% of the products sold in the United States are sourced from U.S.-based suppliers. Over 92% of the products sold in Canada are sourced from Canada-based suppliers.
Our branded and own brand products are generally available from several sources and are not generally subject to supply constraints in normal market conditions. In the United States, approximately 16% of net sales are derived from basic products containing significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, predominantly plastic, copper and steel, and other components which can be subject to volatile price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. To a lesser extent, fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs. In general, increases in such prices increase our operating costs and negatively impact our operating profit to the extent that such increases cannot be passed on to customers. Conversely, if competitive pressures allow us to hold prices despite relevant raw material prices falling, profitability can increase. 
Fulfillment options for our customers include same day delivery, locker pick-up, pro pick-up, multiple delivery locations, project staging and direct shipment. 
We also offer after-sales support that comprises warranty, credit, project-based billing, returns and maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) support.
Global supply chain
We have a global supply chain which provides access to more than 37,000 suppliers and we sell more than 1 million unique products each year. We operate an extensive network across North America, including two import centers, 11 national distribution centers and more than 1,700 branch locations. Our network also includes two MDCs which we are continuing to expand into key strategic markets and allows us to bring our products closer to our customers. These MDCs include automated picking and replenishment systems for the majority of orders being processed. This automation reduces manual handling of certain products which supports associate health and safety. 
Competitive conditions 
We believe we are well-equipped to win new customers and make attractive returns. We have leading positions in the residential and non-residential markets based on net sales as a percentage of overall market size. For fiscal 2022, 54% and 46% of our net sales were derived from residential and non-residential end markets, respectively, and 60% and 40% of our net sales were derived from the RMI and new construction sectors, respectively. We have chosen to operate in each of these markets because we believe we can generate strong growth, solid gross and net margins and good returns on capital.
The markets we serve are highly fragmented with very few large competitors and a high number of small, local distributors, as well as mid-size regional distributors. While our market positions can be expanded through growth of our existing business, acquisitions also remain a core part of our growth strategy and we expect to focus on acquisitions that bolt-on to our existing branch network as well as acquisitions that provide further capabilities to serve our customers. We believe there is a significant opportunity for strong growth and continued consolidation within each of these large, fragmented markets. 
Many customer projects require a range of products and services and we leverage our scale and expertise across the organization for the benefit of our customers. Specifically, we believe our network of suppliers, associates and the number of branches and distribution centers provides us with the scale and expertise to serve our customers better than our competitors do, as many of these competitors operate only locally. In addition, we also benefit from significant synergies to help lower operating costs and improve margins. We believe these factors enable continued growth in net sales as well as growth in cash flow and, therefore, may better enable us to provide investment returns to shareholders. 
Our scale and expertise position us to be involved in all stages of our customers' projects, including design, staging, and project management. Across all our customers, we take a consultative approach. We partner with our customers in an effort to guide complex projects to a successful conclusion, and to make the entire project better because Ferguson was involved.
Contractual relationships and seasonality
We are not dependent on any material licenses, industrial, commercial or financial contracts (including contracts with customers and suppliers) or new manufacturing processes. Our business is not highly seasonal. 
Intellectual property 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary assets and our brands. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally. 
Regulatory landscape 
The Company’s operations are affected by various statutes, regulations and standards in the countries and markets in which it operates, including the United States and Canada. The amount of such regulation and the penalties for any breaches can vary. While the Company is not engaged in a highly regulated industry, it is subject to the laws governing businesses generally, including laws relating to competition, product safety, data protection, labor and employment practices, accounting and tax standards, international trade, fraud, bribery and corruption, land usage, the environment, health and safety, transportation, payment terms and other matters. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position as compared to prior periods. 
Human capital management
Our associates are fundamental to the long-term success of the Company. We continue to invest in the development of our people and are committed to attracting, developing, engaging and retaining the best talent. 
Our people
As of July 31, 2022, Ferguson employed approximately 36,000 associates, of which approximately 33,000 were in the United States, 3,000 were in Canada and a small number of associates were in certain other jurisdictions, including the U.K. and Asia.
Human resources pillars and inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) 
Our human capital management program is grounded in our human resources pillars: attract, develop, engage, and retain. Our strategic focus on I&D is also tied to each of these pillars. We are committed to attracting and recruiting a diverse workforce and strive to identify and remove any potential for unconscious bias in hiring, promotion and succession decisions. Our diverse and inclusive hiring process assists us in fostering a culture of innovation and acceptance through differences in thought, experience and perspective. We believe that the range of perspectives fostered by a diverse and inclusive organization gives us a competitive advantage, especially when it is shaped by a workforce that reflects the diversity of our customers.
Talent development 
We place great emphasis on our associates’ development and provide opportunities to help them reach their full potential. Evidence of these opportunities can be seen in the career paths of our tenured leadership team. Through internal mobility, many of our leaders shifted from frontline roles to managerial roles. We offer a variety of training, leadership and development programs that develop skills and capabilities for our associates and leaders, and are tailored to associates’ leadership level and potential. The Company also offers associates professional development courses, many of which are on-demand, which are targeted at improving technical skills, sales, well-being, critical thinking and relationship management skills. A mix of internal opportunities and external hires, blended with new talent through acquisitions, allows us to broaden the experience, knowledge and diversity of our leadership teams and overall workforce. 
Associate engagement and retention
We champion engagement initiatives to further a culture where associates feel welcomed and valued. Our Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) provide associates with opportunities to find affiliation, share common experiences and strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging. We currently maintain four BRGs supporting our Black, women, LGBTQ+ and veteran associates. Membership in our BRGs is open to all our associates. Each BRG has an executive sponsor, chair and leadership team who are voted into their roles by applicable BRG members. 
We are committed to supporting our associates as well as customers and people within our communities. Through a variety of outreach efforts and our Associates in Action program, we provide our associates with the opportunity to directly engage in community service and contribute to Ferguson being a good corporate citizen.
We offer these development and engagement programs to aid in the growth, engagement and retention of our associates. We believe that these programs, as well as our strategic focus on I&D, support our objective to retain the best talent.
Culture and values
We strive to maintain a culture of integrity and are committed to acting ethically in all our business activities. Our core values provide guidance on ethical situations where there may be uncertainty over how to proceed and set out the standards that we expect of our associates and those who may work on our behalf. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) is a resource dedicated to helping our associates live by our values and understand Ferguson’s commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, our Code of Conduct and Company policies. We require all associates, including new associates, to complete our Code of Conduct training on an annual basis. 
Compensation and rewards
To help attract and retain the best talent available in the market, we offer our associates competitive rewards packages. The structure of our incentive programs is reviewed on a continual basis for alignment with our talent attraction and retention goals and our corporate purpose and values. We are committed to rewarding our associates based on the delivery of business objectives, as well as outstanding individual performance. We offer a wide variety of health, welfare, and financial benefits to our full-time and part-time associates, including health care and insurance benefits, retirement plans, an employee share purchase plan, paid time off and leave programs (including paid parental leave), among others.
We currently have several established recognition programs, where our top performing sales associates and managers receive recognition, and a leadership award to recognize Ferguson sales associates who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance and sales leadership. The purpose of these programs is to demonstrate our appreciation for our associates and to recognize the exceptional performance and outstanding contributions they make to help support profitable growth in our business. 
Health and safety
We maintain high standards for safety, expectations for safe behaviors and safety rules and enforcement processes in an effort to drive continuous improvement in our health and safety performance. We strive to maintain a culture of safety, which begins with safety training and with our leaders modeling the behaviors we want our associates to adopt. We endeavor to ensure that at each location, our associates are well-informed about health and safety measures and are provided with the appropriate equipment and tools to protect themselves and those around them. Through continuous investment in health and safety we strive to mitigate the risk of on-the-job injuries. We actively engage with our associates, promoting a strong safety culture by empowering them to make safe decisions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented measures designed to protect the health and safety of our associates and our customers.
