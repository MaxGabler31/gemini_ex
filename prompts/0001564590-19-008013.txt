Item 1. Business
Organizational Structure
 People’s Utah Bancorp (“PUB” or the “Company”) is a Utah registered bank holding company organized in 1998.  As a Utah registered bank holding company, PUB is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (“UDFI”).  The Company operates all business activities through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, People’s Intermountain Bank (“PIB” or the “Bank”), which was organized in 1913.  The Bank is a Utah State chartered bank subject to primary regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and by the UDFI.
 PIB is a community bank that provides highly personalized retail and commercial banking products and services to small and medium sized businesses and individuals.  Products and services are offered primarily through 26 retail branches located throughout Utah and southern Idaho. PIB has three banking divisions, Bank of American Fork, Lewiston State Bank, and People’s Town & Country Bank; and a mortgage division, People’s Intermountain Bank Mortgage.
 Market Area
 Most of the major business and economic activity in Utah is located in the counties where our Bank branches are located.  Over 75% of Utah’s population is concentrated along Interstate 15, specifically within Davis, Weber, Salt Lake and Utah Counties. The next largest population centers in the state are in Washington and Cache Counties. These six counties make up approximately 85% of Utah’s population.  Utah has grown considerably over the past several years and provides several other benefits to the Company:

• | Utah is ranked first in the Nation for economic outlook from ALEC-Laffer State Economic Competitiveness Index, 2018;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | According to the 2019 Economic Report to the Governor (Utah), Utah is ranked first in the Nation for economic diversity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utah ranked first in the Nation for personal income growth between July 2017, and June 2018, according to the Pew Charitable Trust in July 2018;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | According to a U.S. Census Bureau report in May 2018, Utah is the fastest growing State in terms of housing units;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | According to CNBC, Utah has ranked in the top 10 States for Business since 2007; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utah is one of the fastest growing states in the United States in terms of population, ranking third in percentage growth according to the U.S. Census Bureau for the period between July 1, 2017 and July 1, 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have successfully executed our growth initiatives to-date through organic growth and strategic merger and acquisition opportunities.  In 2017, we completed our acquisition of $257 million in loans and seven Utah branch locations with $160 million in low-cost core deposits from Banner Corporation’s subsidiary Banner Bank.  The seven branch locations in Utah include Salt Lake City, Provo, South Jordan, Woods Cross, Orem, Salem, and Springville.  The Woods Cross and Orem branches were consolidated into our existing Bank of American Fork Bountiful and Orem branches, respectively.  We operate these acquired branches under the name of Bank of American Fork, a division of PIB.  
 In 2017, we also completed the merger of Town & Country Bank located in St. George, Utah, including the acquisition of $117 million in loans and the assumption of $124 million in deposits.  We consolidated our existing St. George branch and Town & Country’s branch into one branch.  We operate this branch under the name of People’s Town & Country Bank, a division of PIB.

Competition
 The banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.
 
The competition for deposit and loan products is strong and directly affects the pricing of those products and the terms we offer to our customers. Price competition for deposits may adversely affect our ability to generate low-cost core deposits in our primary markets sufficient to fund our asset growth. As a result, we may seek alternative funding through borrowings and we may need to price our deposit products more aggressively, which would result in an increase in our costs of funding and a reduction in our net interest margin. Both our deposit base and overall market share have increased.  However, several larger banks have also grown their respective deposit market share in our markets. We believe aggressive marketing and advertising, branch expansion, expanded delivery channels, and more attractive rates offered by larger bank competitors have allowed larger banks to continue to increase their overall market share. Technological innovation has also contributed to greater competition in the overall financial services sector.
 The market share of PUB and our largest competitors in Utah as of June 30, 2018, ranked by deposit market share, as reported by S&P Global Market Intelligence is as follows:

Our Business Activities
 We believe that in order to be competitive with larger financial institutions it is imperative that we provide superior customer service.  Key elements to superior customer service include having seasoned relationship managers who understand our customers’ financial needs, provide direct access to decision makers, offer the products and services our customers want, give unparalleled responsiveness to our customers’ needs, and offer technology solutions that make it easier for our customers to transact with us. 
 We provide banking services to small to medium sized businesses and individuals in our primary markets including Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, Cache, and Washington Counties. Our business customers are involved in a variety of industries including residential and commercial construction and development, manufacturing, distribution and other services. We also provide a broad range of banking services and products to individuals, including residential mortgage lending, personal checking and savings accounts and other consumer banking products, including electronic banking.
 Lending
 We offer a variety of lending products including commercial real estate, construction and development, commercial and industrial (“C&I”), multifamily residential, single family residential, home equity lines, equipment finance, and other consumer loans.  We have established portfolio thresholds for each of our lending categories and regularly monitor and evaluate the diversification of our portfolio. From time to time, we purchase and sell non-consumer loan participations to or from other banks. Loan participations purchased by us have been underwritten using our standard and customary underwriting criteria.

Our customers are generally comprised of the following groups:
  
• | Real estate developers and contractors in need of land, construction and permanent financing for commercial and residential developments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small to medium sized businesses in need of secured and unsecured lines of credit through SBA financing or conventional C&I term loans and lines of credit, equipment financing, or owner occupied commercial real estate loans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Individuals in need of residential mortgage and consumer loan products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Professionals and professional firms, such as medical, architectural, engineering, and insurance and financial firms, in need of operating facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real Estate
 We are focused on commercial and residential real estate lending throughout a project’s life-cycle, including acquisition and development loans, construction loans, and permanent, long-term mortgage financing.
 Construction, Acquisition and Development Loans. Our construction loan portfolio consists of single-family residential properties, multifamily properties and commercial projects. Construction lending entails significant additional risks compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Construction loans also involve additional risks since funds are advanced while the property is under construction, and has uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and whether related loan-to-value ratios will be sufficient to compensate for fluctuations in the real estate market to minimize the risk of loss. Maturities for construction loans generally range from six to 12 months for residential property and from 12 to 18 months for commercial and multifamily properties.
 Our development loans are secured by the properties being platted and developed. Lending on raw land carries a significant risk of a change in market conditions during the development process. Our borrowers’ projects generally range from small plats of two to six lots to subdivisions with up to 40 lots. We occasionally consider development loans for larger projects. During the development process, we fund costs for site clearing, grading, and infrastructure, including utilities and roads. Lot release minimum prices are agreed upon at loan closing. Repayment of the development loan is generally structured to require net sale proceeds from lot sales or a minimum of 125% of the bank’s per-lot exposure. We target most development loans to be paid off at no more than 80% of total development sales. Loan-to-value ratios on development loans typically range from 55% to 70%, depending on the financial strength and experience of the developer. Most development loans have maturities of 12 to 24 months.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. We also originate mortgages for commercial real estate properties. These loans are primarily secured by commercial real estate, including office, retail, warehouse, industrial, and other non-residential properties. The majority of these loans have maturities generally ranging from three to 10 years.
 Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risk compared with the residential mortgage lending. Commercial mortgage loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent than is the case with residential mortgage loans, to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the general economy. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria requires an examination of debt service coverage ratios, the borrowers’ creditworthiness and prior credit history and reputation, and we generally require personal guarantees or endorsements with respect to these loans. In the loan underwriting process, we also carefully consider the location of the property serving as collateral, as well as the tenants occupying the property.
 5


Loan-to-value ratios for non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans generally do not exceed 75%. We permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% if the property is owner-occupied and the borrower has strong liquidity, net worth, and cash flow. We have been active in both the construction lending and permanent financing of our commercial real estate portfolio. Construction and raw land loans are short-term in nature and generally do not exceed 18 months. Permanent commitments are primarily restricted to no greater than 10 year maturities with rate adjustment periods every three to five years when fixed commitments exist.
 Residential Mortgage Loans. Our residential mortgage loans consist of residential first and second mortgage loans, residential construction loans and home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers. Second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are used for home improvements, education and other personal expenditures. We make mortgage loans with a variety of terms, including fixed, floating and variable interest rates and a variety of loan maturities. We sell substantially all of the first lien residential mortgage loans that we originate to larger financial institutions. We provide loan servicing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage loans.
 Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to repay the loan from the borrower’s salary and other income and are secured by residential real estate, the value of which is generally readily ascertainable. These loans are made consistent with our appraisal and real estate lending policies, which detail maximum loan-to-value ratios and maturities. Home equity lines of credit secured by owner-occupied property generally are made with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80%, including the first mortgage, if applicable.
 Commercial and Industrial:
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. We make C&I loans to qualified businesses in our market area. Our commercial lending portfolio consists primarily of C&I loans for the financing of accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment. We also offer loans guaranteed by the SBA.
 C&I loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets with less easily determinable or achievable value, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. Lines of credit typically have a 12 month commitment with a variable rate and are secured by the asset that is being financed. In cases of larger commitments, a borrowing base certificate is required to determine eligible collateral and advance parameters. Term loans seldom exceed 84 months, but in no case exceed the depreciable life of the tangible asset being financed. C&I loans generally include personal guarantees as additional support.
 To manage these risks, our policy is to secure commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and other collateral and guarantees that may be available. In addition, we actively monitor certain measures of the borrower, including advance rate, cash flow, leverage, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors.
 Consumer Loans
 Consumer Loans. Our consumer loans consist primarily of installment loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes. The specific types of consumer loans we make include home equity loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, debt consolidation loans and general consumer lending.
 Consumer loans may entail greater risk than real estate loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured, such as lines of credit, or secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. A loan may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loan, such as a bank, and a borrower may be able to assert against such assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral.
 6


Our policy for consumer loans is to accept moderate risk while minimizing losses, primarily through a careful credit and financial analysis of the borrower. In evaluating consumer loans, we require our lending officers to review the borrower’s level and stability of income, past credit history, amount of debt currently outstanding and the impact of these factors on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan in a timely manner. In addition, we require our banking officers to maintain an appropriate margin between the loan amount and collateral value.
 We also issue credit cards to certain customers. In determining to whom we will issue credit cards, we evaluate the borrower’s level and stability of income, past credit history and other factors. Finally, we make additional loans that are not classified in one of the above categories. In making such loans, we attempt to ensure that the borrower meets our loan underwriting standards.
 SBA Loans
 We have been an SBA Preferred Lender since 2002. As a Preferred Lender, we can approve a loan within the authority delegated to us by the SBA and are not required to go through the SBA directly on a per loan basis. 
 SBA loans fall into two categories (i) loans originated under the SBA’s 7(a) Program, or SBA 7(a) Loans, and (ii) loans originated under the SBA’s 504 Program or SBA 504 Loans. Through SBA 7(a) Loans, funds can be utilized to purchase or construct real property; however, we primarily use the 7(a) Program for working capital, inventory, or equipment loans, which are included in our C&I loans.  SBA 504 loans typically do not have an SBA guaranty, but rather, a low 50% loan to value ratio due to the assistance of the 504 program. SBA 504 loans are generally classified as commercial real estate, however, on occasion, a 504 loan will be used to finance long lived equipment.  Our SBA lending program, and portions of our real estate lending, are dependent on the continual funding and programs of certain federal agencies or quasi-government corporations, including the SBA.
 Loan Underwriting and Credit Policies
 Our Credit Department establishes our lending policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. These lending policies are reviewed at least annually and evaluated from time to time by senior lending management. Key elements of our current policies are debt service coverage, balance sheet analysis, monitoring concentration levels and maintaining strict approval and underwriting procedures.
 Debt Service Coverage. Our risk management philosophy is to extend credit only when an applicant has proven cash flow to service the proposed debt. Additionally, it is generally necessary for the applicant to demonstrate an independent secondary source of repayment.
 Balance Sheet Analysis.  Additional repayment support, such as liquidity, working capital, and sufficient equity is found on the balance sheet.  For this reason, the balance sheets of our borrowers are analyzed in the underwriting process.
 Monitor Concentration Levels. We have established maximum concentrations for each loan type and regularly monitor and evaluate the diversification of our loan portfolio. We have significant concentration in real estate loans. 
 Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the maximum concentration for loan types, state banking law generally limits the aggregate extensions of credit that a bank may make to a single borrower. Under Utah law, the aggregate extensions of credit that a bank may make to a single borrower generally may not exceed 15% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.  
 Approval and Underwriting Procedures. All loan requests must be approved under specified approval guidelines. Credit approval authority has four levels, as listed below from lowest to highest level. Management believes the current authority levels are appropriate to ensure overall credit quality, while ensuring we are able to respond in a timely manner to lending opportunities. Any conditions placed on loans in the approval process must be satisfied before our credit administration will release loan documentation for execution. Our credit administration works independently of loan production and has full responsibility for all loan disbursements.

Bank Lending Authorities:
  
• | Individual Authorities — Branch Managers typically have credit approval authority to loan up to $350,000 for secured loans provided there are no exceptions to loan policy. Within this authority, there are typically sub-limits for unsecured loans, equipment secured, accounts receivable and inventory secured loans, and other types of loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PIB Regional Loan Committee — The PIB Regional Loan Committee meets as needed, and consists of Senior Vice President — Regional Managers, and is chaired by a Senior Credit Administration Officer. The committee has credit approval authority to approve real estate secured loans up to $4.0 million, Accounts Receivable & Inventory secured loans up to $2.5 million, and unsecured loans up to $500,000. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PIB Loan Committee — The PIB Loan Committee generally meets twice a week; and consists of the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, a Senior Credit Administration Officer, and the President/Chief Operations Officer. This committee has unlimited credit approval authority for secured loans and unsecured loans, subject to ratification by the Board Loan Committee for real estate secured loan total aggregate debt relationships over $9.0 million and non-real estate secured loan total aggregate debt relationships over $6.5 million. If a credit decision requires immediate attention, a Senior Committee (consisting of a quorum of three members of either the PIB Regional or PIB Loan Committee, with a minimum of one being from the PIB Loan Committee) has the same approval authority as the PIB Loan Committee.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Board Loan Committee — The Board Loan Committee is comprised of six directors, with five committee members required for a quorum. All real estate secured loans and/or aggregate real estate loan secured relationships of $9.0 million and above or total aggregate non-real estate secured debt relationships exceeding $6.5 million require the approval of this committee. The committee meets weekly to approve loans approved by the PIB Loan Committee. This committee has approval authority up to our legal lending limit, which was approximately $47.7 million as of December 31, 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Loan Grading and Loan Review.  We seek to quantify the risk in our lending portfolio by maintaining a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories (Grades 1-9). The grading system is used to determine, in part, the provision for loan losses. The first five grades in the system are considered satisfactory. The other four grades range from a “Special Mention” category to a “Loss” category.
 The originating loan officer initially assigns a grade to each credit as part of the loan approval process. Such grade may be changed as a loan application moves through the approval process. In addition to any dollar limitations that may require higher credit approval authority, each loan that is graded “Substandard” or worse requires prior approval of the Bank’s senior lending officers.
 The grade on each individual loan is subject to review from time to time, and may be changed if warranted. The Bank’s senior lending officers monthly review a “Watch List” of loans that are over 60 days past due or graded 6 or higher. Additionally, changes in the grade for a loan may occur through any of the following means:
  
• | review of loans on the monthly Watch List;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | specific changes in loan grades by the loan officer, upon receiving new information that adversely impacts the borrower’s credit standing or other perceived credit risks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | random reviews of the loan portfolio conducted by senior lending officers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loan reviews conducted by an outside loan reviewer and the internal loan reviewer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bank regulatory examinations; and
--+----------------------------------


• | monthly action plans submitted to the Chief Credit Officer by the responsible lending officers for each credit on the Watch List.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8


Special Mention — Generally acceptable asset quality, but frequent and thorough monitoring is required as temporary credit weaknesses may extend beyond financial into managerial and demographic issues. Borrowers may have strained cash flow and less than anticipated performance. Borrowers may have possible management weaknesses, perhaps demonstrated by an irregular flow of adequate or timely performance information required to support the credit. Borrowers may have a plausible plan to correct problems in the near future without material uncertainties. Borrowers may lack reserve capacity, so their risk rating will generally either improve or decline in a relatively short time frame since results of corrective actions should be apparent within six months or less. These loans exhibit an increasing reliance on collateral for repayment.
 Loan Delinquencies.  When a borrower fails to make a committed payment, we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower to seek payment. Habitual delinquencies and loans delinquent 60 days or more are reviewed by the Chief Credit Officer regularly for possible changes in grading. Our Special Asset Committee meets quarterly to review classified assets. The Special Asset Committee is comprised of executive officers of the Bank.
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations require that each insured bank classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have authority to identify problem assets, and, if appropriate, reclassify them. 

• | Substandard — Unacceptable business credit; asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Though no loss is envisioned, the outlook is sufficiently uncertain to preclude ruling out the possibility; some liquidation of assets may be necessary as a corrective measure. Assets in this category may demonstrate performance problems such as cash flow deterioration trends including current or long-term debt service deficiencies with no immediate relief; borrower’s inability to adjust to prolonged and unfavorable industry or economic trends; management character and/or effectiveness have become suspect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Doubtful — Undesirable credit with loss potential. An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. At the point where a loss is identified, all or that portion deemed a loss is immediately classified as “Loss” and charged off.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loss — Total loss is expected. An uncollectible asset or one of such little value that it does not warrant classification as an active, earning asset. Such an asset may, however, have recovery or salvage value, but not to the point of deferring full write-off, even though some recovery may occur in the future. Our policy is to charge off such assets as a loss during the accounting period in which they were identified. These assets have been determined to have identifiable, uncollectible components. Typically, a partial charge-off of the loss will have occurred, and the balance remaining would be reflective of management’s best estimate of collectability.

Our Investment Activities
 Our investment strategy is designed to be complementary to and interactive with our cash position; borrowed funds; quality, maturity, stability and earnings of loans; nature and stability of deposits; capital and tax planning. Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Agency issues, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds. In addition, for liquidity purposes, we use Federal Funds Sold, which is temporary overnight sales of excess funds to correspondent banks. Our securities portfolio is managed in accordance with guidelines set by our investment policy. Specific day-to-day transactions affecting the securities portfolio are managed by the finance department of the Bank.

Our general objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to:
  
• | provide liquidity necessary to meet cyclical and long-term changes in the mix of assets and liabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achieve an acceptable asset/liability gap position based on our separate policy related to asset and liability management that provides guidance for how investments are to be used to manage asset and liability gaps;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain collateral for pledging requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | manage interest rate risk;
--+---------------------------


• | provide a suitable balance of quality and diversification to our assets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide a stable flow of dependable earnings.
--+----------------------------------------------

Deposit Products and Other Sources of Funds
 Our primary sources of funds for use in our lending and investing activities consist of:
  
• | deposits;
--+----------


• | maturities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other short-term borrowings.
--+-----------------------------

 We closely monitor rates and terms of competing sources of funds and utilize those sources we believe to be the most cost-effective, consistent with our asset and liability management policies.
 An important balance sheet component affecting our net interest margin is the composition and cost of our deposit base. We can improve our net interest margin to the extent that growth in deposits can be focused in the less volatile and somewhat more traditional core deposits, or total deposits less CDs greater than $250,000, commonly referred to as Jumbo CDs. We attempt to price our deposit products competitively with other financial institutions in our marketplace to promote deposit growth and satisfy our liquidity requirements and offer a variety of deposit products to satisfy our customers’ needs.
 We provide a wide array of deposit products. We have historically relied upon, and expect to continue to rely upon, deposits to satisfy our needs for sources of funds. We offer regular checking, rewards checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts. We also offer fixed-rate, fixed maturity retail CDs ranging in terms from 30 days to six years, individual retirement accounts and Jumbo CDs. The primary sources of deposits are small and medium sized businesses and individuals within our target market. All deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law. We have a service fee schedule, which we believe is competitive with other financial institutions in our market, covering, among others, maintenance fees on checking accounts, per item processing fees on checking accounts, returned check charges and other similar fees.
 We have a rewards checking deposit product named “MyRate” Checking. This product allows a customer to earn a premium interest rate by meeting certain account requirements, including a minimum monthly amount of electronic transfers and debit card usage and receipt of electronic account statements. Although the rate paid is higher, the overall net costs on this product are lower. 
 We intend to continue our efforts to attract deposits from our business lending relationships in order to reduce our cost of funds and improve our net interest margin. Also, we believe that we have the ability to attract sufficient additional funding by re-pricing the yields on our CDs to meet loan demands during times that growth in core deposits differs from loan demand. To fund loan demand, we have also utilized funding from two programs offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network called Certificate of Deposit Registry Service or CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep or ICS. This relationship allows the Bank to utilize a national network of banks to offer deposit insurance coverage for large depositors. This protection occurs in deposit increments of less than $250,000 per participating bank to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full FDIC insurance. 
 In addition to our traditional marketing methods, we attract new customers and deposits by:
  
• | expanding long-term business customer relationships, including referrals from our customers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deploying personnel to work new leads with loan officers and branch managers to obtain new business customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Borrowings. We may occasionally use our overnight credit to support liquidity needs created by seasonal deposit flows, to temporarily satisfy funding needs from increased loan demand, and for other short-term purposes.  We have an unsecured line of credit with a regional correspondent financial institution pursuant to which we can borrow funds generally on an overnight basis.  The correspondent financial institution may impose collateral requirements or terminate the line of credit at any time.  We have the collateral capacity to borrow from the Federal Reserve. We can also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) pursuant to an existing commitment based on the value of the collateral pledged which generally consists of certain real estate loans and investment securities. (Refer to Note 6 – Short-term Borrowings in the Audited Financial Statements under Item 8 for additional information).  
 Other Products and Services
 We offer a variety of other products and services, including:
  
• | Mobile and Internet Banking. We believe there is a strong demand for mobile and Internet banking. These services allow both consumer and business customers to access detailed account information and manage their accounts, including on-line balance transfers and bill payment. These services enable our customers to conduct their banking business and monitor their bank accounts from remote locations at any time. We believe our mobile and Internet banking services are invaluable in attracting and retaining customers and we encourage customers to consider us for all their banking and financial needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automatic Teller Machines, or ATMs. We provide ATM services at all of our branches and offer ATM fee reimbursement to our customers, allowing them to use certain ATM networks nationwide without paying a per transaction fee. Each checking and deposit account has a monthly reimbursement limit. Our ATMs provide for cash withdrawals, balance transfers and inquiries, and check or cash deposits.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treasury Management Services. We offer cash management systems and services to assist our business customers with their day-to-day funds management. These services include the ability to originate electronic payments and withdrawals, create wire transfers, and request stop payments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Remote Deposit Capture. Branded “ExpressDeposit” and “Merchant Check Capture”, this product allows businesses to send their deposits electronically to the Bank, which allows us to reach a larger group of business customers that are not close to one of our physical locations. We believe this product gives us an edge in gaining new customers and it contributes to the growth of our deposits.

Risk Management
 
We are committed to effectively identifying and managing our overall enterprise risk exposure.  We have identified credit risk, including loan concentrations, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk, including cyber related risks as the areas that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.  In order to mitigate and actively manage these areas of risk, we have established sound procedures and committed experienced personnel to this effort.
 We have focused our risk management in the following areas:
  
• | Our Board established the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee to monitor enterprise risks of the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee assesses enterprise risks and takes appropriate action to mitigate such risks, if necessary;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a dedicated enterprise risk management team that actively monitors enterprise risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Our credit department is staffed to maintain all credit policies and procedures, loan documentation, disbursement of loan proceeds, and manages the integrity of the credit risk rating system;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our finance department is staffed with experienced personnel to manage interest rate and liquidity risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our operations departments include staff experienced in compliance with banking regulations and in information technology and related security issues;

• | Our internal audit department reports its independent audit findings directly to our Board’s Audit and Compliance Committee.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDIC has given guidance recommending that if the sum of (i) certain categories of commercial real estate, or CRE, loans and (ii) acquisition, development and construction, or ADC, loans exceeds 300% of total risk-based capital, or if ADC loans exceed 100% of total risk based capital, heightened risk management practices should be employed to mitigate risk. Our concentration in ADC loans is cyclical and tends to increase in the second and third quarters of each year as demand for ADC loans increases. An increase in ADC loan concentration could cause our ratio for ADC loans to increase and even exceed the FDIC’s guideline. We have exceeded these guidance ratios at times in the past and may do so in the future.  We actively monitor and believe that we effectively manage our CRE and ADC loan concentrations.  If we exceed the FDIC’s guidelines and do not effectively manage the risk of our CRE and ADC loans, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny including a requirement to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.
 Employees
 We refer to our employees as “associates.” We had a total of 459 full-time equivalent associates as of December 31, 2018. Our associates are not represented by a labor organization, and we are not aware of any activity to seek such organization. The Company and the Bank provide their associates with a comprehensive benefit program, including health, dental and vision insurance, life and accident insurance, long-term disability coverage, vacation and sick leave, 401(k) plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and a stock-based compensation plan. The Company considers its associate relations to be excellent. See Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding associate benefit plans and profit sharing.

 Supervision and Regulation  
 The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations that are applicable to us. These summary descriptions are not complete, and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and formal and informal interpretive guidance for more information. Currently applicable statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding interpretative guidance may be adopted. We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on our business or our revenues.
General
 As a Utah registered bank holding company, PUB is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by the UDFI. In addition, as a Utah state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is subject to primary regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and by the UDFI. Supervision, regulation, and examination of PUB and the Bank by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), rather than for holders of our capital stock.
 12


Banking and other financial services statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to PUB and the Bank. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to PUB and the Bank, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on its business or organization. 
 Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which PUB and the Bank are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. 
 While PUB and the Bank will likely remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision, the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework.  For example, on May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was signed into law. Among other regulatory changes, the EGRRCPA amended various sections of the Dodd-Frank Act. The EGRRCPA includes a number of provisions, which are favorable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, and also makes changes to consumer mortgage and credit reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. Because a number of the provisions included in the EGRRCPA require the federal banking agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, it will likely take some time before these provisions are fully implemented.
 Holding Company Regulation
 Permitted Activities
 Under the federal Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire, direct or indirect control of more than five percent of any class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and that is engaged in certain enumerated activities that are related to banking. While the Federal Reserve has treated those activities as acceptable in the past for other bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve in the future may not allow us to conduct any or all of these activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of those activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Acquisitions Subject to Prior Regulatory Approval
 The BHCA requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company or savings association, or to increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding company or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any bank holding company.  In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors, including the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and future prospects (including current and projected capital ratios and levels); the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)); the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In addition, approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquirer satisfies regulatory standards for well-capitalized and well-managed institutions.
 13


Bank Holding Company Obligations to Bank Subsidiaries
 Under current law and Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to maintain resources adequate to support such subsidiaries, which could require PUB to commit resources to support the Bank in situations where additional investments in a bank may not otherwise be warranted. A bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments that qualify as capital under applicable regulatory rules. Any such loan from a holding company to a subsidiary bank is likely to be unsecured and subordinated to the bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. If PUB were to enter bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, under certain circumstances, we may be responsible for the liabilities of the Bank and may be responsible for damages to the FDIC.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends
 The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding dividends is that a bank holding company should not declare or pay a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of any bank subsidiary or which would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Should an insured depository institution controlled by a bank holding company be “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, banking regulators (in the case of the Bank, the FDIC and the UDFI) may choose to require prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. In addition, since we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and do not conduct stand-alone operations, an ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us and the FDIC and the UDFI may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to us from the Bank as described below in “Bank Regulation—Bank Dividends.”
 Capital Regulations – U.S. Basel III Capital Rules
 In July 2013, federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, implementing many aspects of the Basel III Capital Standards. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules impose higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules also increase the risk weight for certain assets, meaning that more capital must be held against such assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150% rather than the current 100%.
 Additionally, the Basel III Capital Standards provide for the deduction of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities); (ii) mortgage-servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We opted out of this treatment.
14


In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of the risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
 For a detailed discussion of PUB and the Bank’s actual capital ratios and capital adequacy, see “Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 9 – Regulatory Capital Matters” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 Bank Regulation
 The Bank is a Utah state-chartered commercial bank, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the UDFI and the FDIC. The UDFI and the FDIC supervise and regulate all areas of the Bank’s operations, including, without limitation, the making of loans, deposit operations, the conduct of the Bank’s corporate affairs, the satisfaction of capital-adequacy requirements, the payment of dividends, and the establishment or closing of banking offices. The UDFI and the FDIC periodically examine the Bank’s operations and financial condition and compliance with federal consumer-protection laws. In addition, the Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain enforcement powers over the Bank.
Capital Adequacy
 See “Holding Company Regulation—Capital Regulations” above.
 Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action
 Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory scheme designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive resolution of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To qualify as a “well capitalized” institution, a bank must have a leverage ratio of no less than 5.0%, a common equity to Tier 1 Capital ratio of no less than 6.5%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of no less than 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10.0%, and a bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Generally, a financial institution must be “well capitalized” before the Federal Reserve will approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank or merge with a bank holding company, and the FDIC applies the same requirement in approving bank merger applications.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met these capital levels.
 Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDIA, which, among other things: (i) restricts payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) requires that the FDIC monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) requires submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restricts the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) requires prior approval of certain expansion proposals. Bank holding companies controlling depository institutions can be called upon to increase the depository institution’s capital and to partially guarantee the institution’s performance under their capital restoration plans. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; (iv) requiring the institution to change and improve its management; (v) prohibiting the acceptance of deposits from correspondent banks; (vi) requiring prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by a bank holding company controlling the institution; and (vii) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
 15


As of December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded the requirements contained in the applicable regulations, policies and directives pertaining to capital adequacy to be classified as “well capitalized.” Rapid growth, poor loan portfolio performance, poor earnings performance, or a combination of these or other factors, could change the Bank’s capital position in a relatively short period of time, making additional capital infusions necessary.  It should be noted that the minimum ratios referred to above in this section are merely guidelines, and the bank regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios.
 Bank Reserves
 The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions, even if not members of the Federal Reserve, to maintain reserves against some deposit accounts. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements. An institution may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window” as a secondary source of funds, provided that the institution meets the Federal Reserve Bank’s credit standards.
Bank Dividends
 Utah law places restrictions on the declaration of dividends by Utah state-chartered banks to their shareholders. This may decrease any amount available for the payment of dividends in a particular period if the surplus funds for the Bank fail to comply with this limitation. The FDIC and the UDFI may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to PUB from the Bank. Utah corporate law also requires that dividends can only be paid out of funds legally available therefor.
Limitations on Brokered Deposits
 Applicable rules regarding capital requirements under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations limit the ability of banks to raise funds that meet the definition of “brokered deposits” under that regulation. To avoid the applicability of this limitation, the Bank must maintain the status of a “well capitalized” institution.
Insurance of Accounts and Other Assessments
 FDIC deposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank. The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 The Bank is subject to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA, and the Federal Reserve’s implementing Regulation W. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Bank. Accordingly, certain asset transactions and contracts, between PUB, the Bank and any non-bank subsidiaries are subject to a number of restrictions. All such transactions, as well as contracts entered into between the Bank and affiliates, must be on terms that are no less favorable to the Bank than those that would be available from non-affiliated third parties.
 Loans to Insiders
 Loans to executive officers, directors or principal shareholders are subject to restrictions under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and the Federal Reserve’s implementing Regulation O (collectively, “Reg. O”). From time to time, the Bank makes loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders on terms permitted by Reg. O. We believe the Bank is in compliance with Reg. O and, therefore, we believe we are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). All loans from the Bank to executive officers, directors or principal shareholders are made in the ordinary course of business, are of a type generally made available to the public and are on market terms no more favorable than those offered to persons not related to the Bank, except for the waiver of certain loan fees and a minor reduction in certain loan interest rates as part of a benefit program as allowed by Reg. O.
 16


Change in Control
 Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act require prior approval from the Federal Reserve and/or the FDIC for any person or company to acquire “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities, and in general is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10 percent or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities. In certain cases, a company may also be presumed to have control under the BHCA if it acquires 5% or more of any class of voting securities. Control may also be deemed to exist where a person or company is found to hold “controlling influence” over a bank or bank holding company.
Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA and its implementing regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The prudential bank regulatory agencies are required to assign and make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA as either “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance.” The federal banking agencies consider a bank’s CRA rating when a bank submits an application to establish banking centers, merge, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of all banks involved in the merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other financial holding company. A less-than-satisfactory rating can substantially delay, block or impose conditions on the transaction. In its last CRA examination, the Bank received a rating of “satisfactory.”
In April 2018, the United States Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. Leaders of the federal banking agencies recently have indicated their support for revising the CRA regulatory framework, and on August 28, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit ideas for building a new CRA framework. While the OCC does not have supervisory authority over PUB or the Bank, the OCC has stated that it hopes to build the new CRA framework jointly with the Federal Reserve and FDIC.
 Interstate Branching
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”) provides that adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks in any state. In addition, banks are permitted to establish branches in any state if that state permits the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state, although setting up a branch remains subject to applicable regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal requirements.
 Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats. This has been implemented through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, or the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act imposed new requirements that obligate financial institutions, such as banks, to take certain steps to monitor and control the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
 Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:
  
• | internal policies, procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the bank’s compliance with all of the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA and related laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | a designated compliance officer;
--+---------------------------------


• | employee training;
--+-------------------


• | an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | procedures to verify the identity of each customer upon the opening of accounts; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | heightened due diligence policies, procedures and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP, as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods. Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Financial institutions are also required to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC consider an applicant’s effectiveness in combating money laundering, among other factors, in connection with an application to approve a bank merger or acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company.
 Likewise, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with the subjects of U.S. sanctions, as defined by various Executive Orders, laws, regulations, treaties, and related interpretations. OFAC assembles and provides lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify appropriate authorities.
 The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and OFAC regulations.
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority
 Federal and state banking laws grant substantial enforcement powers to federal and state banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and “institution-affiliated parties,” such as management, employees and agents. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. When issued by a banking regulator, cease and desist and similar orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A bank may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering regulatory agency.
Loan Concentrations
 The FDIC has issued guidance recommending that if certain categories of commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans and acquisition, development and construction (“ADC”) loans exceed certain thresholds, then heightened risk management practices should be employed to mitigate risk. As of December 31, 2018, our ADC loans to Tier 2 capital were 113.2%, which exceeded the threshold set by the FDIC. We have exceeded these thresholds at times in the past and may do so again in the future. If we exceed the thresholds and do not manage the risk of our CRE and ADC loans, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, such as a requirement to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.
 18


Federal Home Loan Bank System
 The Bank is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines.
 Privacy and Data Security
 Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions.  Under the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The GLBA also directed federal regulators to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach.
Other federal and state laws and regulations impact the Company’s and the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers.
 Like other lenders, the Bank uses credit bureau data in its underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Company and the Bank.
 Cybersecurity
 The federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC and related self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cybersecurity risk management among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish lines of defense and to ensure that its risk management processes also address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to a cyberattack.
 To control cyber-security risk, we maintain active information security programs that are designed to conform with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) guidance. These information security programs are aligned with our operational risks and are overseen by executive management, and the Board. These programs involve the assessment of risks, continual monitoring and review of threats, the evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to mitigate risks, and review of incident response plans for each identified threat. We also utilize appropriate cybersecurity insurance that controls against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk.
 Further, we recognize our role in the overall industry, and have adopted a comprehensive National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cyber Security Framework. We also fully participate in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond our risk control thresholds. Although we invest substantial time and resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk.
 We believe that effective management of operational risk, defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, plays a major role in both the level and the stability of our profitability. Our Enterprise Risk Management department oversees an enterprise-wide framework intended to identify, assess, control, monitor, and report on operational risks. These processes support our goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.
 19


Consumer Laws and Regulations
 The Bank is also subject to a number of other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the FRCA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when offering consumer financial products and services.
 Rulemaking authority for most federal consumer-financial-protection laws rests with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, or UDAAP, and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate the prohibition on UDAAP, certain aspects of these standards are untested, and thus it is currently not possible to predict how the CFPB will exercise this authority.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. The rules also impose both underwriting standards and limits on the terms, including pricing, of such loans. In 2014, the CFPB adopted regulations that combine mortgage disclosures required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its implementing Regulation X, and the Truth-in-Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z. This new disclosure scheme required mortgage lenders such as the Bank to substantially revise their loan-origination and disclosure systems in order to comply with the new regulations. The Bank has implemented necessary modifications in order to meet these requirements. Portions of a significant expansion of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and its implementing Regulation C took effect in 2018.
 Other Dodd-Frank Act Reforms
 Volcker Rule
 The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, and their affiliates, such as PUB, from (i) engaging in “proprietary trading,” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds, or covered funds, in each case subject to certain limited exceptions. The final rules impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities.
 In May 2018, the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the Volcker Rule released a proposal to revise the Volcker Rule. The proposal would tailor the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide the federal agencies. If adopted, the proposed changes to the definition of a trading account would likely expand the scope of investing and trading activities subject to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions.
 PUB is reviewing the scope of any compliance program that may be required but is of the view that the impact of the Volcker Rule will not be material to its business operations.
 Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say-on-pay” vote in their proxy statement by which shareholders may vote on the compensation of the public company’s named executive officers. In addition, if such public companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, shareholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction. Other provisions of the act may impact our corporate governance. In addition, the act requires the SEC to adopt rules requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt claw-back policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. We are an “Emerging Growth Company” under the JOBS Act and therefore subject to reduced disclosure requirements related to executive compensation.

Future Legislative and Regulatory Developments
 Various legislative acts are from time to time enacted by Congress or by the Utah Legislature. Additionally, regulatory agencies frequently modify or create new regulations and guidance. Such acts and modifications or new regulation and guidance may change the environment in which PUB and the Bank operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine the ultimate impact that potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations and guidance with respect thereto, would have upon PUB’s or the Bank’s financial condition or results of operations. 
State Corporate Law Restrictions
 As Utah corporations, PUB and the Bank are subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Utah corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Utah include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors; distributions to shareholders; transactions involving directors, officers, or interested shareholders; maintenance of books, records, and minutes; and observance of certain corporate formalities.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
 Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation, combating recession, and facilitating the national debt. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
