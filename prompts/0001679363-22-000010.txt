ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company applying our proprietary insights into integrins to discover and develop a pipeline of potentially first-in-class oral small molecule integrin therapeutics. Integrins are a target class with multiple approved injectable blockbuster drugs for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. To date, no oral small molecule integrin therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Despite this, we believe our unique platform can unlock the potential to reliably generate high-quality oral molecules against specific integrin targets. The Morphic integrin technology platform, or MInT Platform, was created leveraging our unique understanding of integrin structure and function to develop novel product candidates designed to achieve the potency, high selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties required for oral administration. We are advancing our pipeline, including our lead product candidate, MORF-057, an α4β7-specific integrin inhibitor affecting inflammation, into clinical development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for MORF-057 in July 2020, and the FDA permitted the study submitted under the IND to proceed in August 2020. In September 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of MORF-057 in healthy volunteers comprised of single-ascending dose, or SAD, food effect, and multiple-ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts to establish our clinical program and select doses for our Phase 2 program in IBD with an initial focus on ulcerative colitis, or UC. 
The MORF-057 Phase 1 study included single ascending dose (SAD), multiple ascending dose (MAD), and food effect (FE) cohorts evaluating MORF-057 safety, PK, and PD. Healthy subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of MORF-057 at 25, 50, 100, 150 and 400 mg or matching placebo in the SAD cohorts; or twice daily (BID) doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg MORF-057 or matching placebo for a total of 14 days in the MAD cohorts. A total of 67 eligible healthy subjects were enrolled into the studies, with 36 in the SAD, nine in the FE and 22 in the MAD cohorts. 66 subjects completed study treatment and one from the 50 mg BID MAD cohort withdrew consent for personal reasons.
MORF-057 was well tolerated in all cohorts and no safety signals were identified. MORF-057 demonstrated a favorable PK profile, where target engagement was confirmed, and a clear PK and PD relationship was established. MORF-057 was rapidly absorbed and systemic exposure was confirmed to increase approximately dose proportionally. A slight reduction in exposure without effect on trough concentrations was observed upon administration with a high fat meal in the food effect study. The results suggest food intake has no impact on trough MORF-057 levels and that MORF-057 can be administered without regard to food in planned studies in patients.
α4β7 receptor occupancy increased with dose and study day, achieving saturation (>99% RO) in individual patients from all cohorts above 25 mg by day 14. In the 100 mg BID cohort, MORF-057 saturated the α4β7 receptor (mean RO >99%). Dose-and time-dependent changes in biomarkers including specific α4β7 high expressing immune cell populations were observed, adding to evidence of proof of biology for MORF-057. These changes were consistent with those reported with other integrin inhibitors including the antibody drug vedolizumab which is approved for the treatment of IBD.
Based on the results from the Phase 1 studies, we are now finalizing preparations for Phase 2 clinical trials of MORF-057 to begin in 2022. This program is planned to include a Phase 2a open-label trial and a Phase 2b global, randomized controlled trial.
We have also developed selective oral αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and additional indications under our collaboration with AbbVie, entered into in October 2018, or the AbbVie Agreement. In August 2020, AbbVie exercised an option to license our αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitor program, and made a one-time $20.0 million payment to us. Under this license, AbbVie controls and is responsible for the development and commercialization of this program. AbbVie has informed us that it does not intend to advance any of our selective oral αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitors due to a suspected on-target/ αvβ6-mediated safety signal that has been observed in pre-clinical testing. Details about these observations are planned to be released in an upcoming scientific publication. As a result, we do not expect to receive additional payments for this program under the AbbVie Agreement. We continue to advance additional discovery programs with AbbVie as a part of this collaboration. 
Beyond these lead targets, we are using our MInT Platform to advance a broad pipeline of preclinical programs across a variety of therapeutic areas, all of which aim to harness the potential of inhibition or activation of an integrin receptor. One example of a wholly-owned program is our αvβ8 inhibitor program in oncology for which we are targeting an IND filing in the next 12 to 18 months. We also have additional research stage programs ongoing against integrin targets in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and other therapeutic areas. 
Integrins are a family of transmembrane cell adhesion proteins that localize cells in specific tissues and then modulate cellular functions in response to these environments. They are the only receptors that can “integrate” extracellular and intracellular stimuli. Integrins contain two subunits: one protein in the integrin dimer comes from the α family and one from the β family. Combinations of various α and β subunits form 24 integrins that are subdivided across four receptor subgroups: those on leukocytes, and those that recognize RGD-peptide, collagen and laminin ligands. Their activity is modulated by the complexity of their conformational states. Tissues have distinct integrin expressions and these integrins play a role in autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. We believe the diversity and specificity of integrin involvement in a broad range of diseases make this set of molecules ideal drug targets.
Based on the broad therapeutic potential of integrin inhibition and activation and the productivity of our MInT Platform, we have made the strategic decision to retain full commercial rights to certain compounds and indications in our development pipeline while selectively collaborating on the development of those that do not match our current resources or therapeutic focus. The AbbVie Agreement was designed to advance a number of our oral integrin programs for fibrosis-related indications, which included an upfront payment of $100.0 million to us to provide research and development activities. The AbbVie Agreement also provided AbbVie with exclusive license options on product candidates directed at several targets, including an option to our αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitor program, which they exercised in August 2020. AbbVie has informed us that it does not intend to advance any of our selective oral αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitors due to a suspected on-target/ αvβ6-mediated safety signal that has been observed in pre-clinical testing. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, to develop novel integrin therapeutics, and in December 2020 we agreed with Janssen to commence work on a third research program and Janssen agreed to pay us $5.0 million as a commencement fee. In December 2021, Janssen informed us that they have decided not to exercise the options on the first two integrin targets. We have focused efforts on the third integrin research program which includes the potential development of integrin antibody activators. The first two integrin targets are being returned to us due to a lack of target validation in the specific disease of Janssen's interest. In the aggregate, we are now eligible to receive up to $253 million from the collaboration in upfront, option 
and milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales. We believe these collaborations further validate the transformational potential of our MInT Platform.
We were founded in 2014 by Dr. Timothy A. Springer of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, a world-renowned immunologist and biophysicist who discovered integrins. He established the importance of integrin conformations in modulating disease activity. Today, pursuant to an exclusive license from the Children’s Medical Center Corporation, or the Springer Laboratory, our MInT platform is powered by these initial insights, together with our proprietary knowledge of integrin conformations, affinity regulation and dynamics. Together, this enables us to discover novel product candidates that bind and revert disease-specific integrin conformations to a non-disease physiologic state.
We have assembled an experienced management team, board of directors and scientific advisory board with specialized expertise in integrin therapies. They collectively bring extensive experience in discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics, having worked at companies such as ArQule, Inc., Biogen Inc., Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., and Pharmacia Corporation.
Since our inception, we have raised $698.7 million in gross proceeds from equity financings, including our initial public offering in July 2019, and collaboration payments.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to use our MInT Platform to discover and develop potentially first-in-class oral small-molecule integrin therapeutics. We believe our platform has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from a broad range of serious chronic diseases. The key tenets of our business strategy to achieve this goal include:
•Establishing orally available integrin modulators as a new treatment for serious chronic diseases, including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. We are leveraging our MInT Platform to create a new class of oral integrin targeted therapeutics to treat diseases where integrins are dysregulated and a potential benefit for oral therapies exists. We have prioritized our initial development efforts on diseases with established clinical endpoints and biomarkers, which we believe will enable us to more rapidly achieve clinical proof of concept. We are advancing our lead wholly-owned product candidate, MORF-057, an α4β7 specific integrin inhibitor, through clinical development for the treatment of IBD.
•Leveraging our proprietary MInT Platform and knowledge base to grow our pipeline of novel integrin therapeutics. Our comprehensive MInT Platform, coupled with our development capabilities, have enabled us to build a pipeline of novel product candidates targeting chronic diseases caused by integrin dysregulation. We intend to expand our pipeline by unlocking the therapeutic potential of the four integrin subgroups to treat diseases with high unmet medical need and to potentially expand our current product candidates into new indications.
•Continuing to drive innovation across our MInT Platform. We intend to extend our leading position in the field of integrin medicine by continuing to develop and incorporate platform innovations that can further broaden the potential therapeutic reach of our oral integrin programs. Our key focus areas include iteratively expanding the breadth of our structural knowledge in crystallography through technological investments, broadening our library of conformationally-specific integrin chemotypes and deepening our fundamental understanding of integrin disease biology. We believe that as we further expand our knowledge base, we will be able to iteratively grow our platform and deepen our understanding of additional integrin targets.
•Independently commercializing our products, if approved, in indications and geographies where we believe we can realize maximum value. We plan to independently advance those product candidates that we believe have well-defined clinical and regulatory approval pathways, and that we believe we can commercialize successfully, if approved. We may also seek to form strategic collaborations around certain targets, product candidates or disease areas that we believe could benefit from the resources of either larger biopharmaceutical companies or those specialized in a particular area. Our current collaborations with AbbVie and Janssen exemplify various aspects of this strategy.
Our Focus — Integrin Receptors
Integrins are the only receptors in the human body that use both intracellular and extracellular ligands to transmit signals both from inside of the cell to the outside of the cell and from the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell. Reciprocally, these states are regulated by tensile forces transmitted through integrins when they bind to extracellular ligands and the intracellular cytoskeleton. This bi-directional signaling ability allows integrins to affect virtually every aspect of cell and organ homeostasis. Consequently, the dysregulation of integrin signaling is associated with many human diseases including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer.
Integrin receptors are evolutionarily conserved. Integrins exist as paired combinations of 18 α and eight β subunits resulting in 24 known heterodimers. These pairings give integrins their unique abilities to recognize their ligands and modulate cellular function in specific ways. Integrins are subdivided into those on leukocytes, and those that recognize RGD-peptide, collagen and laminin ligands. They regulate numerous aspects of cell biology and physiology including leukocyte trafficking, activation of platelets and leukocytes, activation of growth factors such as TGF-β, cell adhesion to the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and retention or adhesion strengthening of cells within tissues. This diverse set of functions makes them actionable targets across a broad range of human diseases based on preclinical modeling or clinical establishment. The figure below summarizes the 24-member integrin family and areas of clinical relevance:
Integrins as a Therapeutic Target Family
Integrins have long been recognized as drug targets. In the 1980s, the therapeutic interrogation of integrins focused on the RGD integrin, αIIbβ3. When αIIbβ3 on platelets is activated, it binds to fibrin, which bridges it to adjacent platelets and leads to clot formation. As the molecular details establishing the essential role of αIIbβ3 in platelet aggregation emerged, it became clear that inhibition of its ligand binding function would be antithrombotic. In 1994, abciximab (marketed as ReoPro®) became the first 
approved integrin therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, followed by the approval of tirofiban (marketed as Aggrastat®) and eptifibatide (marketed as Integrilin®).
The next stage of development of integrins as drug targets has focused on integrin receptors on leukocytes. These therapies modulate autoimmunity by inhibiting the ability of activated immune cells, including T-cells, to enter chronically inflamed tissues. Four approved integrin medicines belong to this category:
•Efalizumab (formerly marketed as Raptiva® and subsequently withdrawn from the market), an injectable antibody inhibitor of αLβ2, approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe psoriasis;
•Natalizumab (marketed as Tysabri®), an infusible antibody inhibitor of α4β1, approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and in 2008 for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease;
•Vedolizumab (marketed as Entyvio®), an infusible antibody inhibitor of α4β7, approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease; and
•Lifitegrast (marketed as Xiidra®), a topical small-molecule inhibitor of αLβ2, approved by the FDA in 2016 for the treatment of dry eye disease.
According to Global Data, these autoimmune therapies were estimated to have achieved combined annual sales in their respective 2020 fiscal years of approximately $6.4 billion.
Development Challenges of Oral Integrin Modulators
The infusible, injectable or topical nature of these therapies has limited their utility. To address these limitations, pharmaceutical companies have invested significant resources in discovering and developing oral systemic integrin therapies. For αIIbβ3 alone, six different compounds (roxifiban, sibrafiban, orbofiban, xemilofiban, lefradafiban, lotrafiban) were advanced into registrational Phase 3 clinical trials. Disappointingly, the results of these trials showed these oral systemic inhibitors of αIIbβ3 increased vascular death in patients with acute coronary syndrome. After a decade to understand these failures, we now know that all failed oral inhibitors stabilized the active integrin conformation and promoted ligand signaling if they were not potent enough to maintain full active site binding. These drawbacks resulted in greater platelet aggregation and an increased rate of adverse events.
Additionally, the unexpected disease-activating activity of oral leukocyte integrin inhibitors was observed during a Phase 2 development of firategrast, an oral non-selective inhibitor of α4β1 and α4β7, where the symptoms in the patients with multiple sclerosis were exacerbated when firategrast was administered in non-saturating doses. This resulted in an increase in lesions and an increased rate of adverse events. The development of this compound was subsequently halted.
Our Platform and Approach
We believe that our MInT Platform allows us to address and overcome the challenges faced by developers of first-generation oral integrin-targeted therapeutics.
Integrin Model
We believe that our discovery platform enables us to be the only company working across the entire 24-member integrin target family. Our MInT Platform consists of these unique capabilities:
•Proprietary ability to determine integrin structures. Using our protein constructs, cell lines and know-how, we have elucidated over 400 proprietary structures for clinically important targets across the integrin class.
•A computationally enabled product candidate design engine. We have built a library of over 15,000 optimized compounds using sophisticated medicinal and computational chemistry capabilities and biological assays for each integrin that allows us to tune highly potent and selective integrin inhibitors and activators into product candidates for preclinical and clinical development. Our ability to generate product candidates from our tunable product engine is significantly accelerated by our exclusive computational collaboration with Schrödinger, which uses advanced physics-based modeling and machine learning to create superior oral drug candidates. 
•An emerging ability to discover activating and inhibiting antibody candidates, by leveraging our unique ability to express and isolate specific integrin conformational constructs.
•Biology and disease translation capability. Our sophisticated and comprehensive suite of biologic tools includes a gene and protein expression atlas, a single-cell resolution profiling of human tissues from diseases of interest and development of biomarkers, which allow us to assess target engagement and pharmacodynamic activity in the disease of interest.
We initially focused on developing product candidates with a target class for areas of high unmet medical needs including:
•α4β7 and α4β1, which are established targets for autoimmune diseases; their mechanism of action and the benefits and risks of their inhibition are well understood; and
•certain αv integrins that have a preclinically well-characterized mechanism of action through the activation of TGF-β, a clinically important anti-inflammatory cytokine dysregulated in many human pathologies.
To date, we have only tested MORF-057, an α4β7-specific integrin inhibitor, in clinical studies, and we currently only have pre-clinical data regarding oral bioavailability of our other product candidates.
Our understanding of the mechanism of integrin receptor activity, modulated by complex conformations and signaling, is unique and allows us to discover both inhibitors and activators across the integrin receptor target family. Our capability has been validated by our advancement of αvβ6 and α4β7 programs, as well as our collaborations with AbbVie and Janssen. Our MInT Platform consists of three major components:
•Proprietary ability to determine integrin structures;
•Tunable product candidate design engine; and
•Biology and disease translation capability.
Leveraging our deep understanding of integrin conformation and molecular modes of action is a key element of our strategy to identify product candidates. These receptors undergo large conformational changes as shown in Figure 1, resulting in both inactive (bent-closed and extended-closed) and activated states of the receptor (extended-open). In the bent-closed form, the top portion of the integrin, formed by both α and β subunits, folds in half so that the top and lower half associate with each other (Figure 1 left) rendering the integrin inactive. For the integrin to be active, the extended-close state (Figure 1 middle) extends at the α and β mid-leg on the cell surface to render an extended open state (Figure 1 right). As shown with multiple integrins, the bent-closed and extended-closed conformations have low affinities for ligand, while depending on the integrin, the extended-open conformation is 700 to 5,000-fold higher in affinity for ligand. These changes in integrin conformation and affinity function to transmit bi-directional signals, enabling communication of the cell expressing the integrin on its surface and the extracellular matrix or ligands on other cells.
Figure 1: Integrin dynamic conformational states. Left — bent-closed inactive form of the integrin heterodimer pair, Middle — extended-closed inactive, and Right — extended-open active.
Our novel MInT Platform is rooted in our structural biology capability based on deep insights into control of complex integrin conformational states. Dr. Springer characterized an initial set of small molecules to lock specific integrin conformations and we have used and advanced this knowledge to optimize the pharmacology of our oral integrins. We design our compounds to recognize integrin conformational states that are physiologic dysregulated in disease. Binding of our compounds to integrins promotes the integrin to adopt a structure that is characteristic of healthy tissue and stops disease-specific integrin signaling. We believe past attempts to develop small molecules targeting integrins have in part failed due to a lack of sufficient understanding of these conformational changes and their impact on disease. We believe our MInT Platform has positioned us to apply our deep understanding of the biologic underpinnings of diseases linked to integrin dysfunction to develop a pipeline of novel integrin therapeutics.
The Morphic Integrin Technology (MInT) Platform
Given that the integrin target family consists of structurally and functionally related proteins, each cycle of the MInT Platform yields chemistry assets and biological data in our programs of interest while in parallel furthering our understanding of the 
structure and function of new integrin complexes. We believe this results in a rapid strategic compounding of knowledge and assets with each turn of the MInT design cycle. Our α4β7 program produced its first development candidate over three years after program initiation. Our αvβ6 program took only two years to achieve the same goal, which we believe was due in part to insights we had gained on chemical features that optimized oral bioavailability, clearance and metabolic stability. Our αvβ8 program has advanced even faster to development candidate profile compounds. The chemotypes and initial medicinal chemistry hits we discover become tools and compounds that can further our knowledge base around each individual integrin, which also extends to related integrins. For example, discovery efforts in αvβ6 led to highly selective αvβ8 advanced leads and starting points for additional targets, directly enabling new wholly-owned programs and supporting collaboration efforts.
As shown in the graphic below, the iterative MInT design cycle consists of nine steps based on the three pillars of our MInT Platform: our proprietary ability to determine integrin structures, our tunable product candidate design engine, and our biology and disease translation capability.
Proprietary ability to determine integrin structures
We believe that an understanding of protein crystal structures enables more effective product candidate design. Integrins are difficult to characterize structurally because they are composed of many flexible domains and interdomain linkers (see Figure 1). Our unique position of integrin structural knowledge and cell lines, and access to crystal structures for half of the integrin targets, proprietary protein reagents and knowhow has allowed us to elucidate over 400 proprietary structures for clinically important targets. Our novel approach is based on combining our deep understanding of structural biology and how integrin 
protein conformation regulates function in disease. An example of this is in our α4β7 program where the crystal structure of the drug binding site enables the design of novel ligands that bind at the interface of the α and β subunits (Figure 2). This critical information at the molecular level directs our research to unlock the potential of this family of receptors and develop small molecules for targeting specific conformations of the integrin receptors.
Figure 2: Left — X-ray crystal structural of the top portion of the heterodimer or headpiece of the human α 4β7 integrin receptor with the α-subunit on the left and β-subunit on the right. The drug binding site for this receptor is at the interface of the α and β subunits. Right — Zoomed in view of the drug binding site showing the key interactions responsible for regulation of protein conformation in this integrin.

Cell Biol. 196, 131-146.
Tunable product candidate design engine
Proprietary Chemistry: We have significant know-how in the development of molecules that stabilize specific integrin receptor conformations, which supports our novel approach to the identification of oral integrin inhibitors. Today, our small molecule chemical library, which continues to grow, contains over 15,000 uniquely designed integrin modulators (inhibitors and activators), and our drug design technology leverages our proprietary understanding of integrin target dynamics. When coupled with our deep understanding of the molecular mode of action of specific integrins, we believe we can design appropriate chemotypes for each integrin function. Further optimization of library compounds, combined with excellence in medicinal chemistry, enables the identification of potent, selective oral small molecule product candidates.
Exclusive Schrödinger Computational Chemistry Collaboration: We have a collaboration with Schrödinger, a leader in chemical simulation and in silico drug discovery, that is exclusive as to integrins. We believe this collaboration enables us to undertake accelerated drug discovery through design, iteration and optimization of leads using a variety of next-generation physics-based computational technologies. Our collaboration with Schrödinger enables us to design molecules with atomic precision utilizing advanced structure-guided drug design technology.
Our In Vitro Integrin Assay Panels: To identify novel inhibitors that stabilize disease-relevant receptor conformations, we have established a suite of robust in vitro assays that cover a majority of integrin family members. These proprietary in-house screening assays enable biochemical and functional characterization of potency and selectivity within the integrin family, serving as powerful tools in different stages of the drug design process.
Biology and disease translation capability
The MInT Platform is built upon a deep understanding of integrin biology in human diseases, including integrin tissues and a cell expression atlas. We have built a sophisticated and comprehensive suite of in vitro, ex vivo, and disease-specific in vivo assays designed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of integrin modulation and to gain additional insights into their mechanism of action. The biological learnings from these assays have the potential to accelerate our work across multiple integrin discovery programs. We hope to strategically translate preclinical observations into our clinical development plans. These, along with our growing capabilities in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, have enabled our discovery of integrin inhibitors that have the potential to impact human diseases of autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer.
Our Pipeline Programs
We have conducted an analysis of opportunities for integrin inhibition in human disease based on validating biology, safety, technology readiness and development feasibility. We have identified several actionable integrin targets across all four integrin families, and our initial focus is in high unmet medical need areas of autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. The following table summarizes key information about our current product candidates:
Our Lead Product Candidates
MORF-057: Our α4β7-specific Integrin Inhibitor for Inflammatory Bowel Disease
We are advancing our lead α4β7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 as a potential oral treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, two of the most common types of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. Current IBD medical management strategies focus on inducing and maintaining disease remission with corticosteroids, immunomodulators and injectable monoclonal antibody therapies. We believe our oral integrins have the potential, if approved, to offer a targeted, safe, efficacious, and more convenient method of treatment for patients suffering from IBD.
Background on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
IBD comprises several autoimmune and immune-mediated conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In ulcerative colitis, inflammation is limited to the lining of the colon, whereas in Crohn’s disease, inflammation can segmentally affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract but extend through the entire thickness of the bowel wall. Symptoms of these conditions include persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue. Approved biologic medications for moderate-severe IBD have a primary induction non-response rate of up to 30 percent, and up to 45 percent of patients lose response over time; as such even newer agents may not adequately control tissue inflammation 
or symptoms for many of the sicker patients, and some will therefore develop complications that require surgical removal of the colon and rectum. According to a report by the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, as of November 2014, there were approximately 907,000 people living with ulcerative colitis and 780,000 with Crohn’s disease, with 38,000 and 33,000 new cases diagnosed per year, respectively, in the United States. 
The mainstays of IBD therapy over many years have been oral and topical salicylates and glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibody therapies. Anti-integrin antibody therapy for IBD was first introduced with the approval of the α4 integrin inhibitor natalizumab for Crohn’s disease, an indication approved following its initial approval for multiple sclerosis. Natalizumab therapy is associated with, and carries a black box warning for, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, related to its α4β1 inhibitory activity, which has limited its use in Crohn’s disease. PML is a rare and often fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage of the white matter of the brain at multiple locations. Vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the integrin α4β7, is approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and does not carry a black box warning.
Overview of Pathway and Target Biology
Integrin α4β7 binds to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule, or MAdCAM, which is expressed at a high level almost exclusively on the endothelial cells of the gut. Blockade of this interaction prevents immune cell entry into inflamed tissue in the gut and has been shown to be effective in treating IBD, as evidenced by the approval of vedolizumab.
Our Solution
We have generated oral small molecule integrin therapeutics targeting α4β7 intended to treat patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Our strategy is driven by our ability to discover oral therapies and our knowledge of how to minimize off target risk of inhibiting α4β1, which is implicated in PML. We believe this program represents an example of a target class with opportunities to differentiate from established therapies, utilizing our MInT Platform. We believe that safe and effective oral therapies have the potential to transform the lives of IBD patients in two distinct ways: (i) as an earlier line of therapy, and (ii) in combination with other agents in the IBD landscape.
Preclinical Data, Pharmacology and Biomarker Data
Using our proprietary MInT Platform, we have designed α4β7 small molecule-inhibitors, including MORF-057, that are potent and have high selectivity for α4β7 relative to other integrins, including α4β1 and αEβ7, as assessed by a suite of in vitro assays. Table 1 below shows measurements of the potency of MORF-057 as assessed in our cell adhesion assays, as compared to reference products vedolizumab, natalizumab and etrolizumab, as well as AJM300, a product candidate being developed by a third party. We determined all of these potencies in our laboratories. The cell adhesion assay evaluated the ability of α4β7 to bind to its ligand MAdCAM, α4β1 to its ligand VCAM, and αEβ7 to its ligand E-cadherin in vitro. These assays have been shown to be useful in discovering drug candidates for IBD. IC50 values are commonly accepted measurements of drug potency.
MORF-057 has been observed to be a highly potent α4β7 inhibitor with >3,000-fold selectivity in our cell adhesion assay- as compared to α4β1 and αEβ7.

The in vivo activity of our α4β7 inhibitor was also evaluated in a single dose acute pharmacodynamic model, where the impact of blocking the α4β7 integrin on the trafficking of T lymphocytes to the gut was assessed in mice. The procedure of the T lymphocyte homing uses fluorescently labelled TK1 cells, which expresses high level of α4β7 integrin on the surface and an n of 5 animals per group. Several of our compounds, including our development candidate MORF-057, have been evaluated in this assay to assess dose response (Figure 3). We observed a statistically significant response at all doses tested, and at the three highest doses tested, we observed our compound to be as potent as DATK32, a mouse surrogate of the α4β7 antibody vedolizumab. In Figure 3 below, the right panel shows dose-dependent inhibition of the carboxyflourescein succinimidyl ester, or CFSE, labeled T cells homing to mesenteric lymph nodes observed with our small molecule α4β7 inhibitor and DATK32, a mouse surrogate of vedolizumab in the assay. All treatment groups showed a statistically significant difference (***p<0.0001) compared to vehicle, using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. MORF-057 exhibited good in vitro permeability, resulting in high oral exposure in multiple preclinical models. In addition, MORF-057 has a low to moderate clearance and moderate half-life in animal species, supporting twice daily use in human. 
Figure 3. The left panel on the left shows the mechanism of the α4β7expressing lymphocytes in IBD. The α4β7expressing lymphocytes traffic to the gut and adhere to MAdCAM, followed by extravasation and migration to the inflammation site. The panel on the right shows the results of the in vivo assay to detect activity of our product candidates as compared to a mouse surrogate of vedolizumab.
MORF-057 has also been shown to inhibit α4β7 CD4+ T cell trafficking to mucosal sites in a non-human primate model. In this model inhibition of the trafficking of cells to the intestine was monitored indirectly by observing their resulting increase in systemic circulation. Figure 4 below shows that MORF-057 dosed orally twice daily increases the level of T memory cells in circulation in a statistically significant manner. 
Figure 4: Fold change in % α4β7 high T memory cells following oral dosing of MORF-057 in non-human primate. Means and SD of data normalized per individual at timepoint 0h (first dose administration). T test analysis was performed at each timepoint. Statistical significance determined using the Holm-Sidak method, with alpha = 0.05. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
Translational biomarkers such as receptor occupancy, or RO, have been validated as a pharmacodynamics marker in preclinical studies and early clinical trials of vedolizumab. When a product candidate binds to α4β7, it occupies the integrin ligand binding site and interferes with the ability of MAdCAM to bind and contribute to immune cell accumulation into the inflamed gut tissue. An assay that measures binding of the product candidate to α4β7 in lymphocytes in circulating blood is termed a blood based α4β7 RO assay. Free α4β7 and α4β1 signal intensities were inhibited by increasing concentrations of MORF-057. The results in Figure 5 also show that MORF-057 is highly potent and selective for α4β7. The RO assay exhibits almost identical performance between healthy subjects and UC patients.

Clinical Development Overview
Phase 1
In September 2020, we announced the initiation of a healthy volunteer Phase 1 clinical trial, with SAD, food effect and MAD cohorts to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of MORF-057. 
In March 2021, we announced preliminary results from the Phase 1 SAD clinical trial of MORF-057 demonstrating that MORF-057 was well tolerated in all dose cohorts ranging from 25 mg to 400 mg, achieved greater than 95% mean receptor occupancy of α4β7 integrin at the three highest dose levels, and demonstrated the potential to saturate the α4β7 receptor with oral administration. 
In July 2021, after completion of the MAD and food effect portions of the MORF-057 clinical program, we reported the full data set from the Phase 1 clinical trial at the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 2021 Virtual Congress. The full MORF-057 Phase 1 study included single ascending dose (SAD), multiple ascending dose (MAD), and food effect (FE) cohorts evaluating MORF-057 safety, PK, and PD. Healthy subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of MORF-057 at 25, 50, 100, 150 and 400 mg or matching placebo in the SAD cohorts; or twice daily (BID) doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg MORF-057 or matching placebo for a total of 14 days in the MAD cohorts. A total of 67 eligible healthy subjects were enrolled into the studies.
MORF-057 was well tolerated in all cohorts and no safety signals were identified. MORF-057 demonstrated a favorable PK profile, where target engagement was confirmed, and a clear PK and PD relationship was established. MORF-057 was rapidly absorbed and systemic exposure was confirmed to increase approximately dose proportionally. The FE results suggest food intake has no impact on trough MORF-057 levels and that MORF-057 can be administered without regard to food in planned studies in patients.
Figure 6: Receptor Occupancy with dose and study day, achieving saturation (>99%) in individuals in each cohort above 25 mg.
α4β7 receptor occupancy increased with dose and study day, achieving saturation (>99% RO) (Figure 6) in individual patients from all cohorts above 25 mg by day 14. In the 100 mg BID cohort, MORF-057 saturated the α4β7 receptor (mean RO >99%) at all measured timepoints. Dose-and time-dependent changes in biomarkers including specific α4β7 high expressing immune cell populations were observed, adding to evidence of proof of biology for MORF-057 (Figure 7). These changes were consistent with those reported with other integrin inhibitors including the antibody drug vedolizumab which is approved for the treatment of IBD. The full Phase 1 data set strongly supported the progression of MORF-057 into Phase 2 studies.
Figure 7: Lymphocyte subset populations were measured using multi-color flow cytometry. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. Median is of 5-6 individual data point per treatment and timepoints β7 high=expressing high levels of Integrin β7; β7+=expressing β7; P = placebo; M=MORF-057; D=day.
Phase 2
Our Phase 2 program for MORF-057 will be conducted in patients with IBD (beginning with UC) to assess clinical efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as RO as a pharmacodynamic marker of α4β7 inhibition, in addition to other translational biomarkers. This program is designed to consist of a Phase 2a trial and a Phase 2b trial that is planned to commence in the first quarter of 2022 with the Phase 2a trial. The Phase 2b trial is scheduled to commence later in 2022 following the Phase 2a.
The Phase 2a trial is designed as an open label study of 100 mg MORF-057 administered twice daily (BID) to approximately 30-35 patients with evaluations at timepoints including baseline, 12 weeks and upon the completion of treatment at 52 weeks. The measurements include safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (including α4β7 RO) and multiple clinical and histopathologic measures that comprise the Robarts Histopathologic Index and the clinical Adapted Mayo Score.
In the Phase 2b trial, we expect that patients will be treated with multiple doses of MORF-057 until a dose or doses (including a once-daily (QD) dose) are identified that confer significant levels of clinical response, while at the same time generating steady state RO levels consistent with those of vedolizumab. Once the doses that confer significant clinical benefit are identified, we expect that patients will be continued on treatment for at least 52 weeks. In the Phase 2b trial, assessments of disease activity are to be conducted at timepoints including baseline, as well as at 8 and 12 weeks (depending on the study) and upon the completion of approximately one year of treatment. They will include flexible sigmoidoscopy or complete colonoscopy with biopsies to assess colonic mucosal healing, fecal calprotectin, serum biomarkers and standardized scores of disease activity.
Additional Preclinical and Discovery Efforts
Next-generation α4β7 Integrin inhibitors for GI Diseases
Based on the well-understood biology of α4β7 inhibition and our progress with the MORF-057 program, Morphic has discovered and is advancing a family of next-generation α4β7 inhibitors through pre-clinical development with an initial therapeutic focus on potential development in GI indications beyond IBD, including eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), pouchitis and other indications.
αvβ8 Integrin inhibitor program for immuno-oncology
Integrin αvβ8 mediates cell type specific and tissue localized activation of TGF-β1/3. TGF-β is a key regulator of inflammation and immunity that plays a crucial role in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. In the tumor microenvironment (TME) TGF-β is upregulated, allowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance, impeding the immune system from mounting an anticancer response. TGF-β overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes and checkpoint resistance. In agreement, TGF-β inhibition was shown to enhance the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors by facilitating T cell anti-tumor immunity in animal models; Currently, multiple clinical trials by others that combine checkpoint inhibitor blockade and TGF-β inhibition are ongoing against various solid tumors. However, TGF-β plays important homeostatic roles across tissues and broad inhibitors of the pathway have encountered safety issues in the clinic.
αvβ8 has a well-described function in maintaining gut immune-homeostasis. αvβ8 integrin on dendritic cells (DC) and other immune cells activates TGF-β, induces tolerance and facilitates the generation of intestinal regulatory T cells (Treg). αvβ8 on Tregs is crucial for Treg-mediated suppression of inflammatory T cells. Moreover, αvβ8 regulates monocyte inflammatory responses and intestinal macrophage homeostasis. Overall, acting across different immune cell types, αvβ8 is crucial for the negative regulation of adaptive immunity, and promotion of immune homeostasis.
Based on described biology, αvβ8 has the potential to systemically regulate tolerance, including tumor immune tolerance. This program aims to deliver an oral small-molecule integrin modulator as an immuno-oncology therapy. The target is expressed in solid tumor and tumor stroma cells, including both immune and non-immune cells. The integrin modulator is expected to have several mechanisms of action, including inhibition of tumor intrinsic and extrinsic TGF-β resulting in increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes by effects including suppression of Treg, stimulation of antigen presentation by DC and reduced activity of cancer associated fibroblasts. For this program, chemical matter has advanced thanks to synergistic structure activity relationship, or SAR, screening with other integrin modulator programs. The crystal structure of the target integrin was elucidated for the first time in the field using our MInT Platform. Several of our compounds have been co-crystalized to fuel our understanding of the features driving compound selectivity and potency. Target validation and translational biology efforts are underway using small-molecule inhibitors.
Efficacy has been established in a number of syngeneic murine tumor models. For example, in an immune-excluded model of breast cancer (EMT6), a Morphic small molecule inhibitor reversed insensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB; Figure 8). Significant improvements in tumor burden and survival were accompanied by increased T cell infiltrates and evidence for reduced tumor tolerance. Inhibition of integrin αvβ8 in combination with low dose radiation induces antitumor effects in an advanced immune checkpoint blockade refractory tumor model (Figure 9). These results suggest that an orally administered αvβ8 targeted inhibitor has the potential to modulate anti-tumor immune response by acting across the immunologic synapse.
Figure 8: Efficacy in the EMT6 syngeneic murine model of breast cancer following dosing days 6 through 27 following tumor implantations. The panel on the left shows that the combination causes a greater reduction in tumor volume than vehicle or single agents. The panel on the right shows that animals treated with the combination survive longer than vehicle or single agents.
Figure 9: (1A) Effect of combination therapy with low dose radiation (small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) at 5 Gray (Gy) on the day of staging (day 10)), PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg twice weekly for 2 weeks) and αvβ8mAb (7 mg/kg three times weekly for 3 weeks) measured by tumor burden. 5Gy+PD-1 and 5Gy+αvβ8 has a minimal effect on tumor growth inhibition showing slight improvement relative to radiation alone (5Gy+IgG). Addition of αvβ8 antagonism (5Gy+αvβ8+PD-1) improves anti-tumor responses leading to CR in 8 of 10 mice. (1B) Kaplan-Meier Curve presenting time to progression. 5Gy+IgG improved survival over monotherapy with either αvβ8 or PD-1 mAb. 5Gy+αvβ8+PD-1 resulted in profound improvement of the survival over all other treatment conditions.
Integrin inhibitor program for pulmonary arterial hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, resulting in high pulmonary artery pressure and progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Current treatments, which target the prostacyclin, endothelin-1, or nitric oxide pathways, slow disease progression. However, the 5-year survival rate of approximately 60% highlights the need for therapies targeting alternative pulmonary vascular remodeling pathways. It is now recognized that, like cancer cells, pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) exhibit exaggerated proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in response to increased PA stiffness caused by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Integrins are known to promote cell proliferation, survival, hypertrophic growth and fibrosis, which are key elements in the progression of PAH, thus integrin expression and their effects on PA remodeling and RV failure was examined (Bonnet et. al. presented at AHA 2021, Circulation. 2021; 144:A10717).
Expression of fibronectin binding integrins is significantly increased in distal pulmonary arteries, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the right ventricle from PAH patients. In addition, increased expression was found in monocrotaline (MCT) and pulmonary artery banding (PAB) rats. Pharmacological inhibition of fibronectin binding integrin in vitro decreased PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferation and resistance to apoptosis which were associated with a decreased activation of integrin downstream signaling pathways. In cardiomyocytes and human right ventricular fibroblasts, inhibition of these integrins decreased hypertrophy and right ventricular fibroblasts activation and proliferation. Inhibition of fibronectin binding integrins improved vascular remodeling and right ventricular function in vivo as assessed by echocardiography and right heart catheterization in MCT rats with established PAH. Broad-spectrum integrin inhibition resulted in improvements in vascular remodeling and RV failure, suggesting that integrins play an important role in the pathophysiology of PAH (Figure 10). This understanding of fibronectin binding integrins is guiding Morphic in the identification of which integrins are important in PAH pathophysiology and translating those results into approaches for clinical development.
Figure 10: Pharmacological inhibition of fibronectin binding integrins with a broad-spectrum integrin small molecule inhibitor (SMi) with and without standard of care (SOC) reverses PAH in MCT-rat model with established PAH. The use of combination SOC and SMi preserves RV function.
Additional new integrin programs
Our strategy has enabled the identification of small molecules of multiple integrin targets that allow in-depth interrogations of these mechanisms. We are pursuing additional integrin modulator programs for fibrosis-related indications such as NASH, fibrostenosis, biliary fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Due to the role of integrins in TGF-β activation, mechano-transduction, cell migration and cell proliferation, integrins may trigger different pathways to initiate or exacerbate fibrosis under various pathophysiologic states and their inhibitors may be distinctly well suited for treatment in the context of different organ systems. These programs are at different discovery stages, with at least one of them expected to transition to lead optimization over the next twelve to eighteen months.
Integrin modulators targeting additional receptors
Our research collaboration with Janssen has strategically expanded the targets that our MInT Platform addresses, including αI integrins and modulators that are both inhibitors and activators. Several αI integrins play critical roles in immune cell tissue retention, regulation of collagen stiffness or cell attachment in extracellular matrix. Aberrant expression and function of these integrins have been implicated in a variety of diseases.
License Agreements
AbbVie Agreement
In October 2018, we entered into a research and development collaboration with AbbVie designed to advance a number of our oral integrin therapeutics for fibrosis-related indications.
Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie paid us an upfront payment of $100.0 million for research and development activities, and we provided AbbVie with exclusive license options on product candidates directed at a number of targets. For each compound related to this agreement, we conduct research and development activities through the completion of IND-enabling studies, at which point AbbVie may pay a license fee of $20.0 million, on a target-by-target basis, to exercise its exclusive license option and assume responsibility for global development and commercialization. The agreement also provides for clinical and commercial milestone payments to us and tiered royalties to us from high single digit to low teens on worldwide net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis for each licensed product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the royalty bearing patents covering such product in such country for so long as a generic product for such licensed product is not available in such country, (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (iii) the expiration of any other regulatory commercial exclusivity period in such country. In addition, for certain compounds for which we have completed IND-enabling studies and which meet certain advancement criteria for a liver fibrosis indication, the agreement permits us the option to commit to share development costs in exchange for an increased fixed royalty rate, which option we may exercise following completion of the first Phase 2b clinical trial for the relevant product candidate.
With respect to certain additional integrin targets, the agreement also grants AbbVie a fully paid up, irrevocable and one-time (with limited exceptions) right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize licensed compounds directed to such targets, and corresponding licensed products, in consideration for additional payments to be negotiated by the parties.
We and AbbVie have each agreed to certain exclusivity obligations under the agreement. In particular, we have agreed not to develop, either alone or with any third party, any product directed to a target for which we have granted AbbVie an exclusive option until the expiration of the agreement or, if AbbVie does not exercise an option, the end of the option period for such target.
AbbVie may terminate the agreement in its entirety, on a country-by-country basis, or on a target-by-target basis (for each target for which AbbVie has exercised an option), at any time and without cause, upon 180 days’ prior written notice to us. Additionally, AbbVie may terminate the agreement on a target-by-target basis (for each target for which AbbVie has exercised an option) immediately upon for any safety reason. Either party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or in the case of the other party’s insolvency.
In August 2020, pursuant to the agreement, AbbVie exercised its option to exclusively license and control further development and commercialization of our αvβ6–specific integrin program for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including IPF and additional fibrosis-related indications. In connection with the exercise of the option, AbbVie paid us $20.0 million. Under this license, AbbVie controls and is responsible for the development and commercialization of this program. AbbVie has informed us that it does not intend to advance any of our selective oral αvβ6-specific integrin inhibitors due to a suspected on-target/ αvβ6-mediated safety signal that has been observed in pre-clinical testing. Details about these observations are planned to be released in an upcoming scientific publication. As a result, we do not expect to receive additional payments for this program under the AbbVie Agreement.
Janssen Agreement
In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with Janssen, to discover and develop novel integrin therapeutics for patients with conditions not adequately addressed by current therapies. The Janssen collaboration focuses on three integrin targets, each target the subject of a research program, with the ability to substitute up to two integrin targets not explored by us.
Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, on a research program-by-research program basis, the companies will collaborate through preclinical development to identify and advance product candidates. Upon completing IND-enabling studies, on a research program-by-research program basis, Janssen may exercise an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license with respect to the target that is the subject of the research program, including all licensed compounds that are the subject of the applicable research program, and then Janssen will be responsible for global clinical development and commercialization. In consideration of the rights granted, Janssen paid us an upfront fee of $10.0 million for each of the first two research programs, and paid us an additional $5.0 million in January 2021 upon an amendment to the agreement to include activating antibodies in the third research program and commencement of that program. In addition, on a research program-by-research program basis, we may be eligible to receive up to an additional $10.0 million in payments for late lead candidate optimization activities and Janssen’s exercise of its exclusive option for such research program. In December 2021, Janssen informed us that they have 
decided not to exercise the options on the first two integrin targets. We are now eligible to receive up to $253.0 million in the aggregate from the collaboration in upfront, option and milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales. We will also receive, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, mid-single digit royalties (subject to royalty adjustments with aggregate floors) on worldwide net sales for any products resulting from the collaboration until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the royalty bearing patents covering such product in such country and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
If Janssen does not exercise an option for a research program, and we have completed a POC clinical trial for a product that was the subject of such research program, then Janssen will have an exclusive right of first negotiation to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Janssen would be granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize such product. In addition, if we have not completed a POC clinical trial for a product that was the subject of such research program and we make or receive a bona fide offer from a third party to license or transfer the rights to develop and commercialize such product, then under certain circumstances Janssen will have an exclusive first right to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Janssen would be granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize such product.
Under the Janssen Agreement, we have agreed to certain exclusivity obligations, including not to exploit, either alone or with a third party, any molecules that are intended to bind to any of the targets that are the subject of a research program, and also not to conduct clinical trials for, manufacture or commercialize compounds synthesized by us during our research activities in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury for three years after Janssen’s exercise of a first option. The Janssen Agreement will expire, on a research program-by-research program basis, upon (i) the expiration of the option period for such research program, if Janssen does not exercise its option for such research program, or (ii) the expiration all royalty terms for all products that are the subject of the research program, if Janssen does exercise its option for such research program. In addition, Janssen may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a research program-by-research program basis or country-by-country basis at any time and for any reason, upon 60 days’ advance written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement on program-by-research program basis for an uncured material breach by the other party or in the case of the other party’s insolvency.
Schrödinger Agreement
In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement (as amended) with Schrödinger, or Schrödinger Agreement, to explore drug targets selected by us. Under the collaboration, Schrödinger will use its technology platform to perform virtual screens, and we and Schrödinger will collaborate to facilitate prioritization of targets, perform target validation and analysis, identify leads and perform lead optimization. Under the terms of the agreement, Schrödinger will exclusively work with us on integrin targets during the term of the agreement. In consideration for its performance of activities under the collaboration, Schrödinger received approximately 3.4 million units of Series Seed preferred units. In addition, with respect to compounds identified as part of the collaboration, Schrödinger may be eligible to receive certain payments from us related to development milestones, not to exceed in the aggregate $3.1 million, on a target-by-target basis, a low six-figure payment upon initiation of lead optimization and on a compound-by-compound basis, as well as royalties in the low single digits on sales of products containing such compounds. In addition, we have agreed to pay Schrödinger a percentage, in the mid-single digits, of certain payments we receive from third parties in connection with the licensing or transfer of the rights to exploit such compounds to such third parties, and a one-time fee of $1.0 million paid in 2019. Schrödinger may terminate the Schrödinger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if a certain number of developmental milestones have not been achieved by us within a certain timeframe.
Children’s Medical Center Corporation Agreement
In October 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (as amended) with CMCC, or CMCC Agreement, relating to technology on inhibiting integrins developed by Dr. Springer during his employment at Boston Children’s Hospital, an affiliate of CMCC. Under this agreement, we have an exclusive license under certain patent rights, and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, owned by CMCC to develop and commercialize products worldwide for any therapeutic or diagnostic use in humans and veterinary applications. We also have the option to add new patent rights and know-how generated by the laboratory of Dr. Springer within a specified time after the effective date of the CMCC Agreement to that agreement for additional payments consistent with fair market value. In consideration of the license grants, upon execution of the CMCC Agreement we issued CMCC a number of shares of common stock representing 6% of the then issued and outstanding units on a fully diluted basis. We also paid CMCC an upfront license issue fee of $50,000, and reimbursed CMCC for certain patent prosecution costs. We have also agreed to pay CMCC a license maintenance fee for the first three years after the effective date 
of the CMCC Agreement, certain development milestones, a percentage of sublicensing income we may receive, and running royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products.
Under the CMCC Agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonably efforts to bring one or more licensed products to market, and to implement activities in a development plan within the timeframes set forth therein. In addition, if we fail to meet one or more specific developmental milestones, and do not take appropriate corrective action, then CMCC shall have the right to terminate the agreement.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect (i) our intellectual property related to our product candidates and related methods, and (ii) our MInT Platform for generating integrin structures and modulators of those structures. Our success also depends on having the freedom to operate to enable commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and preventing others from infringing our patent rights. We protect our MInT Platform using trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and, on rare occasion, patents. We protect our small molecule products using patents, and our policy is to seek product patent protection in key jurisdictions, including the United States, major European countries, and other jurisdictions we deem appropriate or as required by our collaboration agreements.
We file patent applications with respect to claims to compositions comprising our small-molecule inhibitors that modulate integrin activity, the compounds themselves, the use of such compounds to treat disease, as well as related manufacturing methods.
Patent Rights
We have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications from CMCC with claims relating to modified integrin polypeptides and modified integrin polypeptide dimers. The licensed U.S. patents and any other U.S. patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. In addition, we rely extensively on trade secret protection for our MInT Platform, which extends beyond the initial integrin technology licensed from CMCC.
As of December 31, 2021, we solely owned various issued patents and pending patent applications with respect to compositions of matter and methods of use for treating therapeutic indications related to the α4β7 integrins in the United States and many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, Japan and China. The expected expiration dates for the patents (or patent applications if granted) directed to our α4β7 program compounds are between 2039 and 2041 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. 
Intellectual Property Protection
We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Further, any issued patents may expire before the expected expiration dates disclosed above due to actions taken during patent prosecution, such as submission of a disclaimer surrendering the term of a patent beyond a certain date. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. While there are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the patent applications described above, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date or once any patent is granted.
The term of a patent depends upon the legal term of patents in the particular country in which it is obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits in some cases restoration of patent term as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In certain circumstances, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the unextended expiration date of the U.S. patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the approved drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the United States and the national patent offices in 
Europe, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates, and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, certain elements of our MInT Platform may be based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential, and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations and practices to protect our trade secrets.
Manufacturing
Currently, all of our clinical manufacturing facilities for clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing is outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs progress and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products. Under our collaboration agreements with AbbVie and Janssen, our partners will assume responsibility for the manufacturing according to the terms of those agreements for licensed products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our MInT Platform and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
Despite significant biopharmaceutical industry investment, no oral integrin therapies have been approved. We are developing MORF-057, an oral small molecule α4β7-specific integrin inhibitor, for the treatment of IBD. Currently approved IBD therapies include Entyvio (vedolizumab), an injectable α4β7 monoclonal antibody marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, as well as therapies with different mechanisms of action marketed by AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson, UCB, Biogen Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb, in addition to other pharmaceutical companies, against which our product candidate may compete, if approved. Further, we are aware of oral α4β7 therapies in clinical development for IBD by Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc, and EA Pharma Co. LTD, as well as therapies with different mechanisms of action in clinical development by AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in addition to other pharmaceutical companies.
Our αvβ8-specific small molecule integrin inhibitor program is under development for the treatment of solid tumors. There are currently no approved αvβ8 inhibitors. We are aware of anti-αvβ8 monoclonal antibodies in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors and other indications by Pfizer, Inc. and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we are aware of preclinical stage anti-αvβ8 monoclonal antibody programs from Venn Therapeutics and Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., and a small molecule program from Pliant Therapeutics. Furthermore, there are multiple antibody and small molecule therapeutics targeting the TGF-β pathway in development by Novartis International AG, AbbVie, Roche Holding AG, Merck & Co., Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Scholar Rock, in addition to other pharmaceutical companies.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, 
or necessary for, our programs. Additionally, our competitors may also include companies that are or will be developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that we are targeting, including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, and ethics committee for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled 
Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,875,000 for Fiscal Year 2021, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees, currently exceeding $336,000 for each prescription product for Fiscal Year 2021. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors of applications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months of the date of submission of the NDA to the FDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months of the date of submission of the NDA to the FDA. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, The FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition — generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA application user fee.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity — patent or nonpatent — for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been 
accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. The FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the exclusivity period.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-
Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA.
Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reports were due in 2014 and must be submitted on an annual basis. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, reporting on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required.
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new 
transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (now 70%) point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
There have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Reform Act, among other things, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices, and effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the suspension of the 2% Medicare sequester through March 31, 2021. Moreover, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and 
introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included at $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug process, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In particular, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The CMS also issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. It is unclear to what extent these new regulations will be implemented and to what extent these regulations or any future legislation or regulations by the Biden administration will have on our business, including our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law.
