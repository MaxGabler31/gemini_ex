Overview
iRobot Corporation ("iRobot" or the "Company" or "we") is a leading global consumer robot company that designs and builds robots that empower people to do more both inside and outside of the home. The Company's consumer robots help people find smarter ways to clean and accomplish more in their daily lives. iRobot's portfolio of solutions features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation, human-robot interaction, and physical solutions. For more than 25 years, we have been a pioneer in the robotics and consumer products industries. 
Since our founding in 1990, we have developed expertise in all the disciplines necessary to design and build durable, high-performance and cost-effective robots through the close integration of software, electronics and hardware. Our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to develop next-generation and new products, reducing the time, cost and risk of product development. Our significant expertise in robot design and engineering positions us to capitalize on the growth we expect in the market for robot-based consumer products.
Over the past sixteen years, we have sold more than 20 million consumer robots worldwide. During 2016, we took several steps to become more focused on our well-established consumer robots business and to capitalize on the substantial opportunities available to us within consumer markets. We completed the sale of our defense and security business unit in April 2016.  In addition, we reallocated all the research and development resources from our remote presence business to our consumer business during the first quarter of 2016, and exited the remote presence business during the second quarter of 2016. These actions were taken to solidify our position as the leader in diversified consumer robots and to focus on key technologies, with an emphasis on software, that allow our robots to understand the homes in which they operate. It is our intent to continue investing in these critical technologies and the economic opportunities they unlock.
During 2017, we continued to expand our global operations with the acquisition of two of our major distributors in Japan and Europe. On April 3, 2017, we closed the acquisition of the iRobot-related distribution business of Sales On Demand Corporation (SODC) based in Tokyo, Japan for approximately $16.6 million in cash. The acquisition of SODC will better enable us to maintain our leadership position and accelerate the growth of our business in Japan through direct control of pre- and post-sales market activities including sales, marketing, branding, channel relationships and customer service. It also expands our presence and customer outreach opportunities in Japan. Additionally, on October 2, 2017, we closed the acquisition of our largest European distributor, Robopolis SAS, a French company (Robopolis), for approximately $170.1 million in cash, which was offset by acquired cash held by Robopolis and its subsidiaries, resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately $132.1 million. We anticipate that this acquisition will enhance our distribution network, ensure global brand consistency and help us better serve the needs of European consumers. We expect to drive continued growth in global markets through a consistent approach to all market activities including sales, marketing, branding, channel relationships and customer service. Both acquisitions provide us with more direct control over the go-to-market execution in these key regions.
We also achieved a number of significant milestones in the past two years that we believe will assist us in continuing to generate profitable growth and enhance value for our shareholders. In particular, in 2016, we successfully launched Roomba 960, our second 900 series Roomba, that extends mapping, visual navigation and cloud connectivity to a wider range of customers. We also launched the Braava jet mopping robot, with precision jet spray and vibrating cleaning head, focused on expanding our wet floor care business. Both the Roomba 900 series and Braava jet are significantly more complex products, delivering enhanced performance enabled by software. The iRobot HOME App, compatible with both the Roomba 900 series and Braava jet, helps users get the most out of their experience by allowing them to choose the appropriate cleaning options for their unique home. We also announced a relationship with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that we believe will enable iRobot 
3

to address significant opportunities within our consumer business and the connected home. AWS Cloud is a managed cloud solution that enables connected devices to interact easily and securely with cloud applications and other devices. The AWS Cloud will enable iRobot to scale the number of connected robots it supports globally and allow for increased capabilities in the Smart Home. We implemented new Roomba marketing programs in the United States that resulted in a significant return on our investment which we plan to leverage as part of our strategy to accelerate growth in international markets. In 2017, we launched Roomba 690 and 890, extending Wi-Fi connectivity to the entire Roomba line. And, we launched several connected product features, including push notifications, Clean Map Reports and integrations with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and IFTTT platform technology.
Our total revenue for 2017 was $883.9 million, which represents a 33.8% increase from 2016 revenue of $660.6 million. Domestic consumer robots revenue grew $133.2 million primarily due to increased sales as a result of significant investments in advertising media and national promotions as well as the strength of the Roomba 900 series and Roomba 600 series. International consumer robots revenue grew by $94.6 million in 2017 with increases in most markets, offset by a decline in China.
Our financial performance in 2018 will be driven by our continued transformation to a global consumer robots company. Our strategy is to maintain Roomba’s leadership in the robotic vacuum cleaner segment while positioning the Company as a strategic player in the emerging Smart Home. We expect growth to be driven by:

• | deeper household penetration of Roomba globally;


• | continued investment in innovation to extend our technology and product leadership;


• | increased gross margin due to our acquisitions of two of our foreign distributors, SODC and Robopolis, in 2017;


• | adoption and awareness of Braava products through targeted marketing programs; and


• | research and development of new products.

Strategy
In 2002, iRobot created the home robot cleaning category with the introduction of its Roomba vacuuming robot. Today, we are a global enterprise that has sold more than 20 million consumer robots worldwide. iRobot’s success in driving adoption of connected Roomba robots has created a unique opportunity to extend consumer value in the home and expand our business. Our long-term strategy is to increase the penetration of our products in existing markets, expand current products into new markets, and develop and launch new products into current and adjacent markets. As our customer base grows, iRobot plans to create an ecosystem of connected robots designed to integrate with other devices. This ecosystem will create greater possibilities for new features and capacities as well as empowering the Smart Home.
Global expansion is a key component of our strategy. Our relentless pursuit of product leadership, through targeted investment in key technologies and capabilities, coupled with our investments in furthering our global brand and targeted marketing initiatives, allows us to continue to maintain our leadership position in the robotic vacuum cleaner segment despite increasing competition. Our recent acquisitions of distributors in Japan and Europe further this strategic objective.
To successfully execute our 2018 plan and drive revenue diversification and significant revenue growth beyond 2018, we plan to continue to make investments in our business during the year. These investments are expected to help iRobot achieve the following goals:

• | Continue to strengthen our marketing capabilities globally and accelerate worldwide consumer adoption of Roomba to maintain our market-leading position in robotic vacuum cleaners;


• | Continue to develop our wet floor care business to generate a material, secondary revenue stream;


• | Scale our infrastructure to support global operations and connected products;


• | Explore, develop and grow adjacent non-floor care consumer robot products that can generate meaningful diversified revenue streams; and


• | Make continued operational improvements that can reduce product and operating costs.

Key pillars of our strategy include:
Technology: As a leading global consumer robotics company, iRobot must develop and maintain best-in-class technology in the areas of cleaning, mapping and navigation. In 2018, iRobot plans to take steps towards expanding its product lines with new products that will deliver innovative solutions to improve cleaning performance, efficiency and ease-of-use. Mapping and navigation continues to be the core focus for iRobot. Consumer robots that can map and are spatially aware creates a unique and differentiating opportunity to expand consumer value.

Brand: In 2016, we rolled out a new logo, mark and brand language to signify the partnership between man and machine. In 2017, to meet our goal of a consistent brand experience in every region, we expanded our presence globally by taking more direct control of marketing programs and the customer experience in Japan and Europe by acquiring key regional distributors. We believe our expanded global presence will allow us to strengthen strategic retailer partnerships, minimize competitive pressures and increase our consumer activation field programs.
Portfolio: Our strategy includes building a portfolio of investments to diversify across markets and delivering a steady progression of innovation over time. In 2017, we introduced the Roomba 690 and 890, extending cloud connectivity to a wider range of consumers. We plan to continue to build a diverse portfolio of physical platforms and digital capabilities across international markets and deliver a steady progression of innovation and growth. To achieve this,we plan to focus on developing products with connectivity and mobile app-enabled features, including Wi-Fi home maps and advanced spatial intelligence and memory.
Talent: Our employees are the most important driver of who we are. Our success, diversity and reputation as developers of great talent make us an attractive employer to the top talent all over the world. Talent recruitment and retention continues to be at the core of what we accomplish as we map out our culture and work towards achieving our vision. We are also growing our company to meet organization needs by strategically investing in our employees around the globe.
Technology 
In 2016, iRobot narrowed its focus to the consumer market and made increased, but disciplined investments in advancing mapping and navigation, user interaction including cloud and app development and cleaning efficacy. From the launch of Braava jet, to the introduction of a lower cost Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or vSLAM, solution in Roomba 960, these strategic investments in technology had an immediate impact on product diversification, performance and market expansion. In 2017, we introduced two new connected products to the product portfolio bringing the advantages of cloud connectivity to more consumers. With the iRobot HOME App, we also delivered our robots’ maps directly to our customers through the launch of post-mission cleaning maps. We believe the improved performance of our connected robots, and the data sourced from our maps, will accelerate new product development and digital partnerships for the Smart Home.
We plan to continue to leverage opportunities, enabled by our growing connected product portfolio, to invest in developing technologies and interfaces for our products to provide a convenient and personalized user experience. At the foundation of our effort to drive enhanced user experience has been the deployment of our new connectivity and cloud infrastructure through AWS. We made this investment to enable us to scale our connected products globally, with increased access to valuable cloud services and applications to support future product features, and connect to other devices in the Smart Home.
From robotic vacuum cleaning to mopping, we are dedicated to developing market-leading solutions which provide compelling value to customers worldwide. From our customer’s perspective, the core value of our robots is the ability to efficiently and effectively perform a physical mission - the task for which that robot was initially purchased. In addition, we focus on features that allow the robots to perform longer, without consumer interaction. Our goal is to deliver maximum autonomy and effectiveness of the mission.
Products
Historically, we have designed and marketed robots for both the consumer and defense and security markets. Following completion of the divestiture of our defense and security business unit in April 2016, we are now focusing solely on the consumer market. With more than two decades of leadership in the robot industry, we remain committed to creating robots that empower people to do more.
Consumer Products
We sell various products that are designed for use in and around the home. Our current consumer products are focused on both indoor and outdoor cleaning applications. We believe our consumer products provide value to our customers by delivering a better way to clean and by freeing people from repetitive home cleaning tasks. To ensure the continued acceptance of our robots we will continue to invest in technology necessary to further improve their capabilities.
We currently offer multiple Roomba floor vacuuming robots at varying price points ranging from $299 to $899 based upon features and performance characteristics. Roomba's design allows it to clean under toe kicks, beds and other furniture, resulting in cleaner floors since the Roomba can access more of the floor than standard upright vacuum cleaners. In addition, Roomba eliminates the need to manually vacuum -- it cleans automatically upon the push of a button or through scheduling.
In 2017, we launched our newest connected robots, Roomba 690 and 890, bringing the advantages of connectivity to more consumers. Roomba 900 series robots help keep floors cleaner throughout the entire home with intelligent visual navigation, iRobot HOME App control with wireless connectivity, and 5x the suction power over previous generation Roomba vacuum cleaners. In addition to these highest-feature products, our lineup also includes the 800 series and 600 series robots. 
5

The Roomba 800 series robots offer our AEROForce technology which incorporates brushless, counter-rotating extractors that amplify suction for superior performance over bristle brushes, while requiring less maintenance than previous Roomba models. The Roomba 600 series robots offer a three-stage cleaning system which thoroughly vacuums every section of the floor multiple times, as well as AeroVac technology and improved brush design enabling the robot to better handle fibers like hair, pet fur, lint and carpet fuzz.
We currently offer the Braava family of automatic floor mopping robots designed exclusively for hard surface floors. These robots provide a different cleaning approach than our Roomba products. The Braava robots, priced at $199 and $299, automatically dust and damp mop hard surface floors using popular cleaning cloths or our specially designed reusable microfiber cloths, and include a special reservoir that dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle to keep the cloth damp. Braava jet, launched in March 2016, works with Braava jet Cleaning Pads to tackle a range of hard floor cleaning jobs, from wet mopping and damp sweeping to simple dusting. 
Our Mirra Pool Cleaning Robot is used to clean residential pools and removes debris as small as two microns from pool floors, walls and stairs. Mirra is brought to market under the iRobot brand through a relationship with Aquatron, Inc., which develops and manufactures the pool cleaning robots.
Defense and Security Products
As noted above, we completed the divestiture of our defense and security business unit in April 2016. Prior to this divestiture, we developed and delivered unmanned tactical ground robots in defense and security product markets. Following this divestiture, we no longer develop or sell defense and security products.
Strategic Alliances
In addition to our internal technology development, we leverage relevant robotic technologies through licensing, acquisitions and/or other partnerships. These strategic alliances are an important part of our product development and distribution strategies. We rely on strategic alliances to provide technology, complementary product offerings and increased and quicker access to markets. We seek to form relationships with organizations that can provide best-in-class technology or market advantages for establishing iRobot technology in new market segments.
Sales and Distribution Channels
We sell our consumer products through distributor and retail sales channels, as well as our on-line store. For the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and January 2, 2016, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 48.8%, 51.2%, and 56.0% of total revenue, respectively. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, the Company generated 13.5% of total revenue from one of its retailers (Amazon). For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated 12.9%, 12.3% and 10.4% of total revenue from its distributor in Japan, Sales On Demand Corporation (SODC), Robopolis SAS, a network of affiliated European distributors (Robopolis) and Amazon, respectively. For the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the Company generated 13.3% and 12.7% of total revenue from SODC and Robopolis, respectively. In April 2017, the Company acquired the iRobot-related distribution business of SODC, and in October 2017, the Company acquired Robopolis.
Consumer Products
Consumer product revenues were $883.7 million, $655.9 million and $559.6 million for fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the United States and Canada, we sell our consumer products primarily through a network of national retailers. Certain smaller domestic retail operations are supported by distributors to whom we sell our products directly. With the acquisition of SODC and Robopolis, iRobot now directly services retailers in Japan and countries that were previously serviced by Robopolis, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In support of sales in the United States, Canada, Japan and the seven European countries previously serviced by Robopolis, we maintain in-house sales, marketing and product management teams. In China, retailers are serviced by two local distributors. Due to the special needs of this market, we maintain a local sales, marketing and product team to support the distributors, manage the local marketing plan and meet product needs. Throughout the rest of the world, our products are sold primarily through a network of in-country distributors who resell to retail stores in their respective countries. These distributors are supported by our international sales and product marketing team.
Our retail and distributor networks are our primary distribution channels for our consumer products. We also offer products direct-to-consumer through our domestic and international on-line stores, representing 4.1%, 5.1% and 6.1% of total consumer robots revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have established valuable databases and customer lists that allow us to target directly those consumers most likely to purchase a new robot or upgrade. With Wi-Fi connectivity implemented across Roomba 690 and higher models, iRobot can more directly provide customer support via the iRobot HOME App. In addition, connectivity enables us to provide direct marketing material and push new features/fixes to robots in the field. We believe we maintain a close connection with our customers in each of our markets, which provides an enhanced position from which to improve our distribution and product offerings.

Customer Service and Support
We also provide ongoing customer service and support. Consumer customer service representatives, the majority of whom are employees of outsourced service organizations or our distribution partners, are extensively trained on the technical intricacies of our consumer products.
Marketing and Brand
We market our consumer robots to end-user customers through our sales and marketing teams as well as through our extensive network of retailers and in-country distributors. In addition, we sell directly to our consumers through our website. Our website is also playing an increasing role in supporting brand awareness, addressing customer questions and serving as a showcase for our products. 
Our marketing strategy is to increase our brand awareness and associate the iRobot brand with innovation, reliability and value. Our sales and marketing expenses represented 18.3%, 17.4% and 15.9% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in national advertising, consumer and industry trade shows, direct marketing and public relations to further build brand awareness.
We have built a trusted, recognized brand by providing high-quality robots. Customer word-of-mouth has been a significant driver of our brand's success to date. iRobot owner loyalty encourages repurchase, and positive customer experiences inspire others to adopt our products. Our marketing efforts are focused on fueling this word-of-mouth momentum, and we use public relations as well as various forms of advertising to promote our products.
In April 2017, we acquired SODC, launching four new iRobot offices in Japan. In October 2017, we acquired our largest European distributor, Robopolis, launching new iRobot offices in seven countries, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. These acquisitions allow us to drive continued growth in the region through a consistent approach to all market activities including sales, marketing, branding, channel relationships and customer service. Our innovative robots and public relations campaigns have generated extensive press coverage, and iRobot and our consumer robots have won several awards. Through these efforts, we have been able to build our brand, and we expect that our reputation for innovative products and customer support will continue to play a significant role in our growth and success.
Manufacturing
Our core competencies are the design, development and marketing of robots. Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource non-core competencies, such as the production of our robots, to third-party entities skilled in manufacturing. By relying on the outsourced manufacture of our robots, we can focus our engineering expertise on the design of robots.
Manufacturing a new product requires a close relationship between our product designers and the manufacturing organizations. Using multiple engineering techniques, our products are introduced to the selected production facility at an early-development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before tooling is finalized and mass production begins. As a result, we believe that we can significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and yields.
We outsource the manufacturing of our consumer products to four contract manufacturers, each of which manufactures our robots at a single plant in China. Our production processes give us the capacity to produce up to 20,000 robots a day, helping us to meet demand for peak seasons.
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop new products and product accessories, and enhancements to and applications for our existing products. For the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, our research and development expenses were $113.1 million, $79.8 million and $76.1 million, or 12.8%, 12.1% and 12.3% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs, and to enable us to introduce new products over the next few years that will continue to address our existing and adjacent market sectors.
Our research and development is conducted by teams dedicated to particular projects. Our research and development efforts are primarily located at our headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts and our office in Pasadena, California.
Competition
The market for robots is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the likely increased introduction of new products. A number of established companies have developed or are developing robots that will compete directly with our product offerings, and many of our competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess. Our competitors include consumer electronics companies such as Samsung, LG, Xiaomi and Shark, traditional floor cleaning brands with robotic offerings such as Dyson, Bissell and Hoover, as well as developers of robot floor cleaning products.
7

While we believe many of our customers purchase our Roomba floor vacuuming robots and Braava mopping robots as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, their traditional vacuum cleaners and wet floor cleaning methods, we do compete in some cases with providers of traditional cleaning products.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for robots include product features, performance for the intended mission, cost of purchase, total cost of system operation, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.
Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development and customer support. We cannot provide assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we provide products.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the intellectual skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of the sale of our defense and security business, we transferred to the buyer ownership of certain of our intellectual property related to the defense and security business, including patents, patent applications and trademarks.
As of December 30, 2017, we held 403 U.S. patents, more than 650 foreign patents, additional design registrations, and more than 450 patent applications pending worldwide. Our U.S. patents will begin to expire in 2019. We will continue to file and prosecute patent (or design registration, as applicable) applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents for our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. In that regard, we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances, and due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may not develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are patentable, or that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will harm or altogether preclude our ability to do business.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include iRobot and its stylized logo, Roomba, NorthStar, Create, iAdapt, Aware, Home Base, Looj, Braava, AeroForce, Mirra, vSLAM and Virtual Wall.  Our marks iRobot, Roomba, Braava, Virtual Wall, and certain other trademarks, have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to ours. Legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In 2017, we initiated a multi-party litigation at the U.S. International Trade Commission as well as in federal district court in Massachusetts based on claims of patent infringement. There is no guarantee that we will prevail on these or other patent infringement claims against third parties. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or the technology underlying our products is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. We have received in the past communications from third parties relating to technologies used in our various robot products that have alleged infringement of patents or violation of other intellectual property rights. In response to these communications, we have contacted these third parties to convey our good faith belief that we do not infringe the patents in question or otherwise violate those parties' rights. Although there have been no additional actions or communications with respect to these allegations, we cannot assure you that we will not receive further correspondence from these parties, or not be subject to additional allegations of infringement from others. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we attempt to design around the technology at issue or to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering applicable software or product solutions, our continued supply of software or product solutions could be disrupted or our introduction of new or enhanced software or products could be significantly delayed.

Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our second-half consumer product revenue represented 60.2%, 57.5% and 50.5% of our annual consumer product revenue, respectively. 
Regulations
Our business requires compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. In particular, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data.  In addition, the global nature of our business operations also creates various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subject us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, and our products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls.
We are also subject to international and U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, regulate energy efficiency and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
Prior to our divestiture of the defense and security business unit in April 2016, we were subject to various government regulations, including various U.S. federal government regulations as a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. federal government. We continue to remain subject to certain of these regulations only as they pertain to matters related to our operation of the defense and security business unit prior to our completion of the sale of this business.
Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we had 920 full-time employees. Approximately 31% of our employees are based outside of the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
