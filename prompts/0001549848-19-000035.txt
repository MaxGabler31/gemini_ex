ITEM 1. BUSINESS
References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Partnership," "we," "our," "us" or like terms when used in a historical context to reference operations or matters refer to Hi-Crush Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "our sponsor" refer to Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, our previous sponsor.
Overview
Hi-Crush Partners LP is a fully integrated, strategic provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American petroleum industry. We provide mine-to-wellsite logistics services that optimize proppant supply to customers in all major oil and gas basins in the United States, and own and operate multiple frac sand mining facilities and in-basin terminals. Our PropStream® service, offering both container- and silo-based wellsite delivery and storage systems, provides the highest level of flexibility, safety and efficiency in managing the full scope and value of the proppant supply chain. 
General
The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on May 8, 2012. In connection with its formation, the Partnership issued a non-economic general partner interest to Hi-Crush GP LLC, our general partner (the "general partner"), and a 100% limited partner interest to our sponsor, its organizational limited partner.
Corporate Conversion
The board of directors of the general partner unanimously approved a plan of conversion (the "Plan of Conversion") that provides and sets forth matters related to the conversion of the Partnership from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation named "Hi-Crush Inc." (the "Conversion"), which, subject to unitholder approval, will be completed through a series of transactions set forth in the Plan of Conversion. Pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, at the effective time of the Conversion, the outstanding common units will each be exchanged for one share of Hi-Crush Inc. common stock, par value $0.01 per share. Holders of common units will receive, in exchange for their common units, 100% of the common stock of Hi-Crush Inc. to be outstanding immediately following the Conversion. As a result of the Conversion, the Partnership will convert from an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes to an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Partnership filed a preliminary proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 5, 2019, which relates to a special meeting at which unitholders will be asked to consider any vote on proposals related to the Conversion. The special meeting of unitholders is expected to be held on April 11, 2019.
Acquisition of Hi-Crush Proppants LLC and Hi-Crush GP LLC
On October 21, 2018, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which the Partnership acquired all of the then outstanding membership interests in the sponsor and the non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership, in exchange for 11,000,000 newly issued common units (the "Sponsor Contribution"). In connection with the acquisition, all of the outstanding incentive distribution rights representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership were canceled and extinguished and the sponsor waived any and all rights to receive contingent consideration payments from the Partnership or our subsidiaries pursuant to certain previously entered into contribution agreements to which it was a party. 
Acquisition of FB Industries Inc.
On July 19, 2018, the Partnership entered into a purchase agreement to acquire FB industries Inc. ("FB Industries"), a company engaged in the engineering, design and marketing of silo-based frac sand management systems. Under the terms of the transaction, the Partnership paid cash consideration of $45.0 million and 1,279,328 newly issued common units to the sellers. The terms also include the potential for additional future consideration payments based on the achievement of established performance benchmarks through 2021. The Partnership completed this acquisition on August 1, 2018. 
Assets and Operations
According to John T. Boyd Company, a leading mining consulting firm focused on the mineral and natural gas industries ("John T. Boyd"), our proven reserves at our facilities consist of frac sand exceeding American Petroleum Institute ("API") specifications. Analysis of our sand at our facilities by independent third-party testing companies indicates that the sand demonstrates characteristics exceeding API specifications with regard to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), turbidity (low levels of contaminants), roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow or conductivity), acid solubility and percent quartz (mineralogy). 
Wyeville Facility
We own and operate a 971-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Wyeville, Wisconsin (the "Wyeville facility"), which, as of December 31, 2018, contained 72.1 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. The Wyeville facility, completed in 2011 and expanded in 2012, has an annual processing capacity of approximately 1,850,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Wyeville facility has an implied reserve life of 39 years as of December 31, 2018. In July 2018, the Partnership announced its plans to expand the production capacity at its Wyeville facility by an additional 850,000 tons per year. Following the expansion, the Wyeville facility’s annual processing capacity will increase to 2,700,000 tons of frac sand per year. The expansion at the Wyeville facility is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2019.
All of the product from the Wyeville facility is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet of track that connects our facility to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains. 
Augusta Facility
We own and operate a 1,187-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin (the "Augusta facility"), which, as of December 31, 2018, contained 42.1 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Construction of the Augusta facility was completed in June 2012 and we expanded the facility in 2014. The Augusta facility has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Augusta facility has an implied reserve life of 15 years as of December 31, 2018. The Augusta facility was temporarily idled in October 2015 until production resumed at reduced capacity levels in September 2016. The Augusta facility was again temporarily idled in January 2019. 
All of the product from the Augusta facility is shipped by rail from approximately 38,000 feet of track that connects our facility to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Blair Facility
We own and operate a 1,285-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Blair, Wisconsin (the "Blair facility"), which, as of December 31, 2018, contained 112.2 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Construction of the Blair facility was completed in March 2016. The Blair facility has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Blair facility has an implied reserve life of 39 years as of December 31, 2018. 
All of the product from the Blair facility is shipped by rail from approximately 45,000 feet of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railway mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Whitehall Facility
We own and operate a 1,626-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Independence, Wisconsin and Whitehall, Wisconsin (the "Whitehall facility"), which, as of December 31, 2018, contained 85.2 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. The Whitehall facility, completed in September 2014, has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, the Whitehall facility has an implied reserve life of 30 years as of December 31, 2018. The Whitehall facility was temporarily idled during the second quarter of 2016 and resumed production in March 2017. In September 2018, the Partnership temporarily idled dry plant operations at the Whitehall facility and resumed production in January 2019. 
All of the product from the Whitehall facility is shipped by rail from approximately 38,000 feet of track that connects the facility to a Canadian National Railway mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Kermit Facilities
In March 2017, we acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas, strategically positioned in the Permian Basin, within 75 miles of significant Delaware and Midland Basin activity. On July 31, 2017, we completed construction of our fifth on-site processing plant capable of producing 3,000,000 tons per year (the "Kermit facility") and commenced operations. 
In December 2018, we completed construction of a second production facility, located on our reserves near Kermit, Texas ("Kermit 2 facility"), adding 3,000,000 tons per year of processing capacity. The Kermit 2 facility is located west of the existing Kermit facility with separate road access to enable efficient entrance and egress. 
4

The Kermit facilities, as of December 31, 2018, contained 100.0 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, the Kermit facilities have an implied reserve life of 17 years as of December 31, 2018.
All of the product from our Kermit facilities is delivered by truck to the wellsite from 12 on-site silos with 36,000 tons of storage capacity.
Terminal Facilities
As of December 31, 2018, we own or operate 12 terminal locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Colorado and New York, of which three are idled and seven are capable of accommodating unit trains. Our terminals include approximately 114,000 tons of rail storage capacity and approximately 140,000 tons of silo storage capacity. Each terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays to facilitate efficient delivery of sand to the wellsite. Our terminals include rail-to-storage and rail-to-truck capabilities and serve as the majority of our terminal resources and materials management services. Our terminal facilities include origin and distribution material staging areas, rail track capabilities, material handling equipment, private rail fleet, bulk storage and quality assurance services.
Our terminals are strategically located to provide access to Class I railroads, which enables us to cost effectively ship product from our Wisconsin production facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we leased or owned 4,986 railcars used to transport sand from origin to destination and managed a fleet of approximately 2,169 additional railcars dedicated to our facilities by our customers or the Class I railroads. 
PropStream Operations 
In September 2016, the Partnership entered into an agreement to become a member of Proppant Express Investments, LLC ("PropX"), which was established to develop critical last mile logistics equipment for the proppant industry. In October 2016, the Partnership began providing to customers its PropStream integrated logistics service, utilizing containers.
On August 1, 2018, the Partnership completed the acquisition of FB Industries, a company engaged in the engineering, design and marketing of silo-based frac sand management systems.
Our PropStream last mile solution utilizes container and/or silo systems, and maintains strict proppant quality control from the mine to the blender, while also addressing environmental concerns through reduction of particulate matter emissions. We handle the full spectrum of logistics management with the industry’s only fully integrated solution, from railcar fleet management to truck dispatching and dedicated wellsite operations, which structurally reduces costs for customers by eliminating inefficiencies throughout the proppant delivery process. PropStream helps eliminate supply risk, provides increased transportation efficiency and reduces supply chain related congestion at the wellsite, decreasing the number of trucks required per job and decreasing or eliminating trucking demurrage costs. Our PropStream integrated logistics service is designed to meet or exceed the new respirable crystalline silica standards adopted under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSH Act") that became effective in June 2018 with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica that are set to become effective in June 2021 for hydraulic fracturing. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our Mine. Move. Manage. operational strategy and achieve our primary business objectives to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to unitholders over time because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Differentiated frac sand supply and logistics service. We provide integrated, mine-to-wellsite frac sand supply and logistics services to customers with an emphasis on safety, surety and efficiency. By controlling all points along the supply chain, we are able to better control quality and consistency of product, reduce delivery costs to our customers, and realize supply chain efficiencies, resulting in more efficient and productive wellsite operations for our customers. Our offerings are unique in their ability to provide customers with wellsite-specific solutions for proppant supply, delivery and management due to our control of Wisconsin and West Texas production facilities, multiple in-basin rail terminals, and both container and silo-based last mile and wellsite management solutions. This enables us to completely replace customers’ fragmented sand supply chains with a simplified infrastructure for purchasing and administration utilizing constantly adapting technologies and best practices, including jobsite and operational safety. 


• | Long-term customer relationships. In conjunction with, and fully-supportive of, our integrated and differentiated frac sand and logistics service offering, we have developed and continue to expand our relationships with customers, particularly exploration and production companies ("E&Ps"). During the fourth quarter of 2018, 51% of our total sales volumes were to E&Ps, compared to having no sales direct to E&Ps at the start of 2017. These E&P relationships are built and strengthened through realization of mutual benefits that accrue to both us and our customers. These include more integrated near- and long-term supply/demand planning, lower volatility in sand and services demand, better visibility for us and our customers, surety of supply for our customers, surety of demand for our products and services, and greater emphasis on long-term cost savings versus near-term price fluctuations. These relationships are also supported by long-term contractual agreements. As of January 1, 2019, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 2.3 years. Our contracts define, among other commitments, the volume of product that the Partnership must provide and the volume that the customer must purchase by the end of the defined periods. Pricing structures under our agreements are in many cases subject to certain contractual adjustments and consist of a combination of negotiated pricing and fixed pricing. A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in master services agreements ("MSA") and related work orders. The MSA and related work orders are typically separate from any sand supply contract we may have with the same customer. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand and services to our customers with long-term contracts in 2019 and future years. We believe the fully integrated service model combining sand and last mile logistics creates lasting relationships with our customers who value reliability of supply and cost effective delivery to the wellsite. 


• | Competitive operating cost structure. Our plant operations have been strategically designed to provide low per-unit production costs. At our Kermit facilities, our production costs benefit from a reserve base that is easily accessible with limited to no overburden and no royalty. Our Kermit facilities, located in the heart of the Permian Basin, are capable of loading produced frac sand directly into the truck and are logistically advantaged with proximity to significant frac sand demand and wellsite locations. At our Wisconsin facilities, we benefit from shallow overburden, which provides for a lower cost structure than mining operations of reserves with deeper or more complex overburden. We also benefit by having purpose-built facilities with similar designs, allowing for economics of scale in purchasing and labor flexibility. Our mining operations are subcontracted to a third-party excavation company at a fixed cost per ton excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge. The strategic location and logistics capabilities of our portfolio of production facilities enables us to serve all major U.S. and Canadian oil and natural gas producing basins. Unlike many competitors, our processing and rail loading facilities are located on-site, which eliminates the requirement for on-road transportation, lowers product movement costs, minimizes degradation of sand quality due to handling at the origin and lowers environmental impact. Owning and operating our terminal network provides for reduced operating and freight costs, while also ensuring our customers receive priority scheduling, expedited delivery and a more cost-effective delivery alternative. Our fully integrated PropStream last mile solution utilizes purpose built equipment, minimizing operating costs as the wellsite. 


• | Strategically located terminal facilities. We deliver our frac sand through an extensive logistics network of owned and operated rail-based terminals strategically located throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Colorado and New York to serve our customers' operations in North America's shale and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays. Additionally, we have access to facilities owned and operated by third parties to further increase the reach of our logistics footprint and number of origin and destination pairings. Our distribution network allows us to better, and cost effectively, service our customers’ short-notice needs across basins, and provide our customers with reliable supply and solutions for the logistical challenges presented by the large volume of frac sand typically required for each well completion. 


• | Experienced and incentivized management team. Our management team has extensive experience operating in the oil and natural gas industry, long-term relationships with participants in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries, a strong operational and commercial understanding of the markets in which our customers operate, and expertise in development, construction and operation of frac sand processing and terminal facilities, bulk solids material handling, frac sand supply chain management, and rail and truck logistics. Our management team is focused on optimizing our current business and expanding our operations through disciplined execution of our Mine. Move. Manage. operational strategy. Our management team is well-aligned with the interests of common unitholders through their combined 5% direct ownership interest in our limited partnership units, whose value are directly impacted by prudent growth in profitability, cash flows and the overall success of the business. 

Business Strategies 
Our primary business objectives are to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to unitholders over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

• | Providing sand as a service. As we meet our customers' varied and evolving needs, we focus on the management of frac sand for our customers through "sand as a service." Through the development and deployment of PropStream, our fully integrated last mile solution for delivery of sand using both containers and silo systems, we leverage our capabilities to manage our customers' frac sand and logistics needs all the way from the mine to the blender at the wellsite. Our relentless focus on execution of our operations aligns our service with their needs for quality and reliability as we handle the frac sand production, transportation and management challenges faced every day, while also placing a priority on safety. 


• | Focusing on long-term relationships with key customers. A key component of our business model is our integrated service model of providing sand and last mile services directly to the end user, particularly the larger E&Ps. Another component has been our sales strategy, which seeks to secure a high percentage of our volumes under long-term contracts with oil and natural gas E&Ps and major pressure pumping service providers. As of January 1, 2019, more than 60% of our currently operating production capacity is under long-term contracts with E&Ps and during the fourth quarter of 2018, 51% of our total sales volumes were to E&Ps. We believe this provides a more stable base of cash flow, while also providing the flexibility we and our customers desire in the event of market changes. We believe this business model serves as the foundation for our ability to serve our customers, while reliably providing the product that is a critical component to the well completion process. We intend to utilize a substantial majority of our processing capacity to fulfill our customer contracts and continue to serve our existing and new customers with frac sand delivered through our distribution network and to the blender at the wellsite. We also intend to expand our PropStream services provided to our long-term relationships to further optimize their sand supply chain and reduce their cost of well completions. 


• | Capitalizing on compelling industry fundamentals. We intend to continue positioning ourselves as a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry, as we believe the proppant and logistics market offers attractive growth fundamentals over the long-term. The innovations in horizontal drilling in the various North American shale basins and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays have resulted in greater demand for frac sand per well and per stage. The long-term growth in frac sand demand and related logistics services is underpinned by continued horizontal drilling, increasing frac sand use per well and cost advantages over other proppant types, including resin-coated sand and ceramics. 


• | Building on our position as a low cost provider. We seek to maintain and improve upon our position as a low cost provider of frac sand. We will continue to analyze and pursue organic expansion efforts that will similarly allow us to capitalize on and cost-effectively optimize our existing production and logistics assets. For example, in 2018 we developed the second Kermit facility and began expansion of the Wyeville facility supported by a sand supply agreement with a major operator in the Permian. In addition, we seek to identify and evaluate additional terminal site locations to expand our geographic footprint allowing us to enhance our distribution network and ensure that our frac sand production is available to meet the evolving and dynamic in-basin needs of our customers. Further, we seek to find ways to reduce our customers' cost of frac sand delivered to the blender at the wellsite regardless of the source of production. We intend to accomplish this through a combination of our low cost production, our network of owned and operated terminals or third-party operated sites, our geographic footprint, and our PropStream integrated logistics service. We intend to continue to analyze and pursue opportunities to cost-effectively expand our geographic reach, optimize our existing assets and meet our customers' demand for our high quality frac sand. 


• | Pursuing accretive acquisitions. In June 2013, we acquired D&I Silica, LLC ("D&I"), the owner of the largest distribution network in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. The foundation of this acquisition enabled us to operate through an extensive logistics network of rail-based terminals, which today, has been expanded and is strategically located throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Colorado and New York. In separate transactions between 2013 and 2017, we acquired all of the equity interests in the Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities previously owned by our sponsor. In March 2017, we acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas from Permian Basin Sand Company, LLC. In August 2018, we acquired FB Industries, a company engaged in the engineering, design and marketing of silo-based frac sand management systems. We expect to continue pursuing accretive acquisitions of third-party frac sand assets, including production facilities and/or distribution and logistics operations. As we evaluate acquisition opportunities, we intend to remain focused on operations that complement our reserves of premium frac sand, our portfolio of efficient production facilities, and assets that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. We believe these factors are critical to our business model and are important characteristics for any potential acquisitions. 


• | Maintaining financial flexibility and ample liquidity. We continue to pursue a disciplined financial policy and maintain liquidity aligned with our future financing needs and debt maturities. As of February 14, 2019, we had cash of $61.5 million and our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility") had $58.7 million pursuant to available borrowings ($79.8 million, net of $21.1 million letter of credit commitments), resulting in total liquidity of $120.2 million. The ABL Credit Facility is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including the making of certain restricted payments permitted therein. Borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. On August 1, 2018, the Partnership completed the private placement of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.50% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes"). In January 2017, we entered into an equity distribution program under which we may sell through or to certain financial institutions up to $50.0 million in common units. In addition, in 2016 and 2017, we completed four public offerings of a total of 43,125,000 common units for aggregate net proceeds of $601.6 million. We believe that our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provides us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic expansion and acquisition strategy. 


• | Corporate Conversion. The board of directors of the general partner unanimously approved the Plan of Conversion. The Partnership filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC on February 5, 2019. The proxy statement relates to a special meeting of unitholders that is expected to be held on April 11, 2019 and at which unitholders will be asked to consider and vote upon proposals relating to the Conversion, which, subject to unitholder approval, will be completed through a series of transactions set forth in the Plan of Conversion. As a result of the Conversion, the Partnership will convert from an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes to an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe the Conversion is critical to the future success of the Partnership. With the reduction in the number of master limited partnerships generally and the increased focus of the Partnership’s business on logistics, we believe that accomplishing our growth plans and executing on our strategy for long-term success are best achieved through a traditional corporate structure. We also believe that the transition to a C-Corporation will streamline corporate governance benefiting shareholders with enhanced protections and rights. In addition, we believe the Conversion will increase our access to, and lower the cost of, capital by increasing trading liquidity and making us more accessible to a broader investor base. Subject to receipt of unitholder approval, the Partnership currently expects to complete the Conversion shortly following conclusion of the special meeting. Upon completion of the Conversion, we expect to be renamed "Hi-Crush Inc." and our common stock will be listed for trade on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "HCR." 

Our Industry 
The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the mining, manufacturing and delivery of the propping agents used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method for stimulating increased production from wells. The process consists of pumping fluids, mixed with granular proppants, into the geologic formation at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock. Proppant-filled fractures create conductive channels through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.
Industry Data
The market and industry data included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K was obtained through our own internal analysis and research, coupled with industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis conducted by third parties. Industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Although we believe that the industry reports are generally reliable, we have not independently verified the industry data from third-party sources. Although we believe our internal analysis and research is reliable and appropriate, such internal analysis and research has not been verified by any independent source.
Types of Proppant
There are three primary types of proppant that are commonly utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads. We are engaged exclusively in the production of raw frac sand.
Raw Frac Sand
Of the three primary types of proppant, raw frac sand is the most widely used due to its broad applicability in oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative to other proppants. Raw frac sand has been employed in nearly all major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins.
Raw frac sand is generally mined from the surface or underground, and in some cases crushed, and then cleaned, dried and sorted into consistent mesh sizes. The API has a range of guidelines it uses to evaluate frac sand grades and mesh sizes. In order to meet API specifications, frac sand must meet certain thresholds related to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow, or conductivity), particle size distribution, turbidity (low levels of contaminants), acid solubility and percent quartz (mineralogy). Oil and natural gas producers generally require that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Raw frac sand can be further delineated into three main types: Northern White, Brady Brown and what is commonly referred to as "In-Basin" frac sand. The term "Northern White" is a commonly-used designation for premium white sand produced in Wisconsin and other limited parts of the upper Midwest region of the United States. Northern White, which is the type of frac sand we produce at our Wisconsin facilities, is known for its high crush strength, low turbidity, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Northern White frac sand has historically commanded premium prices relative to Brady Brown. Brady Brown, or regional sand, had been preferred due to its proximity the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale plays, and, therefore, its lower cost due to reduced logistics costs compared to Northern White frac sand. In-Basin frac sand began to be developed and produced in 2017 in the Permian Basin and is also being developed and produced in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Mid-Con basins and has been adopted quickly due to its proximity to wellsites and reduced logistics costs. We produce Northern White and In-Basin frac sand at our production facilities. 
Resin-Coated Frac Sand
Resin-coated frac sand consists of raw frac sand that is coated with a flexible resin that increases the sand’s crush strength and prevents crushed sand from dispersing throughout the fracture. Precured (or tempered) resin-coated sand primarily enhances crush strength, thermal stability and chemical resistance, allowing the sand to perform under harsh downhole conditions. Curable (or bonding) resin-coated frac sand uses a resin that is designed to bond together under closure stress and high temperatures, preventing proppant flowback. We do not produce resin-coated frac sand, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload resin-coated frac sand for use by our customers. 
Ceramics
Ceramic proppant is a manufactured product of comparatively consistent size and spherical shape that typically offers the highest crush strength relative to other types of proppants. Ceramic proppant derives its product strength from the molecular structure of its underlying raw material and is designed to withstand extreme heat, depth and pressure environments. We do not produce ceramic proppant, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload ceramic proppant for use by our customers. 
Proppant Mesh Sizes
Mesh size is used to describe the size of the proppant and is determined by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired size of the proppant. Each type of proppant comes in various sizes, categorized as mesh sizes, and the various mesh sizes are used in different applications in the oil and natural gas industry. The mesh number system is a measure of the number of equally sized openings per square inch of screen through which the proppant is sieved. For example, a 40 mesh screen has 40 equally sized openings per linear inch. Therefore, as the mesh number increases, the granule size decreases. In order to meet API specifications, 90% of the proppant described as 40/70 mesh size proppant must consist of granules that will pass through a 40 mesh screen but not through a 70 mesh screen. We excavate various mesh sizes at our facilities, and sell 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh frac sand used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Demand Trends
Demand for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity. We believe that demand for proppant will grow over the long-term as a result of the following demand drivers:

• | improvements in drilling rig productivity (from, among other things, pad drilling), resulting in more wells drilled per horizontal rig per year;


• | increases in the number of wells drilled per acre;


• | increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the number of fracture stages per lateral foot in the typical completed horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the volume of proppant used per fracturing stage; and


• | recurring efforts to offset steep production declines in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs, including the drilling of new wells and secondary hydraulic fracturing of existing wells.

Demand fundamentals are expected to improve in 2019 compared to the latter part of 2018, particularly as some of the factors limiting demand in the back half of 2018, including E&P budget exhaustion and pipeline take-away constraints, are alleviated. 
Additionally, an increase in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells represents pent up demand for completion services and frac sand that will provide further support for overall demand in 2019 and beyond, regardless of rig count activity.
Demand for logistics services associated with frac sand has been directly correlated with the demand for frac sand, and is expected to grow in the second half of 2019 supported by the frac sand demand fundamentals.
Supply Trends
In response to growing demand for U.S. frac sand, the industry has developed additional capacity, with the majority of this development in the Permian Basin. In 2017, several new and existing suppliers announced planned capacity additions of frac sand supply. With the completion of construction and start-up of operations at several Permian Basin mines during 2018 as well as mines in the Eagle Ford and other basins, In-Basin supply is becoming more available. Frac sand supply currently exceeds demand, however, we believe the supply and demand will be in balance over time as demand continues to grow over the coming years. While stated frac sand capacity may exceed near-term demand, available industry capacity is constrained due to several factors, including availability of the grades of frac sand that are most in demand in certain regions or well completion environments, general operating conditions and normal downtime, and logistics constraints.
The advent of In-Basin sand supply available closer to the wellsite in the Permian Basin, and to a lesser extent in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Mid-Con basins, has resulted in a rapid shift in supply from Northern White sand to In-Basin sand supply. However, we believe this shift is specific to finer mesh sizes of sand, particularly 100 mesh which is the principal grade produced in-basin. Northern White supply of 100 mesh is likely to shift to meet the demand for sand in other basins, with other mesh sizes of Northern White continuing to find a market in the Permian Basin. While these shifts may cause periodic mismatches of supply and demand in particular basins, we do not believe there will be a long-term oversupply of sand given the projections of increasing demand.
The onset of reduced completion activity beginning in the third quarter of 2018 has caused frac sand demand growth to lag the increase in supply, and has resulted in a significant reduction in pricing, particularly for Northern White sand, that is impacting sand pricing in all basins. These factors have resulted in declines in pricing of 10 percent or more in the latter part of 2018. In response to the price decline, we and many of our competitors have reduced available capacity through the temporary idling of facilities. In September 2018, the Partnership temporarily idled dry plant operations at the Whitehall facility and resumed production in January 2019. Our Augusta facility was temporarily idled in January 2019.
We believe there will be continued demand for Northern White frac sand within the Permian Basin as completions activity within that basin increases due to customer preferences and other factors. However, we believe a large portion of Northern White frac sand which previously supplied the Permian Basin was displaced in 2018 due to continued adoption of locally-produced sand. These Northern White volumes are being reallocated into other major oil and natural gas basins around the country where they are most cost-effectively delivered via rail, barge or other modes of transportation, and which do not have the same readily available production of In-Basin sand. However, over time we believe frac sand facilities producing Northern White at a higher cost are likely to be idled or permanently shut down due to increased competition within these regions resulting in realized sales pricing below the level at which such facilities can profitably operate. At this time it is not possible to determine which facilities will be idled or shut down, or the exact timeframe in which such actions would be taken.
There are several potential geological, operational and economic constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis, including:

• | the difficulty of finding frac sand reserves that meet API specifications and consisting of the mesh size in demand;


• | the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to develop a processing facility with a higher base of fixed costs;


• | the challenges of identifying frac sand reserves with the above characteristics that either are located in close proximity to oil and natural gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;


• | the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities;


• | local opposition to development of facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road transportation, including hours of operations and noise level restrictions, in addition to moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in some jurisdictions in Wisconsin and other states which hold potential sand reserves; and


• | the typically long lead time required to design and construct sand processing facilities that can efficiently process large quantities of high quality frac sand.

Logistics services are provided in various combinations of service components including railcar fleet management, truck dispatching and dedicated wellsite operation.  Supply of last mile logistics services broadly fall in the categories of transitional pneumatic trucking operations, container solutions and silo systems.  There are a number of small and large competitors in the three broad categories with new technologies being developed and tested.  We believe a differentiating factor among the various competitors will be the reliability of the service and the execution on a day-to-day basis and, over time, we expect consolidation of the service offerings in the industry.
Pricing
Given the expectation for increased oil and natural gas exploration and production activity in North America, coupled with the increased proppant demand per well, and the increases in sand supply noted above, frac sand pricing has been volatile, rising from the latter half of 2016 through the first half of 2018. During the latter half of 2018, frac sand pricing reversed trend and rapidly declined due to the combined impact of increasing supplies of In-Basin sand and reduced completions activity. We believe pricing could improve during 2019 as new supply is expected to be absorbed by the potential increase in demand as disadvantaged supply is idled.
There are numerous grades and sizes of proppant which sell at various prices, dependent primarily upon the delivery point, and also quality, grade of proppant, deliverability and many other factors.  Pricing of proppant sold at the terminal is higher than pricing of proppant sold FOB plant as a result of the associated transportation and handling costs to bring the sand from the mine to the terminal. No reliable publicized pricing information for raw sand exists. However, it is believed that the overall pricing trends tend to be consistent across the various sizes and within regions with some variation due to transportation costs, resulting from distance from the source. We believe a significant amount of proppant is sold under long-term contracts with varying pricing mechanisms, with the remainder being sold under short-term pricing arrangements.
Pricing for logistics services is generally based on a fixed component for labor and equipment and a variable component based on transportation costs.  Pricing for logistics services has been less volatile than frac sand pricing over the past few years, but is becoming more competitive given the increasing number of companies and technologies offering certain services or combinations thereof.  
Customers and Contracts
Our current customer base includes major oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and pressure pumping service providers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Chevron USA Inc. ("Chevron") and Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") each accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to each of Halliburton and Liberty Oilfield Services ("Liberty") accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to each of Halliburton, Liberty, US Well Services, LLC and Weatherford International Ltd. accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. 
A substantial portion of our frac sand is sold to customers with whom we have long-term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 87% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand to our customers with long-term contracts in 2019 and future years. As of January 1, 2019, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 2.3 years with remaining terms ranging from 15 to 72 months. 
Our contracts define, among other commitments, the volume of product that the Partnership must provide and the volume that the customer must purchase by the end of the defined periods. Pricing structures under our agreements are in many cases subject to certain contractual adjustments and consist of a combination of negotiated pricing and fixed pricing. These arrangements may undergo negotiations regarding pricing and volume requirements, which may occur in volatile market conditions. We also sell sand on the spot market, at prices and other terms determined by the existing market conditions as well as the specific requirements of the customer. 
A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in master services agreements ("MSA") and related work orders.  The MSA typically outlines the general terms and conditions for work performed by us relating to invoicing, insurance, indemnity, taxes and similar terms.  The work orders typically define the commercial terms including the type of equipment and services to be provided, with pricing that is generally determined on a job-by-job basis due the variability in the specific requirements of each wellsite.  The MSA and related work orders are typically separate from any sand supply contract we may have with the same customer. 
We may, from time to time, sell silo systems and related equipment to third parties at negotiated prices for the specific equipment.
Suppliers 
Although the majority of the frac sand that we sell is produced from our production facilities, we can purchase, and have purchased in the past, a certain amount of frac sand and other proppant from various third parties for sale to our customers. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Partnership purchased 267,628 and 142,019 tons, respectively, from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership did not purchase any sand from third parties.  
Our Operations 
Frac Sand Excavation Operations
Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic setting, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods. The composition, depth and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to produce sand grains required to meet API specifications. In contrast, unconsolidated deposits (loosely bound sediments of sand), like those found at our Wyeville facility, may require little or no crushing during the excavation process. 
The surface excavation operations at our production facilities are conducted by a third-party contractor. The mining technique at our production facilities is open-pit excavation of approximately 20-acre panels of unconsolidated silica deposits. At our Kermit facilities, unconsolidated dune sand is mined through the excavation process. At our Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities, the excavation process involves clearing vegetation and trees overlying the proposed mining area. Additionally, limited blasting procedures are conducted at our Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities. The initial two to five feet of overburden is removed and utilized to construct perimeter berms around the pit and property boundary. No underground mines are operated at our production facilities.
A track excavator and articulated trucks are utilized for excavating the sand at several different elevation levels of the active pit. The pit is dry mined, and if necessary, the water elevation is maintained below working level through a dewatering and pumping process. The mined material is loaded and hauled from different areas of the pit and different elevations within the pit to the primary loading facility at our mines' on-site wet processing facilities. We pay a fixed fee per ton of sand excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge.
At our Wyeville facility, in addition to surface excavation, sand is also mined through dredging operations.  Silica deposits are extracted from the ground with water.  The resulting slurry is transported via pipeline to the wet processing facility. Similar to surface excavation operations, the dredging at our Wyeville facility is performed by a third-party contractor.
Processing Facilities 
Our processing facilities are designed to wash, sort, dry and store our raw frac sand, with each plant employing modern and efficient wet and dry processing technology.
Our mined raw frac sand is initially stockpiled before processing. The material is recovered by a mounted belt feeder, which extends beneath a surge pile and is fed onto a conveyor. The sand exits the tunnel on the conveyor belt and is fed into the wet plant where impurities, such as clay and organic particles, and unusable fine grain sand are removed from the raw feed. The wet processed sand is then stockpiled in advance of being fed into the dry plant for further processing. The Wisconsin wet plants operate for seven to eight months per year due to the limitations arising from sustained freezing temperatures during winter months. When in operation, our Wisconsin wet plants process more sand per day than the dry plants can process to build up stockpiles of frac sand that will be processed by the dry plants during the winter months. The Kermit wet plants operate year round and therefore the stockpiles of frac sand are processed by the dry plants in a shorter timeframe.
The wet processed sand stockpile is fed into the dry plant hopper using a front end loader. The material is processed in a natural gas fired vibratory fluid bed dryer contained in an enclosed building. After drying, the sand is screened through gyratory screens and separated into industry standard product sizes. The finished product is then conveyed to multiple on-site storage silos for each size specification and our railcar loads are tested to ensure that the delivery meets API specifications. Oil and natural gas producers increasingly require current testing and proof that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Logistics Capabilities 
Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to terminal facilities, or directly to the customers by truck, rail or barge. For bulk raw frac sand, transportation costs often represent a significant portion of the customer’s overall product cost. Consequently, shipping in large quantities, particularly by unit train when shipping over long distances, provides a significant cost advantage to the customer, emphasizing the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery. As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are among the most important considerations for producers, distributors and customers.
All of the product sold from our Wyeville and Augusta facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet and 38,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facilities to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. All of the product sold from our Blair and Whitehall facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 45,000 feet and 38,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railway mainline. These rail spurs, size of the rail yards and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. All of the product sold from our Kermit facilities is delivered by truck to the wellsite from  on-site silos with 36,000 tons of storage capacity.

Terminal Operations
We generally operate our terminal locations under long-term lease agreements with third-party operators or short-line rail companies. Some of these lease agreements include performance requirements, which typically specify a minimum number of rail cars that must be processed by us each year through the terminal. Each owned or operated terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays so that our customers typically do not need to travel more than 75 miles from the wellsite to purchase their frac sand requirements. Our terminals include rail-to-truck and, at silo storage locations, rail-to-storage capabilities.
Once the frac sand is loaded into rail cars at the origin, we utilize an extensive network through a combination of Class I and short-line railroads to move the sand to our terminals. For our terminals with silo storage capabilities, frac sand is loaded into delivery trucks directly from our silos. Our silos deploy sand via gravity to trucks stationed directly on scales under each silo with the loading, electronic recording of weight and dispatch of the truck capable of being completed in less than five minutes. Silos are considerably more efficient than conveyors, which require trucks to be loaded and then moved to separate scales to be weighed; however, frac sand can also be unloaded to delivery trucks directly via a conveyor. 
PropStream Operations
Our PropStream last mile solution maintains strict proppant quality control from the mine to the blender, while also addressing environmental concerns through reduction of particulate matter emissions. We handle the full spectrum of logistics management, from railcar fleet management to truck dispatching and dedicated wellsite operation, structurally reducing costs for customers by eliminating inefficiencies throughout the proppant delivery process. PropStream provides increased transportation efficiency and reduces supply chain related congestion at the wellsite, decreasing the number of trucks required per job and decreasing or eliminating trucking demurrage costs. Our PropStream integrated logistics service is designed to meet or exceed the new OSH Act respirable crystalline silica standards with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations set to become effective in 2021 for hydraulic fracturing. PropStream helps eliminate supply risk and improve efficiency with the industry’s only fully integrated solution offering both container and silo systems.
Containers: Our PropStream container service involves loading proppant into containers before being transported by truck to the wellsite. The 8-foot cubic, purpose-built containers each transport up to 33,000 pounds of proppant and, depending on Department of Transportation and local regulations, allow for the transport of up to 55,000 pounds per truck.  The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely used pneumatic equipment. Each truck delivers up to 25 tons of proppant in two easily handled, small-footprint containers. Our PropStream container service also provides flexible and scalable storage at the wellsite compared to silo solutions and more precise delivery of proppant into the blender hopper. Individual, coded containers reduce the risk of product contamination and stranded product, and preserve proppant integrity and mix flexibility at the blender. On single-well locations and when pad access is difficult or limited, we believe PropStream containers are a compact, flexible logistic solution that optimize delivery and wellsite footprint.
At the wellsite, the PropBeast® conveyor system significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment.  Gravity fed loading and unloading results in faster operations and greatly reduces proppant degradation. PropBeast conveyors can transfer approximately 60,000 pounds of proppant per minute into blender hoppers while reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the wellsite by more than 90% versus the widely used pneumatic equipment alternative. 
Silos: Our PropStream silos systems optimize the well pad with more proppant tons per square foot. The silos manage large sand quantities or high rates of pumping in a small footprint. A single 6-pack silo configuration increases wellsite storage more than 30% versus competitor silos. The customizable wellsite configurations meet most space requirements. With a variety of silo configurations and sizes, and crane-free hydraulic lift and transport, our silo systems provide maximum flexibility and improve safety. The PropStream silo system provides flexible, high capacity proppant delivery options using hopper bottom and pneumatic trailers. An innovative conveyor system, the FB Atlas, speeds unloading while a state-of-the-art telescopic discharge tube top-fills silos in significantly less the time of traditional pneumatic systems. We believe the silo systems are the ideal choice for multiwell operations and high proppant intensity well completions.

Competition
There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with which we compete. Our main public and private competitors, including logistics only providers, include:

• | Badger Mining Corporation


• | Black Mountain Sand Holdings, LLC


• | Covia Holdings Corporation (NYSE: CVIA)


• | Emerge Energy Services LP (NYSE: EMES)


• | Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND)


• | Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure Inc (NYSE: SOI)


• | U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SLCA) 


• | Vista Proppants and Logistics Inc.

The most important factors on which we compete are price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics. Demand for frac sand and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the mesh size and amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant.
Our History and Relationship with Hi-Crush Proppants LLC
Overview and History
Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, our previous sponsor, was formed in 2010 in Houston, Texas by members of our management team and our general partner's board of directors. On October 21, 2018, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which the Partnership acquired all of the then outstanding membership interests in the sponsor and the non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership. Upon completion of the acquisition, all of the outstanding incentive distribution rights representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership were canceled and extinguished and the sponsor waived any and all rights to receive contingent consideration payments from the Partnership or our subsidiaries pursuant to certain previously entered into contribution agreements to which it was a party. 
Our Management and Employees
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership. The general partner has the right to appoint all members of the board of directors of our general partner, including at least three independent directors meeting the independence standards established by the NYSE. Our unitholders are not entitled to elect directors or otherwise directly participate in our management or operations. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have limited ability to remove the general partner. Our unitholders are able to indirectly participate in our management and operations only to the limited extent actions taken by our general partner require the approval of a percentage of our unitholders and our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient units to guarantee such approval.
As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership had 720 employees. In addition, we contract our excavation and trucking operations to third parties and accordingly have no employees directly involved in those operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation 
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
Our frac sand mining operations are subject to the oversight of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"), which is the primary regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the commercial silica industry. MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines, and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The MSHA administers and enforces the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSH Act") to substantiate compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, its representatives must perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each surface mining facility in its jurisdiction. To date, these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards at our mining facilities.
We also are subject to the requirements of the OSH Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers with federal oversight provided primarily by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). OSHA has adopted and implemented a Hazard Communication Standard that requires information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public. OSHA regulates the users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and its Hazard Communication Standard. In 2016, OSHA published a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions protective of employees involved in hydraulic fracturing activities including handling of frac sand. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on mining safety and health standards, financial assurance requirements relating to reclamation and restoration of mining property; respirable crystalline silica-related regulatory standards and other legal requirements relating to miner protection.
Health and Safety Programs
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling employee exposure to silica dust, which includes a silicosis prevention program comprised of routine dust sampling, medical surveillance, training, and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with MSHA and OSHA regulations. For health and safety standards, hazard and risk assessment tools and critical task specific awareness, extensive training is provided to employees. We have daily pre-task meetings and safety toolbox meetings at all our plants with personnel and conduct monthly focus fatality hazard prevention assessments as well as quarterly corporate health and safety compliance audits quarterly. Additionally, we perform annual internal health and safety system audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators.
Environmental Matters
We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, environmental permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, air emissions and water discharges, soil and groundwater contamination, waste management, hazardous materials, land use, remediation, reclamation and restoration of properties and natural resources. A variety of federal, state and local agencies implement and enforce these laws and regulations. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing; air emissions, including climate change and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions; water availability and discharges, plant and wildlife protection; and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection.
Federal Regulation
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a Clean Water Act Section 402 permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or an analogous state agency to whom the EPA has delegated implementation of the permit program. With respect to our frac sand processing facilities in Wisconsin and Texas, those state agencies include the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"), respectively. Additionally, we may be obligated to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits issued by the WDNR and TCEQ for stormwater runoff associated with construction activities. Also, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations. Furthermore, regulatory bodies at the federal, tribal, regional, state and local levels in the United States as well as internationally and certain non-governmental organizations have been increasingly focused on climate change issues including GHG emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under authority of the existing CAA that impose reporting obligations with respect to GHG emissions, including methane and restrictions on various regulated entities including our E&P customers, which obligations and restrictions may increase our customers' costs of conducting operations and adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas they produce, which could reduce demand for the fracturing sand that we mine, process and sell.
As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for injuries to persons or damages to natural resources and properties. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
In addition, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA, as well as the WDNR and TCEQ, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all "major federal actions," which could include a major development project, such as a mining operation, significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review, which may result in a delay or cancellation of the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the federal Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with, and are potentially subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
State and Local Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin and Texas where our production facilities are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin, Texas and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
Certain local communities in which we operate, primarily in Wisconsin, have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly restrict the area available for mining activities and require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining, among other regulatory initiatives. In addition, our existing permits granted by local regulatory authorities contain certain restrictions on such matters as hours of operation, permitted decibel levels and lighting, among other matters.
The regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which we do business is potentially subject to amendments or modifications. Planned expansion of our existing facilities as well as the development of new facilities could be significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Delays or inability to obtain required permits for expansion of existing facilities, or the development of new facilities, as well as the increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and worker health, and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, clean-up, and site restoration costs and liens or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the restriction, delay, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease some or all of our operations in a particular area. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction, and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for injuries to persons or damages to natural resources and properties may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state, and local permits required for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Permits 
We operate our facilities under a number of federal, state and local authorizations. We are required to have obtained permits, approvals and/or agreements in order to construct and operate our mining, processing, transloading and material handling facilities and operations in several states. These authorizations address environmental and worker health and safety conditions, and serve to protect public health and welfare. Historically, our properties allocated for mining, and all operational facilities and equipment, have obtained significant approvals necessary for excavation, extraction, and distribution of quality reserves however, there can be no assurance that such new or renewed approvals will be obtained in the future or that such future new or renewed approvals will not require increased costs or operating restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation.
New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that relate to environmental requirements may result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on environmental and mining-related permits and approvals.
