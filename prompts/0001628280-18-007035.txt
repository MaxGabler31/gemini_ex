Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an industry leader for real-time operational intelligence and performance analytics that are used by customers worldwide to assure their digital business services against disruptions in availability, performance and security. Service providers, enterprises and local, state and federal government agencies around the world rely on our solutions to achieve the visibility necessary to optimize network performance, ensure the delivery of high-quality, mission-critical applications and services, provide timely insight into the end user experience and protect the network from attack. Powered by our patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology, our solutions can instantaneously convert network traffic data, often referred to as wire data, into high-value metadata, or "smart data," that can be used by customers to help them identify network and application performance issues, defend their networks from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and rapidly find and isolate advanced network threats. With our offerings, customers can quickly, efficiently and effectively resolve issues that cause business disruptions, downtime, poor service quality or compromised security, thereby driving compelling returns on their investments in their network and broader information technology (IT) initiatives.
Our mission is to enable enterprise and service providers to realize maximum benefit with minimal risk from technology advances, such as internet protocol (IP) convergence, network function virtualization (NFV), software defined networking (SDN), virtualization, cloud, mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT), by managing the inherent complexity in a cost-effective manner. We have been a technology innovator for three-plus decades since our founding in 1984. Our solutions change how organizations manage and optimize the delivery of business applications and services, assure user experience across global internet protocol (IP) networks and help protect networks from unwanted security threats. Through both internal development and acquisitions, we have continually enhanced and expanded our product portfolio to meet the evolving needs of customers worldwide. By using our products to capture and transform terabytes of network traffic data in real time into high-value, actionable information, customers can optimize network performance, facilitate high-quality delivery of services and applications, enhance security and gain insight into the end-user experience. Our solutions are typically deployed by customers as integrated hardware and software, as software only for use in commercial-off-the-shelf hardware or in a virtualized form factor. 
Our operating results are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and quantity of products and services sold, pricing, costs of materials used in our products, growth in employee-related costs, including commissions, and the expansion of our operations. Factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce and enhance existing products, the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products, continued expansion into international markets, development of strategic partnerships, competition, successful acquisition integration efforts, and our ability to achieve expense reductions and make improvements in a highly competitive industry.
 On July 14, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Danaher Corporation’s (Danaher) Communications Business (Communications Business), which included certain assets, liabilities, technology and employees within Tektronix Communications, VSS Monitoring, Arbor Networks and certain portions of the Fluke Networks Enterprise business, which excluded Danaher’s data communications cable installation business and its communication service provider business (the

• | Cybersecurity: DDoS Protection and Cyber Threat Analytics – Computer networks continue to be targeted for cyberattacks that are aimed at disrupting, damaging or otherwise destroying an enterprise’s ability to conduct its business or gaining unauthorized access to corporate applications and stealing valuable information. We provide a range of network security solutions under the NetScout Arbor brand that enable enterprises to protect their networks from high-volume and application-specific DDoS attacks, which are aimed at either overwhelming the network with traffic or over-exercising specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. We have also developed solutions that are used by enterprises to help identify unauthorized intrusions into the network that can pose significant threats to the integrity of sensitive information and key business operations. We are integrating a new set of advanced threat analytics with our ISNG real-time information platform, and expect this offering to be introduced over the next several quarters. We also provide incident response activities with deep-dive network forensics and offer contextual information surrounding a specific alert or incident to enhance investigative capabilities and avoid false positives.

Government Markets
Considered as part of our enterprise vertical, we have built a strong position with federal, state and local government agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Similar to our enterprise customers, government agencies are focused on streamlining and transforming IT into more efficient and more easily managed environments. To accomplish this, agencies are turning to IT solutions that will help simplify managing and assuring their IT environments as well as reduce costs. However, governmental markets differ from enterprise markets primarily due to their purchasing cycles being influenced by potential changes in government administrators, budgetary priorities and allocated funding for key projects.
Telecommunication Service Provider Markets
Today’s service providers are focused on delivering a compelling set of services and ensuring a high-quality user experience, while also striving to minimize operational complexity and costs. This, coupled with the challenge of IP transformation activities and complex technologies such as LTE, NFV, IP-TV, wireless network (WiFi) and cloud services drives the need for a more automated and unified approach to managing service delivery and the subscriber experience. Service providers strive to reduce the cost of service delivery, address increasing complexity, scale their networks cost-effectively and adapt to emerging technologies such as cloud services, NFV and 5G, while assuring high-quality user experiences to retain their revenue base. Service providers are also seeking to gain greater insight into the subscriber experience in order to create upselling opportunities and improve retention. Additionally, service providers must protect their networks from high-volume, increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that consume bandwidth and potentially create outages that impact their business customers. As a result, our service assurance, business intelligence and DDoS solutions can be leveraged by multiple areas within our service provider customers, including network operations and engineering, customer care, marketing and security.

• | Service Assurance for Mobile, Fixed Line and Cable Operators – The fundamental transformation of the mobile network to all-IP enables mobile operators to build highly-scalable service delivery environments to offer new services to meet the growing subscriber demand for data, voice and video-centric services and to consolidate and simplify network operations. Mobile operators use our offerings to gain real-time, detailed IP packet-level insight and core-to-access visibility, which enables them to effectively manage capacity, assess overall network quality, take proactive steps to modify the network before issues impact subscribers, and quickly identify and troubleshoot network problems. In addition to improving the overall return on their network infrastructure investments, mobile operators using our solutions also benefit from improved network quality and unique customer insights - both of which contribute to subscriber acquisition, retention and monetization. The growing demand for high-bandwidth triple-play services, broadband connectivity, content anywhere, IP-TV, on-demand video traffic, new extended WiFi initiatives and carrier Ethernet services presents fixed line and cable multi-system operators with significant revenue opportunities. IP has become the de facto convergence mechanism for access, distribution and core networks, enabling new service offerings and simplifying network operations while reducing total cost of operations. For example, cable operators use our solutions to monitor and manage their local area WiFi connectivity services, ensure the high-quality delivery of video to consumers outside of their homes as well as provide broadband and telephony services targeting small- and medium-sized businesses.

• | Expand our customer base in both enterprise and service provider markets – As a result of the Comms Transaction, NetScout has a larger direct sales force with specialized expertise in targeting the enterprise, service provider and government markets, along with a more extensive global network of value-added resellers and systems integrators. It is our intention to substantially grow our presence in both the enterprise and service provider markets. In the enterprise market, we plan to further expand our relationships with existing large and mid-sized customers, further fortify third-party distribution channels for the enterprise tools products, and help accelerate enterprise adoption of the NetScout Arbor cybersecurity products. We expect to also continue to drive further penetration into our global service provider customer base.


• | Increase market relevance and awareness – NetScout plans to continue to implement marketing campaigns aimed at generating high-quality sales opportunities with both current and prospective enterprise and service provider customers, promoting thought leadership and building the NetScout brand. 


• | Extend our technology partner alliance ecosystem – We plan to continue to develop and fortify alliances with complementary solutions providers that can help us support a larger, more global and more diverse customer base. We plan to continue to enhance our technology value, product capabilities and customer relevance through the continued integration of our products into technology partner products. This includes both interoperability integration efforts, as well as embedding our technology into alliance partner products to gain a more extensive footprint across both enterprise and service provider networks.


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions – We have completed many acquisitions since the Company’s inception that have helped broaden our capabilities, enhance our products and technologies, and better position the Company to meet the needs of a larger base of customers and prospects. In fiscal year 2018, we acquired Efflux Systems, Inc., which was developing technology to detect, analyze and correlate threat activity within enterprise networks. The Efflux technology and engineering talent have been integrated into Arbor Networks in order to support the ongoing enhancement of our advanced threat detection solution.


• | Improve cost structure and drive efficiencies – We plan to balance our investments in key technology, product development, sales and marketing, and other initiatives that will enable us to drive long-term profitable growth with 

8

an ongoing focus on controlling costs and driving efficiencies. For example, we have taken steps to combine the previously separate service assurance and security marketing organizations, consolidate certain back-office functions and IT systems, and continue to eliminate or reduce redundancies associated with pre-existing resources, programs and capabilities. In addition, we are evaluating potential opportunities to restructure or divest certain underperforming, lower margin product lines.
Support Services
Customer satisfaction is a key driver of NetScout’s success. NetScout’s support programs offer customers various levels of high quality support services to assist in the deployment and use of our solutions. We have support personnel strategically deployed across the globe to deliver 24/7 telephone support to our premium customers. Certain support services, such as on-site support activities, are provided by qualified third-party support partners. In addition, many of our certified resellers provide Partner Enabled Support to NetScout end users. This is especially prevalent in international locations where time zones and language, among other factors, make it more efficient for end users to have the reseller provide initial support functions. Our support also includes updates to our software and firmware at no additional charge, if and when such updates are developed and made generally available to our commercial customer base. If ordered, support commences upon expiration of the standard warranty for software. For software, which also includes firmware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 60 to 90 days thereafter. With regard to hardware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 60 days to 12 months thereafter. We believe our warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards. NetScout expects to continue to provide support services for the acquired platforms under existing agreements and plans to explore opportunities to further simplify and standardize its support obligations over the coming years. 
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final product assembly, configuration and testing. We purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers and construct our hardware products in accordance with NetScout standard specifications. We inspect, test and use process control to ensure the quality and reliability of our products. We maintain an ISO 9001 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures and manufacturing facilities comply with standards for quality assurance and process control. We also maintain an ISO 9001:2000 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures comply with standards for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacturing of certain acquired products to high-quality third-party contract manufacturers. 
We generally use standard parts and components for our products, which can be sourced from various suppliers. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from current suppliers. While certain components, such as computer network interface cards, are currently purchased from a single supplier, we have identified alternate suppliers that we believe can be qualified relatively quickly to fulfill our needs should an issue arise with the existing supplier. Our reliance on single source suppliers is further described in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
We manufacture our products based upon near-term demand estimates resulting from sales forecasts and historical fulfillment information. However, since these forecasts have a high degree of variability because of factors that include time of year, overall economic conditions and sales employee incentives, we believe it is prudent to maintain inventory levels in advance of receipt of firm orders to ensure that we have sufficient stock to satisfy incoming orders.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our products, support and services through a direct sales force and an indirect reseller and distribution channel.
 Our direct sales force uses a "high-touch" sales model that consists of face-to-face meetings with customers to understand and identify their unique business challenges and requirements. Our sales teams then translate those requirements into tailored business solutions that allow the customer to maximize the performance of its infrastructure and service delivery environment. Due to the complexity of the systems and the capital expenditures involved, our sales cycles typically take between three and twelve months. We build strategic relationships with our customers by continually enhancing our solution to help them address their evolving service delivery management challenges. In addition to providing a comprehensive solution to meet these needs, we continually provide software enhancements to our customers as part of their maintenance contracts with us. These enhancements are designed to provide additional and ongoing value to our existing customers to promote loyalty and the expansion of their deployment of our products. Existing customer growth is also driven by the expansion and changes in their networks as they add new infrastructure elements, new users, new locations, new applications and experience increasing service traffic volumes.
9

We also maintain an indirect reseller and distribution channel. Sales to customers outside the United States are primarily export sales through channel partners. Our channel partners assist us by improving our reach to customers, extending our presence in new markets, and marketing and selling our products to a broad array of organizations globally. We sell through a range of channel partners including value-added resellers, value-added distributors, resellers, and system integrators, to our enterprise, service provider and government customers. Historically and currently, we have used indirect distribution channels principally as intermediaries on contractual terms for customers with whom we do not have a contract. Our sales force meets with end user customers to present NetScout products and solutions, conduct demonstrations, provide evaluation equipment, recommend detailed product solutions, develop product deployment designs and timelines, and assist in establishing financial and other justifications for the proposed solution. During this selling process, a channel partner, who has contracts with both the end customer and NetScout, may be brought in to facilitate the transaction and to provide fulfillment services. In the case of international channel partners, those services usually also include currency translation and support. In the U.S., fulfillment services are usually limited to invoicing and cash collection. Under this approach, we have limited dependence upon channel partners for the major elements of the selling process. In many cases, there are multiple channel partners with the required contractual relationships, so dependence on any single channel partner is not significant.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, no direct customers or indirect channel partners accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, one direct customer, Verizon Communications, Inc. (Verizon), accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. 
Marketing
Our marketing organization drives our market research, strategy, product positioning and messaging and produces and manages a variety of programs such as advertising, trade shows, industry events, public and analyst relations, social media, direct mail, seminars, sales promotions, and web marketing to promote the sale and acceptance of our solutions and to build the NetScout, ASI, nGenius, Arbor and other applicable product brand names in the marketplace. We also host an annual worldwide user conference, Engage, to provide technical education and awareness, and to promote expanded use of our solutions with these customers.
Key elements of our marketing strategy focus on thought leadership, market positioning, market education, go to market strategies, reputation management, demand generation, and the acceleration of our strategic selling relationships with local and global resellers, systems integrators, and our technology alliance partners. During fiscal year 2018, NetScout began to advance plans to fortify and amplify the NetScout brand while leveraging the nGenius and Arbor brands as core solution-level brands in their respective markets. We expect to continue these initiatives during fiscal year 2019. To align our marketing efforts during the year, we also took steps to consolidate the previously separate NetScout and Arbor marketing organizations. 
Research and Development
Our continued success depends significantly on our ability to anticipate and create solutions that will meet emerging customer requirements. NetScout works closely with its largest enterprise and service provider customers to better understand and address their near-term and longer-term requirements. By better understanding the key, time-sensitive needs of NetScout’s global customer base, we believe NetScout’s development programs will continue to result in enhanced products that are able to meet the increasing challenges of an increasingly complex and dynamic global network environment.
We have invested significant financial resources and personnel into the development of our products and technology. Our continued investment in research and development is crucial to our business and our continued success in the market. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with expertise in various technologies associated with our business and the technologies being deployed by our customers. We plan to continue to enhance and expand our product offerings and capabilities in the near future while integrating key capabilities from acquired product lines as appropriate. As a result, we plan to continue to invest and dedicate significant resources to our research and development activities for both our enterprise and service provider customers. Additionally, we continue to support the legacy product lines that we acquired as a result of the Comms Transaction and work closely with customers on migrating to our next-generation offerings. 
We predominantly develop our products internally, with some limited third-party contracting. We have also acquired developed technology through business acquisitions. To promote industry standards and manifest technology leadership, we participate in and support the activities and recommendations of industry standards bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, and we also engage in close and regular dialogue with our key customers and alliance partners. These activities provide early insight into the direction of network and application performance requirements for current and emerging technologies.

Seasonality
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, quarterly variations in our order bookings as a result of a number of factors, including the length of the sales cycle, complexity of customer environments, new product introductions and their market acceptance and seasonal factors affected by customer projects and typical IT buying cycles. Due to these factors, we historically have experienced stronger bookings during our fiscal third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters. 
Customers
We sell our products to enterprises, service providers and local, state and federal governmental agencies with large- and medium-sized high-speed IP computer networks. Our enterprise customers cover a wide variety of industries, such as financial services, technology, manufacturing, healthcare, utilities, education, transportation and retail. Our telecommunications service provider customer group includes mobile operators, wireline operators, cable operators and cloud providers. A significant number of our service provider customers are mobile operators.
Backlog
We produce our products on the basis of our forecast of near-term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers. We configure our products to customer specifications and generally deliver products shortly after receipt of the purchase order. Service engagements are also included in certain orders. Customers generally may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty. We believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Our combined product backlog at March 31, 2018 was $28.0 million compared to $62.7 million at March 31, 2017. A majority of the backlog relates to customization and integration projects from our acquired business units. In some cases, we have begun these projects but have not yet hit billable milestones. A majority of revenue for these projects is expected to be recognized into revenue throughout fiscal year 2019.
Competition
We compete with many companies in the markets we serve. The service assurance market, including the network and application performance management markets, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented with overlapping technologies and a wide range of competitors, both large and small, who may deliver certain elements of our solution. Consequently, there are a number of companies who have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. Additionally, certain competitors, either due to their size and resources or due to their technological strengths, may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.
Principal competitive factors in our service assurance market include scalability; ability to address a large number of applications, locations and users; product performance; the ability to easily deploy into existing network environments; the ability to offer virtualized solutions; and the ability to administer and manage the solution.
While NetScout faces multiple competitors within the service assurance industry, we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the following factors:

• | we provide a comprehensive service delivery management solution that is capable of addressing the needs of both enterprise and service provider customers and can be scaled to meet the challenges of today’s dynamic service delivery environments;


• | we believe that our solutions provide superior data and compete favorably on a broad range of metrics including the ability to recognize and track a large number of applications;


• | we believe our solutions possess the scalability to support high and increasing levels of data and network traffic;


• | our solutions look at both data and control plane traffic across an entire network; and


• | our ASI technology is optimized to provide real-time information about service performance and real-time alerts to emerging service problems whereas traditional solutions are inherently latent, supporting only forensic-trouble shooting after an issue has occurred.

In the enterprise market, our competitors include companies who provide network performance management, application performance management, infrastructure performance management and other related solutions such as Avaya, CA Technologies, Cisco Systems, Dynatrace, ExtraHop, InfoVista, Keysight, Viavi, Gigamon, Lancope, Corvil, ThousandEyes, New Relic, Riverbed Technology and SolarWinds. In addition, we both compete with and partner with large enterprise

management vendors, such as HP and IBM, who offer performance management solutions. We also compete with smaller, privately held competitors who often focus on specific vertical markets.
In the service provider market, we compete with traditional probe vendors, network equipment manufacturers, big data and analytics vendors, and virtualization vendors. These vendors include Alcatel-Lucent, Astellia, Anritsu, Cisco, Empirix, Ericsson, Dell Technologies, EXFO, Guavas, Huawei, IBM, JDSU, Niksun, Polystar, Radcom, SevOne, Splunk, and Zettics. We face additional competitive threats from startups and new entrants that seek to offer innovative solutions in an industry characterized by rapid technological change.
In the cybersecurity market, we face a range of competitors, including those that may have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that the scalability of our solutions, flexible deployment, and price-performance of our cybersecurity solutions positions us well to compete against both larger network equipment and security companies and smaller niche security solutions vendors. 
In the DDoS solutions market, we compete under the NetScout Arbor brand with a broad range of vendors including Radware, Akamai, F5 Networks, A10 Networks, Fortinet and Corero Network Security. In the market for specialized threat analysis and protection solutions used to identify advanced network threats, we compete with a range of vendors including Darktrace, Vectra Networks, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, RSA (a Dell Technologies business) and other specialist providers.
Our ability to sustain a competitive advantage depends on our ability to deliver continued technology innovation and adapt to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Competitive factors in our industry are further described in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
