 We provide a leading cross-channel, cross-device, enterprise marketing software platform for search, social and display advertising channels, offered as a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solution for advertisers and agencies. Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, allowing them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend across search, social and display advertising channels. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:
  
• | measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users’ search, social and display interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Yahoo! Gemini, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with more than 50 leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.
 Our software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.
 Our predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers increase advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.
 We completed our acquisitions of SocialMoov S.A.S., or SocialMoov, and NowSpots, Inc., which conducted business as Perfect Audience, or Perfect Audience, in February 2015 and June 2014, respectively, to complement our product offerings. SocialMoov provides a software platform that offers advertisers and agencies social advertising tools designed to increase engagement and return on investment. Perfect Audience offers advertisers a SaaS demand-side platform to purchase display impressions and retarget audiences across the web, Facebook and Twitter. Perfect Audience expanded our cross-channel capabilities by adding new programmatic display and social advertising functionality while expanding our audience retargeting tools. The acquisition of SocialMoov is more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Display – Perfect Audience
 Targeting small businesses, Perfect Audience is designed for rapid deployment and offers customers an easy-to-use interface to implement and optimize campaigns across all major networks and across devices.
Technology & Supporting Platform
 We designed our cloud-based platform to support large global advertisers. The majority of our software is written in Java. Our hardware consists of industry-standard servers and network infrastructure. Our standard operating system is Linux. Our software platform is character-set, language, currency, and time-zone independent. Our technology platform has the following key benefits:

• | Scalability. Our platform is designed to handle billions of advertising units across thousands of advertisers, while delivering a responsive browsing and editing experience. If the number of advertisers and resulting computing and storage requirements changes, we can add or remove hardware to our platform to accommodate the demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability. Our customers are highly dependent on the availability of our platform, which is designed to be available 24x7, 365 days a year. We operate our own hardware and use third-party data centers that offer server redundancy, back-up communications and power and physical security.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Our platform manages a large quantity of customer data. We employ technologies, policies and procedures to protect customer data. Our primary third-party data center has SOC 1 attestations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are in the process of upgrading our software platform, which we believe will cost-effectively extend the scalability, speed, resiliency and availability of our services and facilitate our ability to add new features to our products.
 Customers
 We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through advertising agencies that use our platform on behalf of their customers. Advertisers that we serve through our relationships with agencies have historically represented between approximately one-third to one-half our overall revenues. There were no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues, net in 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Competition
 The digital advertising cloud market is highly competitive, fragmented, and subject to changes in both technology and customer behavior. We face significant competition today and expect competition to intensify in the future. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new modules, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Facebook, Inc. and Google Inc. (through its wholly owned subsidiary DoubleClick), and privately-held companies, such as Kenshoo Ltd. We also compete with in-house proprietary tools, tools from publishers and custom solutions, including spreadsheets. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | solution quality, breadth, stability, flexibility and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tangible platform benefits;
--+----------------------------


• | level of customer satisfaction and our ability to respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth and quality of advertiser and agency relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and develop new or improved products and features while maintaining platform speed and stability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to respond to changes in publishers’ APIs;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation; and
--+------------------------------------


• | size of customer base.
--+-----------------------

 Apart from cross-channel platform competitors, we also compete with channel solutions in the display and social advertising markets. Competitors in the display advertising market include public companies such as Criteo S.A. and Sizmek, Inc., as well as privately held companies such as AdRoll Inc. and MediaMath, Inc., while in the social advertising market we compete with public companies such as Salesforce.com (through its wholly owned subsidiary Social.com) and privately-held companies such as Nanigans, Inc., Smartly.io Inc. and 4C Insights, Inc.
 Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of the quality, functionality and breadth of our solution and the availability and knowledgeability of our customer support.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our solutions directly to advertisers and to agencies in a wide range of industries through our global sales team. Our sales cycle can vary substantially by advertiser and agency, but can take up to nine months. We have a number of account executive sales teams organized by geography and market segments. We also have customer success professionals who are responsible for long-term customer satisfaction and retention, renewal, support and driving an increase in the volume of media managed by customers on our platform.
 Our marketing team is focused on driving awareness and demand generation across major markets. This team provides thought leadership in the form of white papers, benchmarking reports, bylines, presenting at industry conferences and speaking to the press. In addition, they are responsible for the creation of field enablement assets such as case studies, blog posts and corporate and product collateral.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our platform. Our research and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative and incremental development cycles. Within our research and development organizations, we have several project teams that focus on platform and feature development for our advertising cloud solutions. Each of these project teams includes engineers, quality engineers and product managers, as needed, responsible for the initial and ongoing development for their projects. Total research and development expense was $26.6 million, $27.8 million and $33.3 million and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 433 regular full-time employees, including 177 employees located outside the United States. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

In January 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to reduce operating expenses and to address our decline in revenues, and to better align our efforts to return to growth. As part of this restructuring plan and through ordinary attrition near the date of this restructuring plan, our headcount was reduced by 54 employees subsequent to December 31, 2017. This restructuring plan is more fully described in Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had three issued patents and seven patent applications pending in the United States.
 We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including two registered trademarks in the United States, the European Union, Australia, China and Japan, one registered mark in Canada and Russia, and unregistered common law marks and pending trademark applications in the United States, Canada, China, Russia, South Korea, and Singapore. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names.
