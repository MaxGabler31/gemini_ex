ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us") is one of the world’s largest out-of-home advertising companies and the only global out-of-home advertising company with scaled presence in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe. With more than 500,000 advertising displays spanning 26 countries, we deliver our clients’ marketing campaigns locally, nationally and internationally, enabling advertisers to engage with consumers when they are on the move through our portfolio of out-of-home advertising displays in many of the most desirable markets across the globe.
Our global asset portfolio primarily consists of billboards, a recognizable medium for delivering big brand messages with broad reach; street furniture displays, which generally focus on urban city centers; airport displays, which target travelers with high “dwell times” and multiple exposures for high-frequency campaigns; other transit displays, such as bus and rail displays, which provide high-profile exposure throughout communities; and spectaculars and wallscapes, which are high-profile, high-impact advertising structures erected in mass consumer locations, designed to attract maximum attention. In addition to our traditional inventory, which displays print out-of-home advertisements, we offer a growing inventory of digital screens, which usually display advertisements for multiple customers and can change messages throughout the course of a day.
Our business model focuses on building strong customer relationships and leveraging our diverse global asset base to provide customized advertising solutions. Our strategy centers on transforming the way we do business by applying cutting-edge technology to the out-of-home advertising experience, including continuing our expansion of digital displays across our entire asset portfolio, expanding our out-of-home programmatic buying capabilities, and utilizing data and analytics to prove attribution and improve campaign planning and effectiveness. This out-of-home technology-fueled transformation is further enhancing our ability to monetize our digital inventory.
Through our extensive display inventory and technology-based enhancements, we have the ability to deliver innovative, effective marketing campaigns for advertising partners globally, in their target markets, connecting brands with the people they want to reach with ideas that enlighten, entertain and influence them. In the U.S., we are present in 41 out of the top 50 designated market areas (“DMAs”), as well as all top 20 DMAs. Our portfolio in our Europe segment spans 17 countries (16 European countries plus Singapore) and is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas. We also have advertising assets in four countries across Latin America. Our diverse global portfolio gives us exposure to a range of macro-economic, regulatory and media environments; the ability to leverage technology investments and leadership across the portfolio; and the opportunity to develop global relationships with the world’s largest advertisers and agencies.
We believe that with our reach, technology and global asset base, we can provide our clients with a more effective method to reach their audiences and deliver their messages in an impactful manner compared to other traditional advertising mediums.
Development of our Business
Prior to May 1, 2019, we were indirectly owned by iHeartCommunications, Inc. and its parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc. (“iHeartMedia”). On May 1, 2019, we separated from, and ceased to be controlled by, iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries (the "Separation"). Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2020, for a full discussion of our corporate history prior to 2020.
In April 2020, following a strategic review of our investment in China, we sold our 50.91% stake in Clear Media Limited (“Clear Media”).
In July 2021, we announced the implementation of a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) succession plan, in which William Eccleshare, former President and CEO, transitioned from the operational leadership of the business and assumed the new role of Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) on January 1, 2022. His responsibilities as part of this role include supporting the management transition and assisting with our ongoing evaluation and review of strategic opportunities to optimize our portfolio. At the same time, Scott R. Wells, previously the Executive Vice President and CEO of the Americas Division of the Company, became President and CEO of the Company and joined the Company’s Board.
In December 2021, we announced that our Board authorized a review of strategic alternatives for our European business, including a possible sale. There can be no assurance that the strategic review process will result in any transaction or particular outcome. We have not set a timetable for completion of the review, may suspend the process at any time and do not intend to make further announcements regarding the process unless and until the Board approves a course of action for which further disclosure is appropriate.

Macroeconomic Indicators and Seasonality
Advertising revenue for our business is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product (“GDP”) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, our international results are impacted by the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically experience our lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is generally offset during the remainder of the year as our business typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, due to the impacts of COVID-19, our seasonal results in 2020 and 2021 varied from historical trends, as further described in the “COVID-19” section below.
Our Industry
    We believe out-of-home advertising enjoys a strong and unique position in the media mix, offering advertisers a cost-effective advertising medium to reach consumers when they are out of the home and close to making purchase decisions.
Out-of-home has the broadest reach among all forms of media, reaching more adults in the U.S. on a weekly basis than radio, TV and the Internet, according to data provided by Scarborough Research. Out-of-home also enables highly targeted advertising campaigns through the selection of specific displays from within a broad portfolio of assets in different locations. With the growth of digital media and the use of data, advertisers can use audience data to effectively reach their consumers by selecting the out-of-home inventory that is most likely to be seen by their target audiences, while also being able to alter advertising messages based on environmental conditions, including time of day and weather, breaking news, changes to advertising strategies and other factors, making them all the more relevant and effective to their target audience.
With the Internet and pervasive presence of smartphones and other mobile devices, other traditional media has faced the challenge of online content migration, which has fragmented their audiences and reduced their reach. Out-of-home, on the other hand, has seen its audience grow through increased urbanization and time spent out of the home. As a consequence, traditional forms of media have lost market share of ad spend, while out-of-home has seen healthy growth. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2021, global revenues in the out-of-home sector are expected to grow at a 4.3% compounded annual growth rate from 2021 to 2026, significantly faster than other traditional mediums. We believe that the proliferation of content and distribution models will continue to lead to the fragmentation of other media audiences, which, along with growing advertising avoidance and ad-blocking technology, may further enhance the attractiveness of out-of-home as an advertising medium.
The out-of-home sector in the U.S., particularly billboards, is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels, which provides stability to our market position. In other advertising locations within the U.S. market (such as airports, other transit hubs or shopping malls) and in international markets, barriers to entry arise due to the complexity of operating major advertising concessions in these environments. We have developed long-standing municipality and other landlord partner relationships across our markets with long-term contracts and strong forward visibility, and we believe we can leverage our expertise to continue to expand our business.
Our Vision
Our vision is to create a unique, mass-reach, media platform that delivers our clients' messages across our distinctive portfolio of digital and traditional displays. We believe out-of-home advertising has opportunities to further improve its value proposition and capture an even greater share of the advertising market, and part of our vision is to make out-of-home advertising as easy to plan, buy and measure as an online campaign, but with increased impact and reduced brand risk.
The key pillars of our vision are:
•Growing the out-of-home medium. Our strategy is, first and foremost, to grow out-of-home advertising’s share of total media spend by leading the technology-driven transformation of the medium, and to grow our share of total out-of-home advertising spend by leveraging our distinctive asset base and operations in key markets with strong demographic strengths.
•Technological leadership. Technological advances continue to transform the out-of-home advertising sector and drive growth in the medium overall. We seek to leverage our leadership position in out-of-home technology and data to enhance out-of-home advertising's core proposition through digital displays, making the medium even more flexible and creative to draw consumer interest; to make out-of-home advertisements even easier to plan and buy; and to provide customers with proof of campaign delivery and return on investment.

•Customer focus. We enable advertisers to engage with consumers through innovative advertising solutions that deliver results by putting our portfolio to work in smart and distinctive ways, including differentiating our products through innovation, sales and service. We seek to further develop our sales excellence by using sophisticated revenue management tools to optimize the yield of our asset base, and we are developing our networks of locations into compelling propositions by selling audience attributes in addition to display location. We believe that this customer focus, as well as the scale of our asset base, allows us to build relationships with key advertisers across our portfolio.
•Opportunistic expansion. Part of our long-term vision is to leverage our operational performance to optimize our capital structure and pursue opportunities for acquisitions in a fragmented marketplace, taking advantage of our technology platform to expand our asset and market portfolio, particularly in the Americas. We believe there are opportunities for expansion in the fragmented out-of-home space, and we remain open to opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders.
Our Strategies
Promote outdoor media spending.
Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and the depth and breadth of our relationships with advertisers, we believe we can drive out-of-home advertising's share of total media spend by using executive, marketing and dedicated sales teams to highlight the value of out-of-home advertising relative to other media. As part of our effort to promote growth in out-of-home advertising’s share of total media, we are focused on developing and implementing improved out-of-home audience delivery measurement systems to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience.
    We are at the forefront of integrating out-of-home media with data analytics and attribution, and we have made and continue to make significant investments in research tools like Clear Channel Outdoor RADAR (“RADAR”), our proprietary suite of data-driven solutions for planning, amplifying and measuring the impact of out-of-home advertising. First launched in our Americas business in 2016, RADAR is the industry’s first suite of campaign planning, amplification and attribution solutions that utilizes aggregated and anonymized mobile data insights to help brands reach desired audiences, reengage these audiences across other media platforms, and measure what happens after someone is exposed to an advertisement on printed and digital displays. RADAR offers advertisers an easier way to unlock the value of out-home advertising by applying approaches and strategies applied in the online world to the physical world’s largest screens. In 2020, we launched RADAR in our European business, with successful roll-outs in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Spain, and in 2021, we introduced RADAR for audience proximity planning in all of our major European markets. We are continuing to roll-out our RADAR suite of solutions in Europe to further elevate the value proposition of our digital footprint in those markets.
Continued digitization of our portfolio and capabilities.
We were an early adopter of digital displays, and we continue to diligently pursue the digital transformation of our business, both domestically and internationally. Digitization of the asset base has been a proven driver of growth in the out-of-home sector and for us in particular. Digital displays enhance the core proposition of out-of-home advertising by improving the quality of display, enabling greater utilization of our best advertising locations through sequential displays, allowing advertisers to plan campaigns around specific days or times of day, and enhancing creativity and contextual relevance of advertisements by tailoring messages according to specific locations, times or other inputs. Digitization of the asset base also provides highly attractive economics, and we believe we have established leadership in unlocking the full benefits of a digital portfolio, including improving sales force capability; developing sophisticated pricing and packaging, campaign delivery, and measurement tools; developing flexible propositions, which allow us to change content by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers’ needs; and automation. Additionally, digital technology allows us to transition from selling space on a display to a single advertiser to selling time on that display to multiple advertisers, creating new revenue opportunities from both new and existing customers. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 22,000 digital displays worldwide, and revenue from digital displays accounted for approximately 36% of our total revenue in 2021, up from 31% in 2020. During the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19, our investments in technology and the global expansion of our digital footprint proved beneficial as they provided us with the flexibility to quickly ramp-up advertising campaigns and most effectively target the right audiences at the right time. Although we continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our use of cash, digital development and expansion continue to be a core element of our capital allocation strategy. The underlying fundamentals of the out-of-home industry remain attractive and are expected to continue to grow faster than traditional advertising over the long-term, with digital out-of-home driving that growth. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2021, the digital out-of-home sector is expected to grow at a 11.6% compounded annual growth rate from 2021 to 2026, and we hope to capture a significant share of this growth.

We are dedicated to expanding our digital capabilities across every aspect of our business as our customers increasingly desire faster response times, enhanced and supplemental data and reporting, increased flexibility and immediate proof-of-performance. We continue to invest in digital infrastructure supporting our back-office functions such as sales proposal preparation and marketing, customer order management, ad serving and billing. We have developed mobile applications used in the field by our production, installation and maintenance teams that improve productivity and proof-of-performance visibility. In addition, we are further transforming the customer order experience with the exploration of self-service and direct buying opportunities and other direct customer interaction capabilities. We believe this digital transformation will enable us to boost execution speed and quality, resulting in strengthened customer-centricity.
Improving our programmatic platform.
 Historically, out-of-home campaigns have been relatively hard to buy, with a fragmented media owner landscape, long lead times and relatively inflexible display periods. However, with continued digitization, we are able to leverage technology for ad-buying, and we have become an industry-leader in providing clients with a flexible buying model via a real-time, biddable digital out-of-home marketplace solution that offers a streamlined buying process as well as greater audience targeting and ad measurement capabilities. This programmatic platform introduces ease and efficiency to the out-of-home advertising sales process by enabling marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory in audience-based packages, giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis and empowering them with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms relative to other traditional ad mediums.
We continue to expand our programmatic buying platform by integrating our digital displays with a best-in-class set of Supply Side Platform (“SSP”) and Demand Side Platform (“DSP”) partners, which provides more buyers and brands access to our displays alongside other digital media and across the greater media-buying ecosystem. We intend to continue focusing on the programmatic space with the objectives of targeting “new” media spend from digital and mobile markets and making our medium easier to buy so that we can continue to capture advertising dollars from other traditional ad mediums.
Investing in data and analytics technologies.
    Out-of-home advertising has historically suffered from the perception that it is less measurable than some of its peers, both in terms of the specific audience that views a campaign and the attribution of post-exposure activity. However, digitization, programmatic buying, and the pervasive presence of smartphones and other mobile devices generates an enormous amount of data, and our investments in data and analytics over the last several years have allowed us to use anonymous, aggregated mobile location data to deliver powerful insights through our suite of RADAR products, helping advertisers understand consumer mobility, behavior and true campaign impact. The insights RADAR provides, in conjunction with flexible ad-buying, enable our clients to deliver highly customized, targeted and measurable out-of-home campaigns, resulting in a more sophisticated approach to delivering messages to the right audiences in the right locations at the right time. By providing our clients with industry-leading measurement tools for optimization of end-to-end out-of-home campaigns, RADAR is helping us to demonstrate the value of out-of-home advertising and is positioning us as an industry innovator and a true partner to our clients.
We believe the technology investments we have made in building out our RADAR platform position us to better meet our customers’ needs. During the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19, our customers continued to use RADAR as a vital tool that allows brands to effectively plan and measure their out-of-home campaigns against specific audience segments, which was especially valuable as traffic patterns and consumer behaviors changed over the course of the pandemic. For example, in the U.S., we saw an increase in average visitation rates to essential businesses during the pandemic as a result of out-of-home ad exposure, which, in some cases, was higher than pre-COVID visitation rates. We believe we can drive revenue growth by continuing to improve audience insights and data solutions to make campaigns more relevant and by utilizing sophisticated tools to unlock value in revenue management and campaign optimization.
Pursuing opportunistic transactions.
Another component of our long-term strategy is to grow our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our portfolio, targeting selective investments in promising market segments, and capitalizing on product and geographic opportunities. In the past, we frequently evaluated potential merger and acquisition situations, and, in many cases, identified opportunities to capture synergies, achieve network effects or expand into new markets through the opportunistic acquisition of companies, assets and technologies that fit in with our long-term strategy and vision. During 2021, we made several asset acquisitions totaling $19.9 million, primarily related to permits and easements in our Americas segment.

We are focused on taking the necessary steps to de-lever our balance sheet, enhance financial flexibility and invest in the growth of our higher margin markets, particularly in the Americas. As we continue to focus on operational efficiencies that drive greater margin and cash flow, we may from time to time in the future consider strategic transactions, including, among other things, the sale of one or more of our markets or businesses. In December 2021, our Board authorized a review of strategic alternatives for our European business, including a possible sale. There can be no assurance that the strategic review process will result in any transaction or particular outcome.
COVID-19
Effects on Economy, Industry & Company
COVID-19 has resulted in volatile economic conditions, business disruptions across the globe and reductions in consumer spending. COVID-19’s extensive impact on the overall economy, and on the global advertising market in particular, has had a significant adverse impact on our business.
Starting in March 2020, we observed lock-downs limiting the behavior and movement of consumers and target audiences, which caused a significant decrease in out-of-home audience metrics indicating a reduction in consumer advertising display engagement; a sharp decline in customer bookings as customers deferred advertising buying decisions and reduced marketing spend; an unprecedented level of requests to defer, revise or cancel sales contracts as customers sought to conserve cash; and customers forced to close their businesses temporarily or permanently. As lock-downs and restrictions were lifted during the latter half of 2020, we saw an increase in mobility, traffic and other out-of-home metrics, and the negative impacts on our business began to lessen. However, due to the evolving nature of COVID-19, the severity of these negative impacts continued to fluctuate based on developments in each geographic region. As a result, our revenue for 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 was significantly below historic norms.
In December 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines were authorized by national regulatory authorities. As vaccine programs were rolled out globally during 2021 and restrictions continued to ease, we saw increases in mobility and positive trends in revenue for each of our segments, with consolidated revenue returning to growth in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year. Currently, the gap to normalized quarterly booking activity is narrowing as most business segment activity is approaching or exceeding historical seasonal levels; however, in certain instances we continue to experience customer advertising buying decisions later in the buying cycle, particularly in Europe. Although we are seeing a recovery in our business, the duration and severity of the effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve and remain uncertain.
Company Response
In response to the pandemic, we used our advertising inventory to facilitate messages of support to medical teams, first responders, delivery professionals, food service workers and many other key workers in all parts of the world; to provide support to governments in helping remind citizens to observe restrictions and how to stay safe; and to shine a light on essential businesses that remained open during the pandemic. In 2021, our Clear Channel U.K. team was awarded Commercial Team of the Year at the coveted Campaign Media Awards for outstanding performance linked to proactive programs focused on supporting advertisers through the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic.
Additionally, as part of our ongoing commitment to local and national business owners, in the U.S. we created an online dynamic hub of solutions called “The COVID-19 Recovery Resource Center,” designed to help businesses reopen, rally and recover. Leveraging data identified through RADAR, this online resource gives local and national advertisers access to curated portals of industry-leading data and insights, creative approaches, digital solutions and other strategies aimed at reigniting their businesses on the heels of the pandemic.
Implementation of Cost-Savings Initiatives and Targeted Liquidity Measures
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken and continue to take various measures to preserve and strengthen our financial flexibility, including contract renegotiations with landlords and municipalities to better align fixed site lease expenses with reductions in revenue; temporary reductions in employee compensation and reductions in headcount; application for European governmental support and wage subsidies; reduction of certain discretionary expenses; and deferral of capital expenditures, site lease and other payments to optimize working capital levels. In 2021 and 2020, we recognized reductions of rent expense due to negotiated rent abatements of $98.5 million and $77.7 million, respectively, and reductions in compensation and rent costs due to European governmental support and wage subsidies of $4.4 million, net of amounts in dispute, and $15.6 million, respectively. As our operating performance has improved, we have continued to reassess and modify these actions accordingly, including ceasing certain temporary operating cost savings initiatives and increasing our investment in our business through additional capital expenditures. Depending on the continued duration and severity of COVID-19, we may consider implementing additional cost savings initiatives in order to provide additional financial flexibility as circumstances warrant.
Table of Contents

In September 2020, we committed to a restructuring plan to reduce headcount in Europe and Latin America and a separate restructuring plan to reduce headcount in our Americas segment. We completed the Latin America portion of our international plan and our Americas plan in 2020. In 2021 we continued to execute on the Europe portion of our international plan, which we revised in April to reflect delays in implementation and additional headcount reductions. Upon termination of the impacted employees in the fourth quarter of 2021, actual costs were less than our previous estimates due to fewer employees being terminated than originally expected. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred total charges for the Europe portion of the international plan of $39.2 million, and remaining costs are not expected to be significant. We expect to pay the related liability in 2022, although payments may be made through the end of the second quarter of 2023 in accordance with the terms of the plan. We anticipate that the Europe portion of the international plan will result in pre-tax annual cost savings in excess of $28 million, in addition to expected annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $7 million and $5 million related to our Americas plan and Corporate operations, respectively. However, actual final charges pursuant to our restructuring plan may be different from our estimates, and there is no guarantee that we will achieve the cost savings that we expect. As the duration and severity of COVID-19 continue to evolve, we will consider implementing new restructuring plans to reduce headcount as circumstances warrant.
We also took certain targeted measures to increase our liquidity, including borrowing $150 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we have since repaid in full; amending our credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Agreement”) to suspend the springing financial covenant through December 2021 and delay the scheduled financial covenant step-down until September 30, 2022; issuing $375 million aggregate principal amount of CCIBV 6.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “CCIBV Senior Secured Notes”) through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary; and borrowing approximately $34.1 million, at current exchange rates, under a state-guaranteed loan program established in response to COVID-19 through one of our non-guarantor European subsidiaries. We also refinanced our 9.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (“CCWH Senior Notes”) with $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “CCOH 7.75% Senior Notes”) and $1.05 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “CCOH 7.5% Senior Notes”).
Looking Forward
Although COVID-19 had significant adverse effects on our results in 2020 and 2021, we saw and continue to see positive trends indicating that as audiences returned, our advertisers returned as well. This rebound, together with new advertisers discovering our medium for the first time, is driving growth in many of our markets ahead of 2019 revenue levels, demonstrating the resilience of our business. As we recover from the economic downturn, we believe our business is even better positioned to meet our customers’ needs due to the technology investments we continued to make, specifically in expanding our digital footprint and building out our RADAR platform and programmatic solutions. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to return to growth as recovery takes hold and we emerge from the pandemic.
We remain focused on pursuing our ongoing priorities of revenue expansion, free cash flow generation and investments in profitable growth, and we intend to continue executing upon our long-standing outdoor advertising strategies while closely managing expenses and focusing on achieving operating efficiencies throughout our businesses. We believe that the underlying fundamentals of our industry and our business, the strength of our portfolio, and the strategic steps we have taken to bolster our financial position will continue to support our long-term strategies, and we expect to capitalize on improving trends by continuing to take a disciplined approach in managing our use of cash while remaining focused on securing new business and building out our digital network. However, the duration and severity of COVID-19’s impacts continue to evolve and remain uncertain. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of COVID-19 on our business.
Our Business Segments
    We have two reportable business segments: Americas, which consists of operations primarily in the U.S., and Europe, which consists of operations in Europe and Singapore. Our remaining operating segment, Latin America, does not meet the quantitative threshold to qualify as a reportable segment and is disclosed as “Other.” Prior to the sale of Clear Media on April 28, 2020, “Other” also included China. Americas, Europe and Other represented 52%, 45% and 3%, respectively, of our 2021 revenue.
Americas
Overview
We are one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies in the U.S., with operations in 41 of the 50 largest U.S. markets, including all of the top 20 DMAs, and reaching more U.S. adults monthly in the top 10 DMAs than any other out-of-home media company. Our Americas segment generated 52%, 53% and 47% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Table of Contents

Americas revenue, which is generated through both local and national sales channels, is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our printed and digital displays, primarily billboards and transit displays, including airports. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 69,000 advertising displays in the Americas. Our Americas business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations where our portfolio of assets provides advertisers with compelling opportunities to reach a mass audience in a cost-effective way, and the scale of our advertising networks enables us to deliver highly-targeted campaigns based on the specific audience delivered by individual panels. The majority of our Americas revenue is from large-format billboards, which are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly-visible and heavily-trafficked. Our footprint is protected by significant barriers to entry for traditional large-format roadside advertising, as well as the strong working relationships required with landlords and local governments. We seek to capitalize on our network, diversified product mix and long-standing presence in our existing markets to maximize revenue.
Competition
The out-of-home advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several other large companies such as Outfront Media, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. Out-of-home advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong customer relationships are also critical components of sales. We have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify customer accounts and establish continuing revenue streams.
We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including mobile, social media, online, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail and other forms of advertisement. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2021, out-of-home advertising accounts for approximately 4% of the advertising market in the U.S., excluding search advertising.
Sources of Revenue
The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Billboards: | | | | | 
Bulletins | 64 | % | | 65 | % | 60 | %
Posters | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %
Transit displays(1) | 14 | % | | 14 | % | 17 | %
Street furniture displays(1) | 3 | % | | 2 | % | 4 | %
Spectaculars/wallscapes | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Other(2) | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1)Revenue from our transit, including airport, and street furniture displays was the most significantly impacted by lockdowns and mobility restrictions resulting from COVID-19.
(2)Includes production revenue and other non-advertising revenue.
Approximately 35%, 31% and 32% of our total Americas revenue during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was from digital displays.
Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors, including location, competition, size of display, board occupancy, illumination, market and gross rating points (the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of market population). The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by Geopath, an independent organization that provides audience measurement for the out-of-home industry in the U.S. using a range of dynamic data sources, including anonymous location and trip data from hundreds of millions of connected vehicles and smartphones, to understand the number of people passing a display during a defined period of time, along with insights into their demographic characteristics. The margins on our billboard contracts tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked.
Billboards. Our Americas billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters and is available in both printed and digital formats. Because of their greater size and impact, we typically receive higher rates for bulletins than we do for posters.
Table of Contents

•Bulletins, which are most commonly 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, are the largest and among the most impactful standard-sized out-of-home media formats. They are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our customers may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning their advertisements are rotated within the network to increase the reach of the campaign. The duration of our customer contracts for traditional bulletin displays are typically 12 weeks or longer.
•Posters, which can vary in size but are commonly approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, are often used as a full market coverage medium for reach and frequency, while junior posters, which are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide, are often used for their proximity to retail outlets where they can stimulate sales. Posters are generally located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins. Advertising space on these displays is generally purchased in four-week periods.
•Premiere displays, which use one or more poster panels but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our customers with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns, combining the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters. The duration of our customer contracts for premiere displays are typically eight weeks or longer, although shorter programs are available.
    Transit Displays. Our Americas transit displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, are advertising surfaces within transit systems, including the common areas of airports and rail stations, and on various types of vehicles, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains and trams. The duration of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from four weeks to one year, although some are longer.
    Street Furniture Displays. Our Americas street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, news-racks and other public structures and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes. We are generally responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures, and we often sell advertising on our street furniture displays as part of a network package that includes multiple street furniture displays. Advertising space on these displays is generally purchased in four-week periods.
    Spectaculars and Wallscapes. Spectaculars are large, elaborate, customized display structures that are designed to gain maximum attention with eye-catching special effects, such as video, multi-dimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices, moving parts and other embellishments. Customer contracts for these displays, which are located in New York City's Times Square and Las Vegas, typically have terms of at least one year. A wallscape is a display that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures. Custom-designed for long-term exposure, wallscapes often become landmarks in a city. The majority of our wallscapes are located in Los Angeles and New York City’s Times Square, and advertising space on these displays is generally purchased for extended periods.
Other Revenue. In the majority of our markets, our local production staff can perform the full range of activities required to create and/or install advertising copy, including creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing, and installing the copy on displays. The remainder of the revenue from our Americas segment consists primarily of fees related to these activities, including vinyl or poster orders, production, embellishments and installation services.
Digital. Our scale has enabled cost-effective investment in new display technologies, such as digital billboards and smaller-format LCD screens. Digital advertising allows for high-frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations, enabling us to offer our clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility. Digital spots can be purchased in a variety of time lengths, from one day up to one year, and the dynamic nature of digital displays allows us to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers, optimizing yield on a per structure basis. During 2021, we deployed 94 new digital billboards.

Inventory
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 69,000 advertising displays in the Americas, including more than 1,500 digital billboards. Combined with our smaller format digital displays in airports and on shelters, we had a total of more than 4,000 digital displays across the U.S. The following table shows the approximate percentage of total displays by category for our Americas segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,

Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Operations
We typically own the physical structures on which our customers’ advertising copy is displayed. We manage the construction of our structures centrally and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements or executed long-term management agreements. The site lease terms generally range from 1 to 20 years, with options to renew in many cases. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is material to our overall operations.
The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are located require various permits, which are granted for the right to build, maintain and operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with state and local laws and regulations. Permits are typically granted in perpetuity by the state and/or local government, conditioned upon compliance with state and local laws, and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal fee or no fee.
Our rights to place transit displays within the common areas of airports and rail stations or on vehicles within transit systems and to place street furniture displays in the public domain, as well as the rights to sell advertising on such displays, are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or, in the case of transit displays, may be negotiated with private transit operators. These contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 10 years for transit displays and 10 to 20 years for street furniture displays. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on these displays, we pay the municipality or transit authority a minimum fee or a share of the advertising revenue we earn on the displays, depending upon the terms of the contract. For street furniture displays, we are also generally responsible for maintenance costs.
Printed advertising copy is primarily printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or polyethylene material supplied by the advertiser. These prints are then transported to the display site and secured to the display surface, either by being wrapped around the face of the site or affixed to a hardware anchoring system on the display site. Digital displays are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change advertising copy on a large number of displays as needed. Our operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of our inventory for display defects and taking necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time.
Sales and Marketing
    We are redefining how outdoor media is bought and sold, working closely with customers, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated approaches to delivering the right audiences in the right locations at the right time. One example is our programmatic effort to sell digital billboard advertisements using automated advertisement sales technology to introduce ease and efficiency to the out-of-home advertising sales process and enable better targeting of digital billboard advertising. Another example is our Proposal Team, which provides proposal preparation and marketing support for our key multi-market sales efforts. A third area is our proof-of-performance delivery platform that is leading the industry in providing transparency when the ad is delivered, accessible via an application programming interface to allow partners to pull proof-of-performance information into whichever system they choose. Additionally, in light of the effects of COVID-19, we have expanded our client-direct selling initiatives with a focus on selling creative ideas as opposed to specific billboard locations as advertisers work to realign their advertising campaigns.

RADAR
    RADAR is the industry’s first suite of data-driven campaign planning, attribution and amplification solutions, designed to utilize anonymous, aggregated mobile location data to help brands reach certain audiences and understand what happens after someone is exposed to an out-of-home advertisement. We ensure our data partners undergo a data privacy impact assessment process in order to ensure compliance with data privacy laws. The individual tools within the suite are as follows:
•RADARView® is our campaign planning and visualization tool, which combines several data sources, including industry standard audience measurement and anonymized, privacy-compliant location data from tens of millions of mobile devices, enabling advertisers to optimize their campaigns to most efficiently reach specific audience segments;
•RADARConnect® amplifies out-of-home campaigns by re-targeting exposed audience groups with ads on mobile and desktop devices, providing clients with a simple, easy-to-activate advertising solution that both extends reach and drives further impact of their out-of-home advertising campaigns;
•RADARProof® is our attribution measurement tool, which uses anonymized and aggregated data to understand the behavior of groups of people after they've been exposed to specific campaign ads. The behavior of these "exposed audiences" is typically compared to a control group of people who have not seen the campaign ads, enabling us to demonstrate to advertisers the impact of their campaigns on a variety of business objectives, including product purchases, store visits, application downloads, TV tune-in, brand awareness, purchase intent and more; and
•RADARSync® facilitates data integration by letting advertisers leverage the benefits of the RADAR tools using their preferred data, while also facilitating the ingestion of RADAR out-of-home campaign performance data into media agencies’ and advertisers’ own multi-touch attribution models, allowing the value of out-of-home to be understood as an integrated element of today's predominantly digital-led advertising and marketing programs.
We continue to strengthen our RADAR platform through partnerships aimed at further improving our data analytics capabilities and our ability to measure the impact of our assets on consumer reach and decision-making, which is helping to demonstrate the unique attributes of our platform and strengthen our relationships with our customers.
Europe
Overview
Our Europe segment spans 17 countries in seven regions: France, the U.K., the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland), Southern Europe (Italy and Spain), other European countries (Ireland, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) and Singapore. We are the largest out-of-home advertising provider in several of these countries and consistently rank as a top out-of-home player in all of our European locations. Our Europe segment generated 45%, 43% and 41% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Europe revenue is primarily generated from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, retail displays and transit displays, and the majority of our customers are advertisers targeting national or regional audiences whose business generally is placed with us through media or advertising agencies. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio included approximately 430,000 displays. (Our Europe display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small individual displays. As a result, our Europe display count is not comparable to our Americas display count, which includes only unique displays.)
Our Europe portfolio is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas and spans many of Europe’s major cities, including London, Paris, Madrid and Rome, as well as Singapore. We believe our Europe business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience, making out-of-home advertising a cost-effective medium for advertisers compared to other traditional media, as measured by cost per thousand persons reached. Europe out-of-home advertising is an urban medium, and street furniture displays are our largest source of advertising revenue. Located at the heart of cities and close to the point-of-sale, street furniture displays have a location advantage, which advertisers leverage to drive foot traffic to their retail locations and influence purchase decisions. Additionally, our broad asset base is enabling us to develop and market scaled digital networks with a focus on roadside, which can be sold flexibly by time of day or day of week, which aligns well with rising advertiser expectations regarding our scale and the strength of our technology in targeting the right audiences on the move.

Competition
    The out-of-home advertising industry in Europe is highly competitive, consisting of several other large companies such as JCDecaux SA and Global Media & Entertainment, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. Out-of-home advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. Our entrepreneurial business model allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service.
    We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including mobile, online, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail and other forms of advertisement. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2021, out-of-home advertising accounts for approximately 5% of the advertising market in Western Europe, excluding search advertising, with out-of-home advertising’s share of the advertising market varying by country based on a number of factors, including regulation, sophistication, sociocultural aspects and historic media buying trends.
Sources of Revenue
The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Europe segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Street furniture displays | 52% | 49% | 45% 
Billboards | 17% | 19% | 19% 
Retail displays | 15% | 14% | 14% 
Transit displays(1) | 7% | 8% | 12% 
Other(2) | 9% | 10% | 10% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%

(1)Revenue from our transit displays was the most significantly impacted by lockdowns and mobility restrictions resulting from COVID-19.
(2)Includes advertising revenue from small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, operation of public bike programs and production revenue.
    Approximately 35%, 31% and 29% of our total Europe revenue during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was from digital displays.
    Similar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays, and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic.
Street Furniture Displays. Our Europe street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, telephone boxes and other public structures. Our print street furniture is typically sold to customers as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks.
    Billboards. Our Europe billboards vary in size across our networks, with the majority being similar in size to the posters used in our Americas business. Our Europe billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium and classic billboards and is available in both printed and digital formats. They are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks, although long-term customer contracts with terms of up to one year are also available.
•Premium billboards, which are typically larger in format, generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked, as well as being located in iconic city center locations. Our customers may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards. Because of their greater size and impact, as well as the high frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital premium billboards. Not all of our premium billboards are digitized due to a number of factors such as regulatory consents and commercial considerations.
•Classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our Europe markets and generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater breadth of demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards.

    Retail Displays. Our Europe retail displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one to two weeks.
    Transit Displays. Our Europe transit displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, consist of advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one week to one year, although some are longer.
Other Revenue. The remainder of the revenue from our Europe segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from other small displays, production revenue, and non-advertising revenue from the following sources:
•Sales of street furniture equipment and cleaning and maintenance services. In several of our European markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities.
•Operation of public bike programs. We also have a public bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities. In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities.
Digital. Our digital network is a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. Our scale has enabled cost-effective investment in digital display technology, and we continued to expand our digital footprint this year, adding 1,361 digital displays in 2021 for a total of more than 17,500 digital displays as of December 31, 2021. Through our digital brands, including Clear Channel Play and Adshel Live, we are able to offer networks of digital displays in multiple formats and environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. As we continue to expand our digital reach across European cities, we are well-positioned to deliver increased flexibility and enhanced contextual relevance, at scale, improving our ability to meet brands’ needs.
Operations
We generally build our portfolios of advertising locations by entering into medium to long-term contracts with landlords such as municipalities, private individuals and shopping malls. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts.
•Our rights to place street furniture in the public domain and to sell advertising on such street furniture are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and transit authorities, which typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our Europe and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In Europe, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information. In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. We pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the displays and are typically required to pay minimum guaranteed amounts. 
•We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years. 
•Our rights to place displays in retail locations and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators, either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. These contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years.
•Similar to street furniture, our rights to place transit displays on vehicles or within transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. These contracts generally have terms ranging from two to five years.
We generally outsource the manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers located in many of our markets, although much of our inventory is manufactured in China and the U.K. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is significant to our overall operations.
•The design of street furniture structures is typically done in conjunction with a third-party supplier, and our street furniture sites are posted by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs.

•Digital displays generally use LCD or LED technology. The manufacture and installation process is generally the same as for traditional sites; however, specialist suppliers are used to supply the LED tiles or LCD screen displays, and there may be additional factors, such as electrical supply and network connectivity, involved during design and construction.
Media or advertising agencies often provide our customers creative services to design and produce advertising copy, which is delivered to us either in digital format or in the traditional format of physical printed advertisements. For digital advertising campaigns, the digital advertisement is received by our content management system and is then distributed to our digital displays, which are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change messages throughout the course of a day. For traditional advertising campaigns, the printed advertisement – whether in paper or vinyl – is shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us or third parties. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays.
Sales and Marketing
We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition based on our sophisticated sales approach, emphasis on innovation and strong client relationships. In addition to our core focus of building relationships with our advertising customers and their agencies, a key focus is to continue developing sophisticated pricing, packaging and programmatic selling tools and techniques – in particular pricing and packaging models that leverage the capabilities and benefits of digital display networks. 
In 2021, we announced a branded programmatic proposition called Clear Channel LaunchPAD, which serves as a customer gateway for programmatic, automation and direct channels. Clear Channel LaunchPAD Programmatic connects our premium digital out-of-home inventory to SSPs and digital buying points, bringing out-of-home into the omni-channel buying ecosystem. This proprietary programmatic platform, which enables marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory using real-time bidding, simplifies the buying process and provides us with an important avenue to leverage our scale and technology to target new advertising partners. It also brings significant value to advertisers, allowing brands to connect at the right time with consumers through multiple touchpoints, plan real-time digital out-of-home campaigns, and control exactly when, where and at what times their ads are displayed. Clear Channel LaunchPAD is now live in Switzerland, Spain, the U.K., Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and France, with plans underway to introduce it to other countries, including in Scandinavia.
Technologies and Tools
Through our digital transformation, we are committed to making our inventory more accessible to both new and existing advertisers. Additionally, we seek to achieve greater consumer engagement by delivering powerful, flexible and interactive campaigns that open up new possibilities for advertisers to engage with their target audiences.
We continue to make progress in utilizing data and technology to help advertisers plan and adjust their campaigns, which has been particularly important as brands navigate the audience and environmental impacts of changing COVID-19 restrictions. In 2020, we launched our RADAR offering in Europe, with successful roll-outs of RADARView® in the U.K. and Spain and, in 2021, we introduced further audience proximity planning in all of our major European markets. This offering, including the supplier selection processes and methods, has been adapted from our U.S. offering in order to comply with European data privacy laws, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). As we continue to roll-out our RADAR suite of solutions, which is now gaining traction in all of our major European markets, we are further elevating the value proposition of our digital footprint by helping advertisers identify and reach target audience segments across multiple verticals and markets.
Additionally, part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing technologies, such as beacons, small cells, way-finding stations and provision of Wi-Fi, in our street furniture network as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients’ advertisements. We also work closely with municipalities to develop smart city products, including interactive digital mapping solutions, information kiosks and Wi-Fi hubs, which also provide additional advertising opportunities.
Other
Latin America
In addition to our Americas and Europe segments, we also have operations in Latin America, including in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru. Our Latin America business generated 3%, 2% and 3% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The majority of our Latin America revenue is generated from the sale of advertising space on billboards and street furniture displays. As of December 31, 2021, our Latin American portfolio included approximately 5,500 displays, including more than 700 digital displays. In addition, we generate revenue from public bicycle rental programs, which operate in a similar manner to our public bicycle rental programs in Europe.

China
On April 28, 2020, we sold our 50.91% stake in Clear Media, a company based in China whose ordinary shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Our stake in Clear Media generated 2% and 8% of our revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Human Capital Resources
    Our mission is to connect brands and consumers by delivering innovative advertising insights and solutions while enhancing our communities. We believe that our continued success and position as an industry leader is dependent upon successful execution of this mission, and a critical component in achieving this mission is attracting, motivating and retaining great people who allow us to continue to find new and innovative ways to serve our customers and communities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 4,600 employees, including approximately 1,500 employees in the U.S. and 2,700 employees in our Europe segment, with the remainder in Latin America. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
We have a continual focus on talent management in our organization with an annual talent identification process and development programs in place to ensure we have sufficient succession planning strategies for critical roles. Additionally, we have a robust annual goal-setting and performance management process, in line with our global strategy of ensuring that all employees have a connection and purpose aligned to our overall company goals. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create strong teams and vibrant culture at every level of our organization through our core values of integrity, innovation, excellence and safety. We also strive to offer a fair and competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work, provide a safe workplace, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact. We believe people can achieve their full potential when they enjoy their work, so it is our priority to provide a workplace where growth, success and fun go hand in hand. We formally survey our employees on a periodic and ongoing basis to measure engagement and identify areas for improvement. In 2021, we launched employee engagement/fairness surveys in the Americas and Europe and received a high response rate of over 85%, with our overall engagement scores up from previous years.
COVID-19 has affected everyone worldwide and, as a global company bolstered by a diverse workforce, our priority is to protect the safety, health and well-being of our employees and their families. In recognition of the unique challenges facing our people around the world during this time, in 2020 we launched Our People Pledge in order to reaffirm and emphasize our commitment to putting our people first, as well as to guide and support our people through this challenging period. Our People Pledge, which is consistent with the Company’s foundational core values, identifies five core commitments to which we hold our Company and our employees accountable — recognizing the importance of the global Clear Channel community, being fair and transparent in our decision-making approach to our people, being flexible and open to new ideas, partnering with our customers and communities, and looking towards the future. We believe that in doing so, we’ll emerge from this period of uncertainty as a stronger global Clear Channel community.
Code of Business Conduct
We are deeply committed to promoting a culture of ethical conduct and compliance. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all employees as well as officers and all members of the Board, reinforces our core values and helps drive our workplace culture of compliance with ethical standards, integrity and accountability. Training on the Code is mandatory upon employment and is provided on an annual basis. Highlights from our Code include a no-retaliation policy for anyone who, acting in good faith, notifies us of a possible violation of the Code, our policies or the law; a commitment to human rights and labor protections in all of our operations, and the expectation that our business partners uphold the same standards; and an anti-corruption policy that prohibits offering, attempting to offer, authorizing or promising any bribe or kickback for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an unfair advantage.

Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, help us achieve our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with market-competitive compensation packages that include base salary and annual incentive bonuses tied to Company and division performance and individual performance targets, in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Recognition is provided through quarterly newsletters and an annual formal recognition program. Our sales employees are incentivized through sales commission programs, with our highest performing individuals further awarded through formal recognition programs. Our executives and certain other employees receive long-term equity awards that vest based on our relative total shareholder return or over a defined period. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests. We also provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of affordable and convenient healthcare and insurance benefits, programs to help ensure financial security, enhanced wellness initiatives, retirement savings plans and various other benefits.
Advancing Diversity and Inclusion
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We respect and embrace diversity of thought and experience and believe that a diverse workforce produces more innovative insights and solutions, resulting in better products and services for our customers. As we bring brands face-to-face with people, we believe our teams need to be as diverse in their composition and outlook as the audiences we reach every day, and we are committed to encouraging a safe and inclusive environment where every employee can be their authentic self across all levels of the organization, is valued for their contributions, and has the opportunity to enhance partnerships where we live, work, and serve.
We have an ongoing priority to enhance diversity of our workforce and have implemented diversity and inclusion strategies to amplify our outreach to diverse talent pools across our global business. Amidst calls for sociopolitical change we have seen play out in all corners of the world, we have reinforced our commitment to our people and to promoting diversity and inclusion, as well as the need to do more to continue improving and evolving as an organization. In an effort to further promote a diverse and inclusive environment, we have dedicated Diversity and Inclusion committees in all of our divisions that run engagement programs aimed at improving the experience of diverse groups across our Company. We have also deployed a training curriculum for employees designed to raise diversity and inclusion awareness and surveyed employees globally to identify and prioritize company-wide initiatives.
In 2021, we led several key diversity and inclusion initiatives, including deepening our involvement with our communities by using our digital out-of-home displays to amplify diversity celebrations, developing our employee’s careers through a pilot mentorship program, and building a sense of inclusion across the workplace through Employee Resource Groups with the mission of providing a safe, welcoming and supportive environment to empower employees to fearlessly address their unique needs and perspectives.
Commitment to Safety and Wellness
Safety is one of our core values, and we are committed to providing our employees with a safe workplace and prioritizing the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees. One of the ways in which we do this is by offering an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), which gives employees access to licensed professional counselors and other specialists at no cost for help with balancing work and life issues. We have also implemented an Employee Relief Fund to help employees facing financial hardship immediately after a disaster or during unanticipated and unavoidable personal emergencies. We also comply with all safety regulations in our local markets.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented workplace initiatives that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate and which comply with government regulations. This included transitioning the vast majority of our employees to work-from-home for a large portion of 2020, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Beginning in late 2020, we started to execute on our phased Return-to-Office plan on an office-by-office basis, ensuring compliance with applicable regulations as well as local health authority guidance and implementing robust safety procedures and protocols to protect our employees. Given the evolving-nature of COVID-19 developments, our Return-to-Office plan is nimble, allowing each office the flexibility to return to work-from-home directives as necessary based on local conditions. Using our Future of Work values, we have ensured a consistent values-based approach across all markets using a locally-led approach that takes into consideration the varying cultural norms, legal restrictions and size and scale of the business.
Table of Contents

In line with our priority of protecting the safety, health and well-being of our employees, we surveyed our employees in 2020 to determine how we could more effectively provide support. This survey, administered by a third party, focused on the following areas: concern and connection; virtual work effectiveness; senior leadership response and communication; and employee wellness, health and safety. Utilizing the results of this survey, we developed an action plan to face the challenges of COVID-19 and remain engaged and productive, including communicating the availability of counseling under the EAP through company-wide notifications and Employee portal updates; providing COVID-19 related resources on locating vaccines, work-from-home health tips and COVID-19 trainings, among other things; and regular communication of our progress through all-hands meetings, regional and departmental meetings and other forms of communication.
Community Involvement
One of our guiding principles is making a difference in the communities we serve, and our corporate social responsibility initiatives are an important part of our culture. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. As a company, we endeavor to use our resources and products to make meaningful contributions to our communities and have collaborated with local and national organizations globally in initiatives to improve health and public safety; to create a sustainable environment; and to promote arts, education and cultural diversity. We also provide employees the opportunity to give back through our Local Spirit Day of Service program, which offers employees a day of paid volunteer time each year to engage with our local communities.
Climate Change and Sustainability
We are spearheading projects and initiatives that aim to drive sustainability and reduce our environmental impact. We have announced a commitment to be Carbon Net Zero before 2050 across our divisions, in alignment with the 2016 Paris Agreement, and are in the process of designing a Company-wide Environmental Program to coordinate and progress emissions reduction initiatives already undertaken by key business units. In addition, as we continue our digital transformation, we have continued to focus on the efficiency of our technologies (including, but not limited to, converting a large portion of our illuminated displays to LED lighting, using light sensors and dimming technology that control brightness and exploring alternative energy sources) and on developing innovative products and services with a reduced environmental footprint. Our sustainability efforts are underpinned by our various industry commitments, including to Ad Net Zero, the UN Global Compact and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Regulation of our Business
Regulations have a significant impact on the out-of-home advertising industry and our business. As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws.
The out-of-home advertising industry in the U.S. is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (“HBA”), regulates out-of-home advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the U.S. (“controlled roads”). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates state compliance programs, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs, and requires just compensation if a state or other government agency or entity compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a controlled road. To satisfy the HBA’s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing, placement and permitting of out-of-home advertising structures. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads at the owner’s expense and without compensation. In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes, regulating those items described above, and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements. Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction, and, in some instances, we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews. As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments also regulate the construction of new signs. Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures, and some allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above. In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations).

From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards. Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation has been earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.
Each of the international countries in which we operate has its own regulatory regime and, in some cases, more than one regulatory regime. International regulation of the out-of-home advertising industry varies by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. In addition, many of these regulations set specific guidelines for the development of new out-of-home locations and address the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, location and permitting of billboards as well as the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays. For example, most European Union (“E.U.”) countries, among other nations, have banned out-of-home advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising.
We intend to continue to expand the global deployment of digital billboards, which display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that changes up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from out-of-home advertising, for the right to use out-of-home advertising assets, or for the privilege of engaging in the out-of-home advertising business. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our out-of-home advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size of the billboard and type of display technology. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue.
These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the out-of-home advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the out-of-home advertising industry. However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our business.
Privacy and Data Protection
We obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including our websites, web pages, interactive features, social media pages and mobile applications. We also obtain anonymous and aggregated audience behavior insights about consumers from vetted third-party data providers. We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes and may coordinate out-of-home client campaigns with online advertising campaigns run by our business partners, including interstitial ads and push notifications. In addition, we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from our employees, users of our public bike services, our business partners and consumers who interact with our digital panels, including through QR codes and beacon technology. Collecting and processing PII subjects us to certain privacy and data security laws and regulations, as well as risks of unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, PII.
We are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted or enforced in ways that could harm our business or limit the services we are able to offer. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in certain states in the U.S. and most other countries require companies to implement specific information security controls and legal protections for certain types of PII. Likewise, every state in the U.S. and most other countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their PII. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

In the U.S., three states have now passed comprehensive privacy laws. In late 2020, the state of California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which expands and modifies the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). In 2021, the states of Virginia and Colorado each enacted comprehensive privacy laws that resemble the E.U.’s GDPR. In general, the California, Virginia and Colorado laws provide consumers with privacy rights, such as the right to access the PII collected about them, to request that such PII be deleted, to opt-out of the sale of their PII and to opt-out of the sharing of their PII for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. The CPRA and the Virginia and Colorado laws will become effective in 2023. We expect to leverage many aspects of our existing privacy compliance efforts to adapt to these regulatory changes, but given the novelty of the Virginia and Colorado laws and the relative lack of regulatory guidance under the CPRA, it is not fully known how these state privacy laws will be interpreted and enforced. We expect to incur additional compliance costs in adapting our current privacy program, and we recognize that governments may impose new data collection restrictions on us and on our business partners conforming with other global restrictions. A growing number of other U.S. states are proposing new privacy legislation, which has created the need for multi-state compliance. We continue to monitor and adapt to this evolving privacy landscape.
Internationally, we have implemented a legal and information security-led approach to address our compliance obligations under the E.U. GDPR, the U.K. GDPR, the E.U. Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation, the U.K. Data Protection Act, the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, in line with our legal obligations and risk profile. We are also in the process of adapting our data transfer mechanisms in accordance with significant E.U. privacy case law seeking to further control U.S. transfers of E.U. personal data. Fines for noncompliance with the E.U. GDPR are significant and can be up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.
Despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. There continues to be significant and organized cybercrime and cyber-attack activity, and no organization is fully immune to cybercrime, cyber-attacks and their impacts. Any failure or perceived failure by us to protect our information or information about our employees, customers and consumers, or to comply with our policies or applicable legal and regulatory requirements, could result in damage to our business and loss of confidence in us; damage to our brands; the loss of users of our services, consumers, business partners and advertisers; and proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, including regulatory fines and private litigation, any of which could harm our business.
