Our Corporate History and Background
 
The Company was organized on October 4, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name SMSA Ballinger Acquisition Corp. to effect the reincorporation of Senior Management Services of Heritage Oaks at Ballinger, Inc., a Texas corporation, mandated by a Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court For the Northern District of Texas for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
 
On August 1, 2013 we entered into a share purchase agreement with Orsolya Peresztegi pursuant to which she acquired 9.5 million shares of our Company Common Stock, par value $0.001 ("Common Stock") for $9,500 cash, or $0.001 per share. As a result of this transaction, there was a change in control of the Company, resulting in Ms. Peresztegi owning 94.7% of our 10,030,612 outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. As a result of the transaction, Ms. Peresztegi became the Company's sole director and officer.
 
We also entered into the Snotarator Distributor Agreement on August 1, 2013 which granted us the exclusive right to sell products of Snotarator LLC, a Frisco, Texas based Texas limited liability company owned by Orsolya Peresztegi and her husband, Kevin Halter, Jr.  The distribution rights were limited to countries within South America.   Since the Company had no prior experience in selling or marketing consumer products in South America, on April 15, 2014 we entered into a letter agreement with HFG (the "HFG Consulting Agreement") pursuant to which we engaged Halter Financial Group, Inc. ("HFG"), a Dallas, Texas consulting firm, specializing in the area of mergers, acquisition and corporate finance, to assist us with our initial marketing efforts in South America.
 
On May 15, 2015, the Company and Snotarator, L.L.C. extended the term of the Snotarator Distributor Agreement from May 15, 2015 to May 15, 2017 by mutual written agreement. The Snotarator Distributor Agreement related to the Snotarator and Snotaphant Nasal Aspirator products. Snotarator Nasal Aspirator and Snotaphant Nasal Aspirator are registered trademarks owned by Snotarator LLC, the use of which was granted to the Company pursuant to the terms of the distributor agreement.
 
On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Termination of Distributorship Agreement and Release with Snotarator LLC terminating the Snotarator Distributor Agreement. Also on December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Termination of HFG Consulting Agreement and Release with HFG terminating the HFG Consulting Agreement.
 
Reverse Acquisition of Tiger Trade
 
On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Tiger Trade Technologies, Inc. (“Tiger Trade”), a Texas corporation and the stockholders of Tiger Trade.  Under the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement, the Company offered and sold Seventeen Million Nine Hundred Thousand (17,900,000) newly issued shares of Company Common Stock and Five Million (5,000,000) newly issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Preferred Stock”) in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares of Tiger Trade capital stock. The effect of the issuance was that, upon closing of the Exchange Agreement transaction, former Tiger Trade stockholders held approximately 85.91% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock.

As a condition precedent to consummation of the Exchange Agreement, Orsolya Peresztegi, the Company’s sole officer and director on the closing date of the transaction, effected the cancellation of Seven Million Ninety-Five Thousand Six Hundred Two (7,095,602) shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a Cancellation Agreement effective as of the Exchange Agreement closing date. Under the terms of the Cancellation Agreement, Tiger Trade paid Ms. Peresztegi a cancellation fee of Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Dollars ($245,000).
 
As a result of the Exchange Agreement and Cancellation Agreement transactions described above, the Tiger Trade stockholders acquired as of the date the transaction closed, in the aggregate, approximately 88.64% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, and Tiger Trade became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Under the Exchange Agreement, (1) Orsolya Peresztegi, the Company’s sole officer on the closing date, resigned as an officer of the Company and Gust Kepler was appointed as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and (2) Mr. Kepler was appointed to serve as a director of the Company. Ms. Peresztegi subsequently resigned as a director of the Company effective January 4, 2016.
 
Merger of Tiger Trade into the Company 
 
On February 8, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Tiger Trade providing for the merger of Tiger Trade with and into the Company. At the effective time of the merger, the shares of Tiger Trade capital stock outstanding immediately before the effective time were canceled, retired and ceased to exist. The merger became effective February 9, 2016.
 
Name Change
 
The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation effective as of March 9, 2016 changing the name of the Company to Blackboxstocks Inc.
 
Overview of Business
 
The Company is in the business of developing, maintaining and marketing a real time analytical web based software as a service platform (the “Blackbox System”) that serves as web and mobile based tool for stock and option traders at all levels of experience evaluate prospective investments on various securities exchanges and markets. Our proprietary Blackbox System technology is an algorithm driven system that works in real time, measuring market trends and data while utilizing a multitude of specific criteria, both live and historical. Our servers, located in close proximity to the NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC exchanges drive our proprietary algorithms at near light speed. Our Blackbox System platform employs predictive technology enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that can result in the rapid change in a stock’s price. The Blackbox System was initially designed to monitor and analyze over 13,000 stocks on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC”), New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE MKT, LLC (formerly the American Stock Exchange) and NASDAQ markets simultaneously as our servers receive live data feeds from such markets. We have also customized our Blackbox System to analyze data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (“HKEX”), Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”) for license and use primarily in Asia. We consider the Blackbox System technology to be among the most user-friendly of its kind.
 
The Blackbox System employs predictive technology enhanced by artificial intelligence to identify volatility and unusual market activity that may result in rapd change in the price of a stock. The complexity of our backend analytics is neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to navigate dashboard which includes real-time alerts, scans, news and institutional grade analytics. Additionally, our users are provided a fully interactive chat and social media platform, integrated in our dashboard. This allows users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently. Recently, a live audio-video feature was introduced which allows our subscribers the ability to broadcast and share trade strategies and market insight, on their own channels within the Blackbox community.

The Blackbox System is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform, combining proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media, to connect traders of all types worldwide in our ultimate user-friendly system,
 
Development of the Blackbox System
 
Our former subsidiary, Tiger Trade, began the development of the Blackbox System. Though the system was made available for use to US subscribing customers in September 2016, the Company is still in the process of developing the Blackbox System and its features. The Company (and Tiger Trade) has incurred approximately $185,324 and $319,935 in software development costs and expenses in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In order to provide for costs associated with maintaining the Blackbox System, we expect to require approximately $87,500 over the next 12 months. In October of 2016 we began designing and testing a version of the Blackbox System intended to function with information on securities listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We are developing this new platform (“Asian Blackbox System”) with the intent of licensing this technology to be marketed to and used by customers in Asia. The Asian Blackbox System software is currently under development and we expect that it will be available for subscribers in late April 2017. We estimate the costs to be incurred in the development of the Asian Blackbox System to be approximately $37,500 over the next 12 months.
 
Marketing of the Blackbox System
 
The Company launched its Blackbox System web application for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the Blackbox System is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. Since launch, we have marketed our system to potential subscribers primarily via online and referral based marketing. Thus far we have achieved a majority of our subscriber base via our customer referral program. We have been offering certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers’ effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month a referred subscriber continues its subscription. We incurred $45,866 in customer referral expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2017. These equal approximately 11% of our subscription sales revenues generated in the year ended December 31, 2017. We intend to expand the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our future marketing efforts are expected to include, but will not be limited to, online affiliate marketing, banner advertising, social media, television and targeted email campaigns.
 
On August 9, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement (the “BBTR License”) with EIGH8T TECHNOLOGIES INC. (referred to in the agreementas “BBTR”), a British Virgin Island registered company, for the development, customization and license to use and sublicense a version of the Asian Blackbox System (known as the “BBTR System”) solely for use in connection with data from the HKEX, SSE and SZSE. The BBTR System was made available to BBTR on a trial basis beginning May 15, 2017 and launched for use by BBTR customers beginning on June 1, 2017. The terms of the BBTR License provided that BBTR pay the Company $1.4 million in royalties for the first 12-month period beginning on June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018, and an additional $3.6 million for the second 12-month period beginning June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019. On November 13, 2017, we terminated the BBTR License due to BBTR’s failure to make timely payment of license fees.
 
The Company is currently evaluating opportunities to engage with new strategic marketing partners to exploit the Asian Blackbox System in the Asian market focusing on Mainland China.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
The Company offers its subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of our Blackbox System or the services provided.
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the development of investment software tools and services and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of development and marketing operations are limited. We must compete for such resources with startups, major financial services companies and midsize competitors. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our current operating and financial resources are not adequate to preclude any significant disruption of our operations. 
 
We consider our platform unique and do not consider any trading tools or trading analytics software direct competitors of our Company. There are many trading tools on the current market often referred to as “scanners”, that provide features, functions and analytics similar to those of the Blackbox System. There are also many social media platforms that cater to stock traders that serve as real-time informational sources. However, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or “scanner” and a social media platform within the same “dashboard” allowing users to view the same real-time data in parallel. Our Blackbox System creates a unique community for traders that can all share the same information and analyze this information on an identical analytics in real-time. We also consider our system unique because our predictive algorithms automatically populate alerts for active stocks with high probability of short-term gains. In spite of these factors that differentiate us, there are three companies that we believe could be considered competitors due to some like features and retail price point: Trade Ideas, Madscan, and Wizetrade.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, the Company has three full-time employees, including Gust Kepler who serves as our sole director and our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Jeff Sharrock, who serves as Vice President of Operations and an administrative (non-officer) employee.
