Overview

Genasys is a global provider of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform, and protect people. Our unified platform receives information from a wide variety of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) inputs to collect real-time information on developing and active emergency situations. Genasys uses this information to create and disseminate alerts, warnings, notifications, and instructions through multiple channels before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations.
Background

Genasys entered the critical communications arena following the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, which led to the development of the Long Range Acoustic Device® (“LRAD®”), an Acoustic Hailing Device (“AHD”) capable of communicating to and determining the intent of potential threats from a safe distance. The Company’s LRAD systems broadcast audible alert tones and exceptionally intelligible voice messages in a focused 30° beam over long distances to specific targets. LRADs were quickly embraced by the U.S. Navy and then other domestic military branches, federal agencies, and police departments, and then throughout the world. By using long-range communication to better manage the escalation of force, LRAD represented a new solution for potentially dangerous or hostile situations.
 
With a device capable of broadcasting audible alerts and notifications with exceptional vocal clarity over long distances, Genasys engineers enhanced the Company's critical communications technology to innovate a new generation of mass notification speaker systems. Most legacy mass notification systems sound sirens, but have limited, if any, voice broadcast capability. Genasys' advanced mass notification systems feature the industry's highest Speech Intelligibility Index (STI), large directional and omni-directional broadcast coverage areas, and an array of options that enable the systems to continue operating when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.
 
Realizing that integrating software with the mass notification speakers would provide further technology options and additional functionality, Company engineers developed Genasys' Emergency Management (“GEM”) command-and-control software. In addition to remotely activating and controlling Genasys advanced speaker systems, which feature satellite connectivity and solar power options, GEM facilitates the dissemination of alerts, warnings, notifications, information and instructions through multiple channels, including location-based Short Message Service (“SMS”), Cell Broadcast Center (“CBC”) mobile push, text, email, social media, TV, radio, and digital displays. These systems are used by government emergency services, schools, universities, and businesses to send emergency information and instructions to people at risk before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats.
 
Today, the fastest most direct way to share vital information is often through cell phones and computers. In response to a world where communication methods are becoming increasingly digital and mobile, Genasys recently expanded its GEM platform to include multiple software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions. These solutions include Zonehaven® evacuation resources, Integrated Mass Notification System (“IMNS”) networks that feature advanced mass notification powered by GEM command-and-control software, and the Company's National Emergency Warning System (“NEWS”) solution, a software application that works with mobile carriers to send emergency communications to the public with no opt-in required. These SaaS solutions are capable of disseminating critical alerts and information through text message, email, voice call, push notification, social media, and other delivery methods.

Software Products 
 
GEM

Genasys Emergency Management (“GEM”) is Genasys’ SaaS product platform that includes GEM Public Safety, GEM Enterprise, Zonehaven and NEWS.
 
GEM Public Safety
 
GEM Public Safety is an interactive, cloud-based SaaS solution that enables State, Local and Education (“SLED”) customers to send critical information to at-risk individuals or groups when an emergency occurs. GEM acts as both a communications input and output, receiving information from state-of-the-art sensors and emergency services, and quickly relaying notifications, alerts, and instructions to at-risk populations and first responders. GEM customers can create and send critical, verified, and secure notifications and messages using emails, voice calls, text messages, panic buttons, desktop alerts, television, social media, and more. Additionally, Genasys is a certified provider of Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (“IPAWS”) notifications. IPAWS is the federal public notification platform for the United States, which GEM Software customers can use to deliver critical communications in multiple languages to specific populations.
 
GEM sends targeted messages based on geographic location, permitting relevant information and instructions to be sent to the appropriate populations. Auto-Discovery, an innovative GEM feature, locates and connects with anyone on a wired or wireless network in a fixed area with no opt-in required. When discovered, GEM Software anonymizes all recipient information and data. When an emergency occurs, these tools allow at-risk groups or individuals to be notified as quickly as possible without sacrificing their privacy.
 
In addition to disseminating alerts and notifications, GEM uses two-way communication tools, including polls and check-ins to receive feedback from targeted populations and first responders. With direct feedback, operators can survey the safety and status of at-risk individuals, learn of developments, update notifications and/or instructions in response to new information, and more.
 
GEM Public Safety Case Study
 
In fiscal 2022, cities and counties in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas selected GEM to help safeguard millions of residents during severe storms, tornadoes, wildfires, flooding, debris flows, tsunamis, active shooter incidents, epidemics, civil unrest, and other disasters and life safety threats.
 
GEM Enterprise 
 
GEM Enterprise empowers businesses and organizations to send critical communications to at-risk employees, contractors, visitors, or groups based on geographic location or team status.
 
Operated and controlled via a single dashboard that includes two-way polling, duress buttons, field check-ins and recipient locations, GEM Enterprise solutions integrate with data sources, including active directories, human resources, visitor management, and building control systems to find and deliver safety alerts and notifications to employees, staff, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors.
 
GEM provides full redundancy and high resilience in workforce safety and messaging during everyday duties and critical business events. GEM’s accountability and real-time situational awareness translates to effective communications that can be delivered via voice calls, SMS messages, emails, desktop alerts, WhatsApp, and other corporate communication channels anytime, anywhere.

GEM Enterprise Case Study
 
With 300 community centers across 13 states, a prominent nonprofit organization needed a way to coordinate its COVID-19 response. The pandemic’s continued growth meant that resources had to be optimized and directed to specific hot spots. Changing requirements and conditions caused by the pandemic highlighted the need for efficient information exchange with personnel and volunteers. To handle these challenges, the nonprofit implemented GEM to ensure critical communications were delivered quickly and reliably.
Zonehaven
 
Zonehaven is a multipronged SaaS application that serves both first responders and the jurisdictions they protect. Emergency services agencies can prepare for natural or man-made disasters by developing evacuation plans that map routes, shelters, traffic control locations, and road closures using Zonehaven's extensive public safety resources and mapped zones. This information is easily shared with the public and reduces the time it takes to execute emergency evacuations and conduct orderly repopulations.
 
When an incident occurs, it is immediately tracked by Zonehaven, which maps and simulates the speed and direction of the incident to determine which zones (geographic areas) are at risk and need to be evacuated. As an incident develops, Zonehaven provides real-time updates, helping to ensure emergency services personnel have the most up-to-date information. In turn, emergency services agencies use this information to augment evacuation plans and share critical information with at-risk individuals and populations through alerts, messages, and community-facing mapping applications. Notifications can be sent using Zonehaven and a variety of other channels, including local GIS departments and other agencies, traffic applications, including Waze, and more.
 
In addition to communicating to members of their own community, emergency services agencies can also use Zonehaven to communicate with neighboring towns, cities, and counties. Zonehaven’s network exists across jurisdictions to facilitate multi-agency collaboration and cooperation. By having access to the shared Zonehaven knowledgebase, emergency organizations can work together across jurisdictions to prepare plans, take responsive action, and coordinate evacuations and repopulations.
 
Zonehaven Case Study
 
Spurred by a geographic and environmental susceptibility to wildfires and recent conflagrations, first responders and emergency services agencies in 27 California counties have entered into multi-year Zonehaven software services and evacuation management contracts to better protect the more than 12 million residents they serve.
NEWS
 
The National Emergency Warning System (“NEWS”) provides multichannel public safety notifications and instructions to designated areas, groups, or agencies when a crisis occurs. The NEWS platform is cloud-based, geo-redundant, and end-to-end encrypted. NEWS is a SaaS product that requires mobile telecom services for installation and integration.
 
Genasys partners with mobile telecom networks to provide the channels to deliver NEWS SMS and CBC alerts and notifications that can be sent to anyone, anywhere, with no recipient opt-in, registration, or download required. By partnering with government and mobile telecom networks, NEWS provides precise geolocation capabilities (dynamic maps, traffic information, weather forecasts, and environmental sensor data) which allow NEWS operators to receive accurate information, send hyper-specific notifications, and monitor evacuation progress. NEWS can locate recipients and deliver messages in near real time, compared with other SMS alert providers that can take up to 15 minutes. Even with NEWS’ reach and scope, all data is anonymized, ensuring individuals stay safe and informed without sacrificing their privacy.
 
NEWS has an easy-to-use dashboard that can be controlled by operators through a cloud-based command console, or a mobile app. NEWS receives alerts and warnings from multiple sources, which then appear in the dashboard. Operators interpret this information and use it to create, activate, and broadcast notifications to the appropriate population via TCP/IP, satellite, Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM, fiber radio, text message, email, cell broadcast, social media, television, speakers, sirens, and more. NEWS has many capabilities and options, including smart messaging, integration with other communication channels, and geo-fencing. With access to numerous channels and partnerships with mobile carrier networks, NEWS helps ensure at-risk populations are alerted when a local, regional or national emergency occurs.

NEWS Case Study
 
In the aftermath of devastating bushfires that killed and injured hundreds of citizens and burned thousands of homes in 2009, Australia’s government decided to create a location-based public warning system that could reach more than 95% of the population affected by bushfires, flooding, severe storms, and other disasters.
 
Beginning in particularly susceptible areas and then expanding to cover the entire country, government officials worked with Genasys, major telecom providers, and other companies to develop a location-based SMS public warning system that met the government's public safety warning expectations and national authorities’ operational and functional system requirements. Since going live in 2013, NEWS has delivered more than 200 million location-based SMS emergency alerts to many of the country’s 25 million residents and 9 million annual visitors.
 
Hardware Products 
 
IMNS
 
The Integrated Mass Notification System (IMNS) product line unites Genasys next generation of mass notification speaker systems with GEM command-and-control software. Most legacy mass notification systems use sound sirens, but have limited, if any, voice broadcast capability. Genasys' advanced mass notification systems feature the industry's highest STI, large directional and omni-directional broadcast coverage areas, and an array of options that enable the systems to continue to operate when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.
 
IMNS gives operators the ability to send critical alerts and notifications from emergency operations centers, and authorized computers or smart phones. Emergency alerts and information can be sent via individual, grouped or networked IMNS installations, text messages, emails, IPAWS, desktop alerts, television, voice calls, and social media. IMNS' layered redundancy helps to ensure the maximum number of people receive critical communications.
 
IMNS Case Study
 
Faced with wildfires, flooding, debris flows, earthquakes, tsunamis, severe weather and other public safety threats, a California beach city selected IMNS to deliver emergency alerts and notifications to its 23,000 residents and 6 million annual visitors. 21 IMNS installations are in place throughout the city with more installations planned. The IMNS installations can be activated individually, in groups, or simultaneously to provide area specific or citywide emergency warning coverage. The IMNS outdoor speaker installations are equipped with solar power, battery backup, and satellite connectivity. In the event power and telecommunications infrastructure fails, alerts and notifications can also be sent via text messages, voice calls, and social media.
LRAD
 
The LRAD is the world’s leading AHD. Projecting alert tones and audible voice messages with exceptional vocal clarity in a 30° beam from close range to 5,500 meters. LRADs are used throughout the world in multiple applications and circumstances to safely hail, warn, inform, direct, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, establish large safety zones, resolve uncertain situations, and save lives. LRADs have been deployed on military vehicles, at corporate headquarters, in hostage negotiations, aboard private yachts, and in numerous other situations where clear and intelligible voice communications are essential.
 
Several LRAD models are available in varying audio output, communication coverage area, size, and functionality. Several options and accessories (cameras, searchlights, mounts, etc.) are also available to enhance LRAD capabilities.
 
All LRADs are defined by their unparalleled audio output and clarity. LRADs use Genasys' proprietary XL driver technology, which generates higher audio output in a smaller and lighter form factor. The technology also helps ensure voice messages and alert tones cut through background noise and are clearly heard and understood. These competitive advantages, and constant innovation, have made LRAD the de facto standard of the global AHD industry.
 
LRAD Case Study
 
SWAT teams respond to dangerous situations where communication is vital. Previously, SWAT teams used bullhorns and vehicle public address (“PA”) systems to communicate with violent suspects. Because of the poor intelligibility and limited broadcast range of bullhorns and vehicle PA systems, SWAT team members often had to closely engage with suspects, putting themselves, suspects, and bystanders in harm's way.
 
   5

  

Many SWAT teams now use LRAD for serving high risk warrants, during hostage and barricaded suspect negotiations, active shooter situations, and other SWAT operations. LRAD systems are portable and adaptable in most any situation to provide clear voice broadcasts over long distances. By effectively communicating from safe standoff distances, LRAD helps resolve uncertain situations, safeguards operators and protects the public.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Manufacturing
 
As an ISO 9001:2015 manufacturer, we believe maintaining quality manufacturing capacity is essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our technologies are different from mass-produced designs, and our manufacturing and assembly involves unique processes and materials. We contract with third-party suppliers to produce various components and sub-assemblies. In our facility, we complete the final assembly, test, and ship our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test, and qualify products. We continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field failures. We also perform third-party testing and certification of our products to ensure that they meet rigorous military and commercial specifications. We implement design and component changes periodically to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability. 
Suppliers
 
We minimize inventories and maximize the efficiency of our supply chain by having a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers mainly located within 50 miles of our facility. The Company relies on one supplier for compression drivers for its LRAD products and is working to obtain alternative suppliers to reduce such reliance. The Company’s ability to manufacture its products could be adversely affected if it were to lose this sole source supplier and was unable to find an alternative supplier. We also purchase several key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact that supply chain issues and economic conditions can have on such suppliers. The fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates could also impact our lead times and product costs. We have developed strong relationships with a number of our key suppliers. If these suppliers experience supply chain issues, quality problems or part shortages, our production schedules could be significantly delayed, or our costs could significantly increase. 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell products and services through our salesforce based in California, Colorado, Florida, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Canada, Singapore, Spain, and the U.A.E., as well as through a full-time business consultant in Germany. Our corporate and administrative offices are located in San Diego, California. 
 
We sell directly to governments, militaries, large end-users, and commercial companies. We use independent representatives on a commission basis to assist in our direct sales efforts. We also use a channel distribution model, in which we sell our products directly to independent resellers and system integrators around the world, who then sell our products (or our products integrated with other systems) to end-user customers. We are focusing our internal business development resources on building relationships with governments and other large direct customers. In addition, we utilize part-time consultants with expertise in various government and defense sectors to advise us on procedures and budgetary policies in an effort to be successful in these areas. 
 
We have a global reputation for providing high quality, innovative voice broadcast systems and mobile alert solutions that have made Genasys and LRAD internationally recognized product brands. We actively promote our brands and products through our website, trade shows, and advertising. We intend to increase the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain and believe growing brand awareness will assist in expanding our business. We believe our reputation for technological expertise, quality products, and strong service and support provide us competitive advantages.
 
Customer Concentration
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, one customer accounted for 68% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, one customer accounted for 58% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues.
 
Our revenues to date have relied on a few major customers. The loss of any customer could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We have made progress diversifying our revenues and expect to continue to do so in future periods.

Backlog
 
Our order backlog for products that are deliverable in the next 12 months was approximately $21.7 million as of September 30, 2022, compared with $36.0 million as of September 30, 2021. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Our backlog orders are supported by firm purchase orders. 
Warranties
 
We generally warrant our products to be free from material and workmanship defects for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally a limited warranty, and in some instances imposes certain shipping costs on the customer. We generally provide direct warranty service, but at times we may establish warranty service through third parties.
 
We also provide repair and maintenance agreements and extended warranty contracts at market rates, with terms ranging from one year to several years, as an additional source of revenue and to provide increased customer satisfaction.
 
Competition
 
Our technologies and products compete with those of other companies. Our LRAD AHDs and advanced mass notification speakers are part of the commercial and government audio industry and mass notification markets that are fragmented and include numerous manufacturers with products that vary widely in price, quality, and distribution channels. Present and potential competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to product development. We believe we compete primarily on the originality of our products, the uniqueness of our technology and designs, and our responsiveness to customers and the ability to meet their needs. We believe the quality, reliability and superior performance of our products, which have been developed by incorporating feedback from our customers and our desire to provide the highest quality products, also provide us competitive advantages.
 
Our LRAD product line includes the leading long-range voice broadcast systems for military and other applications. Our AHD competitors include Ultra Electronics/USSI, IML Sound Commander and others. We do not believe these competitors have achieved significant global market penetration in the AHD market to date. We believe our LRAD product line has demonstrated acceptance, has performed extremely well in harsh environments, and can continue to compete on the basis of technical features, performance, ease of use, quality and cost. As we continue to grow this market, future competitors may enter, which could impact our competitiveness. 
 
Our advanced mass notification speakers compete against several domestic and international companies, including Federal Signal, Whelen Engineering Company, Hoermann, and others. We believe our industry-leading voice intelligibility and area coverage, as well as our satellite connectivity and solar power options, provide key advantages that distinguish us from our competitors. When integrated with our GEM command-and-control software to provide multiple remote activation and control options, we believe our mass notification speakers are among the most technologically advanced and easiest to operate in the world.
 
In the more mature and established critical communications and event management markets, we compete against several competitors, including Everbridge, OnSolve, Rave Mobile Safety, and others. We believe our ability to unify sensors and IoT inputs with the multichannel, multiagency dissemination of geolocation-targeted alerts, notifications and instructions before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations, gives us significant competitive advantages against these established organizations. Our reliable, fast, and intuitive solution for sending warnings and information via location-based SMS, CBC, mobile push, text, email, social media, TV, radio, digital displays, sirens and speaker arrays, and our platform’s compatibility with major emergency warning protocols, including IPAWS, WEA, and others, provide additional competitive advantages. We believe the domestic and international markets for public safety, emergency warning, and critical communications are substantial and growing. 
 
Seasonality

Because our sales are primarily to domestic and international government departments or agencies, our selling cycles tend to be long and difficult to forecast. We have not experienced any significant seasonality trends to date, but we may experience increased seasonality in the future. 
Government Regulation

We are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. If we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected.

Our products are produced to comply with standard product safety requirements for sale in the U.S. and similar requirements for sale in Europe and Canada. We expect to meet the electrical and other regulatory requirements for electronic systems or components we sell throughout the world. 
 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

Financial information regarding our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 18, Segment Information, and Note 19, Major Customers, Suppliers and Related Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information
 
We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas, and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are important drivers of success. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual obligations. We pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing our intellectual property rights. 
 
In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise, and experienced personnel, we believe strong product offerings that are continually upgraded and enhanced will keep us competitive, and we seek patent protection on important technological improvements that we make. We have an ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products and technologies. Prior to the filing and granting of patents, our policy is to disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. Patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all-important claims and could be denied in their entirety. We also file for trade name and trademark protection when appropriate. We are the owner of several registered trademarks, many of which have earned worldwide brand recognition. 
 
Our policy is to enter into nondisclosure agreements with each employee and consultant or third party to whom any of our proprietary information is disclosed. These agreements prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to others, both during and subsequent to employment, or the duration of the working relationship. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information or provide adequate remedies for any breach. 
 
Research and Development
 
The software and sound reproduction markets are subject to rapid changes in technology and design with frequent improvements and new product introductions, as well as customized solutions for specific customer applications. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve existing technologies and to introduce new technologies and products on a competitive basis that meet the needs of our customers. Accordingly, we are continuing to invest in significant research and new product development activities. 
 
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we spent approximately $7.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development. Future levels of research and development expenditures will vary depending on the timing of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in other areas.

We recognize that our success is based on the collective talents and dedication of those we employ, and we are highly invested in their success.
 
COVID -19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we monitor the developments and assess areas where there is potential for our business to be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to manage it, including those by governmental authorities, have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the economy. Disruptions in the supply chain have affected our ability to source and the cost of certain materials for some of our hardware products. We have managed these supply disruptions by sourcing comparable materials or redesigning product modules using more readily available parts. While we do not currently anticipate a material reduction in demand for our commercialized products, we could experience a decrease in new orders, which could negatively impact our revenues and reduce our liquidity and cash flows. The financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that could impact our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing activities. We have $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022, which we believe provides sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, although liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could adversely impact our liquidity and warrant changes to our investment strategy. Any of the aforementioned circumstances, as well as other factors, may cause our results of operations to vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter.
