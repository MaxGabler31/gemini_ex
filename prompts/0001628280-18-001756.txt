Prompt: Summarize the business model from the following text. Answer with a continuous text and with fivehundredtwelve tokens at max. Set your focus on sources of revenue , the intended customer base , products , distribution channels  and details of financing. Use only information from the following the text:

Item 1.    Business.
Corporate Structure and Business
We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points. Consistent with our focus on management, franchising, and licensing, we own very few of our lodging properties. We were organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “Marriott International, Inc.”
We believe that our portfolio of brands, shown in the following table, is the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties of any lodging company in the world. 
We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and Asia Pacific. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Caribbean and Latin America operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments. We provide financial information by segment and geography in Footnote 14 “Property and Equipment” and Footnote 18 “Business Segments.”
Acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
On September 23, 2016 (the “Merger Date”), we completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC, formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”) through a series of transactions (the “Starwood Combination”), after which Starwood became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott. Our Financial Statements and related discussions in this report include Starwood’s results of operations only from the Merger Date through year-end 2017 and reflect the financial position of our combined company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, except where we specifically state otherwise, such as certain statistics described under the caption “Performance Measures” in Part II, Item 7. We refer to our business associated with brands that were in our portfolio before the Starwood Combination as “Legacy-Marriott” and to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.” See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.
Company-Operated Properties
At year-end 2017, we had 1,959 company-operated properties (554,642 rooms), which included properties under long-term management or lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”), properties that we own, and home and condominium communities for which we manage the related owners’ associations.
Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and 
 3

indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount. Many of our Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. Many of our Operating Agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies. In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.
For the lodging facilities we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing, and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services, and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs. 
Franchised, Licensed, and Unconsolidated Joint Venture Properties
We have franchising, licensing, and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems. Under our hotel franchising programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. We are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and, in some cases, own hotels. Some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels. We recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “Equity in earnings” caption of our Income Statements. Franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. 
We also receive royalty fees under license agreements with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (“MVW”), our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011, and Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (“Vistana”), a subsidiary of Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (“ILG”), which acquired Starwood’s vacation timeshare operations before the Merger Date. MVW is the worldwide developer, marketer, and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands. Vistana is the worldwide developer, marketer, seller, and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Westin and Sheraton brands, and under the St. Regis and The Luxury Collection brands for certain existing properties. We receive license fees from both MVW and Vistana consisting of a fixed annual fee, adjusted for inflation, plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes.
At year-end 2017, we had 4,432 franchised and licensed properties (685,365 rooms) and 129 unconsolidated joint venture properties (17,659 rooms).
Residential
We use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate, often in conjunction with hotel development, and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others. Third-party owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We have used or licensed our JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari, Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, and Autograph Collection brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales. While the worldwide residential market is very large, we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive.
Seasonality
In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable. Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.
Relationship with Major Customer 
We operate 84 properties that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Host”) under long-term management agreements. In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties that we operate under long-term management agreements. See Footnote 20 “Relationship with Major Customer” for more information.

Intellectual Property
We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services. We believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, care, service, and value to our customers, guests, and the traveling public. Accordingly, we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use.
Brand Portfolio
We believe that our brand portfolio offers the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties in hospitality, with two overall styles of hotels -- Classic, offering time-honored hospitality for the modern traveler, and Distinctive, offering memorable experiences with a unique perspective -- each of which we group into three quality tiers: Luxury, Premium, and Select. 
Luxury offers bespoke and superb amenities and services. Our Luxury hotel brands include: JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, and Bulgari.

Our Premium hotel brands include: Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance, Le Méridien, Autograph Collection, Delta Hotels, Gaylord Hotels, Marriott Executive Apartments, Marriott Vacation Club, Tribute Portfolio, and Design Hotels.

Our Select hotel brands include: Courtyard, Residence Inn, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Four Points, TownePlace Suites, Aloft, AC Hotels by Marriott, Protea Hotels, Element, and Moxy.

(1) | Excludes Design HotelsTM properties, which participate as partner hotels in the SPG loyalty program and are available for booking through our reservation channels.

Other Activities
Credit Card Programs. In the 2017 fourth quarter, we reached new multi-year agreements to amend our relationships with JP Morgan Chase and American Express for our U.S.-issued, co-brand credit cards associated with our guest loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest (“SPG”) (which we refer to collectively as our “Loyalty Programs”). At year-end 2017, we also licensed credit card programs in Canada, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Japan. We earn license fees based on card usage, and we believe that our co-brand credit cards have contributed to the success of our Loyalty Programs and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands.
Loyalty Programs, Sales and Marketing, and Reservation Systems. Our Loyalty Programs have 29 participating brands. MVW, Vistana, and other program partners also participate in one or more of our Loyalty Programs. The Loyalty Programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 49 participating airline programs. We believe that our Loyalty Programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2017, Loyalty Program members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights. While we continue to run our Loyalty Programs in parallel, we encourage the linking of accounts between the Loyalty Programs, allowing instant elite status match, and enabling the transfer of points between the programs. We continue to enhance our Loyalty Program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing guest base. Our loyalty member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts. See the “Loyalty Programs” caption in Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.
Marriott.com, Starwoodhotels.com, SPG.com, our international websites, and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2017. Our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our Loyalty Programs to book our exclusive Member Rates. Our Look No Further® Best Rate Guarantee ensures best rate integrity, strengthening consumer confidence in our brand, and gives guests greater access to the same rates when they book through our various direct channels. We also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of guests through our mobile guest services - check-in, check-out, service requests, mobile key, and more - across our hotel portfolio. In 2017, we introduced mobile check-in to all Legacy-Starwood hotels globally that did not already offer the service, and we greatly expanded the number of hotels across our portfolio that offered mobile key, enabling guests to use their mobile devices as a keycard for room entry and amenity access. We also introduced mobile food ordering at selected properties, enabling guests to order food and beverages on-demand from hotel outlets. Our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience, while elevating the service experience through mobile guest services and generating superior guest satisfaction and more memorable stays at our properties.

At year-end 2017, we operated 23 hotel reservation centers, eight in the U.S. and 15 in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own two of the U.S. facilities and either lease the others or share space with a company-operated property. While pricing is set by our hotels, our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective. Economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners and franchisees, and enhance our fee revenue.
We believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people, processes, and systems. Our above-property sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy, reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts. We also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems, many of which are proprietary, which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increasing efficiency and producing higher property-level revenue for hotels in our portfolio. Most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize web-based programs to effectively manage the rate set-up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. 
As we further discuss in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” later in this report, we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation, revenue management, and property management systems, in our Loyalty Programs, and in other aspects of our business. We also make certain technologies available to our guests. Keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position. Furthermore, the integrity and protection of customer, guest, employee, and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency.
Sustainability and Social Impact. Guided by our 2025 Sustainability and Social Impact Goals, as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. In 2017, we launched our new Sustainability and Social Impact Platform, Serve 360: Doing Good In Every Direction. The platform is built around four focus areas: Nurture Our World; Empower Through Opportunity; Sustainable Operations; and Welcome All and Advance Human Rights. Within each of these areas, we have identified a series of goals that we have embarked upon to show progress through 2025. Examples of these goals include commitments to volunteering, investments in our communities, reduction of our environmental impact, and human rights training. 
Global Design Division. Our Global Design division provides design, development, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts. Like third-party contractors, Global Design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties.
Competition 
We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. According to lodging industry data, there are over 1,100 lodging management companies in the U.S., including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels, operate hotels on behalf of third-party owners, and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria.
We also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, search engines such as Google and Bing, and online services including Airbnb and HomeAway that allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms. We compete against lodging operators and other competitors for guests in many areas, including brand recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, security, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points.
During the last recession, demand for hotel rooms declined significantly, particularly in 2009, and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience. While demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2017, cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse. We would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain guest loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, to help maintain or increase our market share.
Affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the U.S. lodging industry, and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests, owners, and franchisees. In 2017, approximately 71 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. In the franchising business, we face many competitors that have strong 
 9

brands and guest appeal, including Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hyatt, Wyndham, Accor, Choice, Carlson Rezidor, Best Western, La Quinta, and others.
Outside the U.S., branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers decline, international travel accelerates, and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.
Based on lodging industry data, we have an approximately 15 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the U.S. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems, and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands.
Properties that we operate, franchise, or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic refurbishment and replacement of furnishings, fixtures, and equipment. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties. Properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion.
Employee Relations 
At year-end 2017, we had approximately 177,000 employees, approximately 23,000 of whom were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
Environmental Compliance 
The properties we operate or develop are subject to national, regional, state or provincial, and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. Those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our operation and development of properties complies, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future.
Internet Address and Company SEC Filings
Our primary Internet address is Marriott.com. On the investor relations portion of our website, Marriott.com/investor, we provide a link to our electronic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports. We make all such filings available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
