Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODITTM, is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.
 
Our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the trea
tment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We submitted 
a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for AR101 to 
the FDA in December 2018. The FDA initiated review of the BLA for AR101 in January 2019, and we expect that the FDA will determine whether the BLA has been accepted for filing by the end of March 2019. The FDA has made an initial determination that AR101, as an allergenic product candidate, is exempt from the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA. We are not aware of any instances in which the BLA for a product candidate that has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation was reviewed by the FDA pursuant to processes and timelines not governed by PDUFA, and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to whether the AR101 BLA will receive an expedited review typically granted to product candidates with such designation.  However, we believe the FDA has had policies that pre-date and post-date PDUFA that would allow for expedited review of PDUFA-exempt applications, and we 
are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the review timeline for the AR101 BLA. If the Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101 does not result in an expedited review of the BLA for AR101, the BLA will likely be reviewed under a twelve-month target review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications as measured from the January 2019 start date.
 
Our initial target patient population for AR101 is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group with a diagnosed peanut allergy, which we estimate applied to approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018. We expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the first half of 2019. We maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if approved, currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.
 
We are in the process of developing formulations for additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy and have formulation and manufacturing activities ongoing for a product candidate designed to treat egg allergy, AR201. We are also exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019. In addition, we are also conducting research and development activities for potential CODIT product candidates targeting other food allergies, including cow’s milk allergy.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to build a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes proprietary therapies to improve the lives of food-allergic patients and their families. We intend to achieve this goal by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:

• | Complete development and obtain approval of AR101 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of peanut allergy: We submitted the AR101 BLA in the United States in December 2018 and intend to file a MAA, for AR101 in the European Union in the first half of 2019. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize AR101 in the United States and Europe through our own specialty field force: We own worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates. If AR101 is approved for the treatment of peanut allergy, we intend to commercialize it by developing a specialty field force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States as well as allergy-focused clinicians in the major European markets. We anticipate that this field force could also support the commercialization of additional CODIT product candidates, if approved.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the CODIT system to develop additional proprietary product candidates for the treatment of food allergies: Leveraging the expertise we have gained developing AR101, review of our IND application for a product candidate for the treatment of egg allergy, AR201, was completed by the FDA in February 2019. We expect to commence a randomized Phase 2 trial of AR201 in mid-2019.

AR101 Program Overview
 Peanut allergy is a life-threatening disease with no approved medical treatment options. Based on a 2014 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 40% to 50% of the people with peanut allergy in the United States are sensitive to an exposure of 100 mg or less of peanut protein, the equivalent of less than half of a peanut kernel (one peanut kernel typically contains approximately 250 mg to 300 mg of peanut protein). In addition, people with peanut allergy are often sensitive to as little as 10 mg of peanut protein. Strict dietary avoidance is hard to achieve and accidental exposure to food allergens is common, resulting in approximately 200,000 emergency room visits per year in the United States. The burden and anxiety for patients and their families is significant and a highly motivating force in seeking out therapy. There is a particularly high unmet need in young children who spend a significant portion of their day away at school where parental control is diminished and in adolescents who face peer pressure from their friends and classmates and may begin to engage in risk-taking behaviors. 
 Allergists have long used immunotherapy approaches to successfully treat patients with environmental allergies, and academic research supports the potential for extending immunotherapy approaches to treating patients with food allergy. Published studies have shown oral immunotherapy, or OIT, to be a potentially promising approach to desensitizing patients with peanut, milk, egg, tree nut and other food allergies. This approach involves gradual introduction of increasing amounts of food allergen by the oral route to reduce the immune response to that allergen, referred to as the dose escalation phase, and then daily ingestion of the target dose of allergen to continue immunomodulation at a fixed therapeutic dose. Historically, OIT has been practiced by a small number of allergists using their own “home-brew” allergen formulations and desensitization protocols; however, no OIT-based products have been approved for the treatment of food allergies to date thereby limiting the widespread adoption of this approach. With CODIT, we believe that we are the first company to undertake systematic and rigorous development of an OIT-based therapeutic approach to treat food allergies. We believe that our first product candidate developed with our CODIT approach, AR101 has the potential to fulfill the need for a consistent and scalable OIT-based approach to peanut allergy.
 In December 2015, we initiated our Phase 3 PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) clinical efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe. In the PALISADE trial, we measured subjects’ change in levels of sensitivity to peanut protein using a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, or DBPCFC, at the beginning and the end of the approximately 12 month treatment period. A DBPCFC is generally considered the “gold standard” method of measuring a patient’s sensitivity to peanuts or other foods. During the DBPCFC, subjects consume increasing amounts of a peanut protein until either the test is naturally concluded or until a dose-limiting reaction, typically moderate or severe, occurs at which point the subject is not permitted to proceed to the next step in the challenge and the test is halted. Patient demographics were generally balanced among patients ages 4-17 enrolled in the AR101 treatment arm as compared to those from the same age group enrolled in the placebo treatment arm. The primary endpoint in PALISADE was different in the U.S. and European portions of the trial.
 
We completed global enrollment of 554 patients between the ages 4 and 49 in November 2016 and we completed the study in December 2017. Efficacy results for the Intent-to-Treat, or ITT, group and for patients ages 4-17 who completed the AR101 treatment arm of the study, or Completers, are summarized in the charts below:

A total of 496 patients ages 4–17, from both arms (372 AR101 and 124 placebo), were evaluable for safety. There were no deaths or suspected, unexpected serious adverse reactions. In both arms, the incidence of serious adverse events, or SAEs was low. An SAE is an adverse event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death, and must be reported to the FDA. A total of 10 patients ages 4-17 experienced SAEs, none of which were considered life-threatening: nine of these patients were in the AR101 arm (2.4%) and one was in the placebo arm (0.8%). Of the nine AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 that experienced an SAE, five patients experienced mild or moderate SAEs. The other four AR101-treated patients experienced severe SAEs, which, for two of these patients, were not related to treatment (a concussion and a viral asthmatic exacerbation). Of the two AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 who experienced severe SAEs related to treatment, both of whom had elevated baseline peanut-specific IgE levels greater than 100 kU/L, one experienced anaphylaxis and the other experienced wheezing on the first day of treatment. Both of these patients discontinued from the study. Of patients ages 4-17, 12.4% of patients from the AR101 treatment arm and 2.4% of patients from the placebo-treatment arm discontinued due to investigator-reported adverse events.  
 In December 2017, we completed enrollment of 388 eligible patients who had completed the PALISADE trial into a related open-label roll-over trial, ARC004, which is ongoing  In January 2018, we completed enrollment of 506 patients in our RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) clinical trial.  In November 2018, we announced positive topline results from the RAMSES trial, which demonstrated that the safety profile was consistent with the safety profile of AR101 observed in PALISADE.  
  The safety summary for patients treated with AR101 in a controlled setting, the Controlled Population, submitted with the AR101 BLA included data on 709 patients treated with AR101 and 292 patients treated with placebo in clinical trials ARC003 (PALISADE), and ARC007 (RAMSES), as of the data cut-off date of July 15, 2018.
 In February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, 
 4

which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy Success) trial. Treatment of all patients in this trail is now complete and we expect to report preliminary summary data from the trial in the first half of 2019.  
 In Europe, we expect that data from PALISADE, ARC004 and ARTEMIS will form the basis for the MAA for AR101 filing, expected to be filed with the EMA in the first half of 2019. 
 Food Allergy Overview
 Food Allergies are a Significant and Growing Health Problem
 Food allergies are a significant and growing health problem in the United States, Europe and throughout the developed world. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, and one in 13 children are affected in the United States. According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2013, the economic cost of food allergies in the United States is estimated to equal approximately $25 billion per year, of which approximately $4 billion is associated with direct medical expenses. Food allergies are a particularly urgent issue for children and adolescents because of the greater prevalence of food allergies in those age groups and because of the increased risk of accidental exposures leading to a serious allergic reaction. A large-scale study conducted in 2011 concluded that approximately 8% of children and adolescents in the United States have a food allergy and that approximately 39% of that group had a history of at least one severe allergic reaction. We estimate that over 50% of patients with peanut allergy experience a severe allergic reaction each year.
 Peanut is the most common type of food allergy. Among children with food allergies in the United States, approximately 25% are allergic to peanuts, with other common food allergies being milk (21%), shellfish (17%), tree nut (13%, of which walnut represents 40%)) and egg (10%). We estimate that there are approximately three million people in the United States and three million people in Europe with peanut allergy, including over three million children. The prevalence of peanut allergy in children in the United States is estimated to have increased at a constant annual growth rate of approximately 10% between 1997 and 2008, and experts believe it has continued to rise since 2008.
 Risks Associated with Allergic Reactions
 Allergic reactions to food are painful, frightening and potentially deadly. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include hives, swelling, vomiting, abdominal pain, wheezing, breathlessness, and lowered blood pressure. Severe and potentially life-threatening reactions are referred to as anaphylaxis and such reactions require urgent medical attention and often result in treatment at hospital emergency departments. Food-related allergic reactions are estimated to result in approximately 200,000 emergency room visits and over 10,000 hospital admissions each year in the United States.
 Allergic reactions, including severe allergic reactions, can be triggered by exposure to minute quantities of the relevant food allergen. For example, of the over two million people with peanut allergy in the United States, 40% to 50% are sensitive to an exposure of 100 mg or less of peanut protein, the equivalent of less than half of a peanut kernel (one peanut kernel typically contains approximately 250 mg to 300 mg of peanut protein). In addition, people with peanut allergy are often sensitive to as little as 10 mg of peanut protein, the equivalent of approximately 1/25th of a peanut kernel. As a result, accidental exposure arising from contamination of a food source or the inaccurate or confusing labeling of food products occurs regularly and can result in severe allergic reactions.
 Causes of Allergic Reactions
 Food allergies occur when the immune system responds to a harmless food as if it were a threat. The human gastrointestinal tract contains immune cells whose purpose is to identify and mount a response against proteins deemed to be foreign and unsafe. These cells come into contact with a large amount and variety of food proteins. In a non-allergic person, a tolerance for food proteins develops early in life, and the immune cells do not mount a response when food proteins are detected. In contrast, in an allergic patient, the immune system is sensitized to one or more food proteins, or allergens. As a result of this sensitization, the immune system produces antibodies, known as IgE antibodies, which are directed against a particular allergen, such as a specific peanut protein. The IgE antibodies link with mast cells and basophils, which are other immune cells. When an IgE antibody linked to these immune cells encounters the allergen it is directed against, the immune cells are activated and release histamine and other inflammatory mediators into the blood. These mediators then provoke the symptoms of an allergic reaction.
 The development and progression of food allergies is highly variable. It is unknown why some people develop food allergies while others do not. For certain types of allergies, such as milk and egg, patients may outgrow their allergies, but for others, such as peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish, most patients remain allergic for life. In addition, a person’s sensitivity appears to vary over time based on a range of factors. It is not unusual for a person’s first allergic reaction to be mild and their second allergic reaction to be severe or life-threatening.

Challenges in the Current Treatment and Management of Food Allergies
 There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. The most common practices are strict avoidance of food allergens and emergency treatment of allergy symptoms in the event of an accidental exposure. These options have substantial limitations, and the burdens of practicing avoidance and stress caused by the limited availability of effective treatment options for accidental exposure can have a substantial negative impact on the quality of life of food-allergic patients and their families. For example, food-allergic patients and their caregivers often have difficulties managing their social and day-to-day lives and live with an ongoing fear of accidental exposure and anaphylaxis. One study found that children with peanut allergy reported a poorer quality of life than children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A separate study found that the parents of peanut-allergic children reported more disruption in their family’s lives than the parents of children with rheumatological disease.
 Limitations of Practicing Avoidance of Food Allergens
 Successfully practicing avoidance can be very difficult and requires careful reading of food labels, care in the storage and preparation of foods, awareness of product recalls for mislabeling and contamination, and oftentimes avoidance of cuisines where the food allergen is known to be common. In addition, activities such as attending a sporting event, traveling by airplane or visiting public spaces become difficult and stressful for food-allergic patients and their families. Practicing avoidance can be particularly difficult on food-allergic children as parents often attempt to prevent accidental exposures by limiting their child’s participation in everyday activities, including social activities, eating outside the home and sometimes even choosing to home school their child because such food-allergic children may not have the awareness or self-regulation skills to practice avoidance by themselves. As children move into adolescence and young adulthood, decreased parental supervision and increased societal pressures often complicate the practice of avoidance.
Limitations of Emergency and Symptomatic Treatments
 Due to a lack of approved symptomatic or disease-modifying food allergy treatments, food-allergic patients typically must carry rescue medication to treat severe and possibly life-threatening allergic reactions. The most widely used treatment is epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), which is administered using an auto-injector, such as an EpiPen. Epinephrine blunts certain symptoms of the allergic reaction by increasing heart rate and blood pressure and dilating airways, but it does not treat the allergic reaction itself. While epinephrine is useful as a rescue medication, it is not always administered properly or quickly enough and may not be sufficient to counteract the effects of the allergic reaction.
Limitations of Current Desensitization Treatments
 Emergency and symptomatic remedies are reactive treatments and often ineffective in the chronic management of food allergies. The most commonly practiced proactive therapy for food and other allergies is desensitization therapy. Desensitization therapy consists of repeated administrations of increasing quantities of an allergen to an allergic patient in order to decrease the immune response to that allergen. The most common form of desensitization therapy is subcutaneous injections for patients with environmental allergies. While desensitization therapy has had significant success in the treatment of environmental allergies, it has been less successful in the treatment of food allergies. Four different desensitization therapy approaches to food allergies have been researched:

• | Subcutaneous Injections: Involves the subcutaneous injection of the food allergen. This approach has been shown to induce desensitization in some patients but has had an unacceptably high incidence of adverse events and research on this approach has largely been abandoned.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sublingual Immunotherapy: Involves the administration of increasing amounts of food extract under a patient’s tongue. This approach has been shown to be safe, but it appears to induce only a modest degree of desensitization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Epicutaneous Desensitization: Involves the use of a patch that causes allergens to be absorbed by the skin. Clinical trials are ongoing to explore the potential viability of this approach.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral Immunotherapy: Involves the administration of increasing doses of a food-based product on a daily basis over a period of months. This approach has the potential to produce a high degree of desensitization, but adoption has been hampered by lack of standardization for products and protocols.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the most effective form of desensitization therapy is oral immunotherapy, or OIT.
 Immunology of Oral Desensitization
 Oral desensitization works by gradually shifting the balance of the immune system to dampen the allergic response in the case of accidental exposure.
 6

The initial step in an immune response is the presentation of an allergenic protein by an antigen presenting cell, such as a dendritic cell, and subsequent recognition of the allergenic protein by T-cells. A subset of T-cells, known as Th2 cells, upon binding to an antigen secrete a set of pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which are important in cellular activation and signaling. Secretion of this group of cytokines promotes B-cell maturation and production of IgE antibodies. These IgE antibodies cross-link at the surface of the mast cells by binding with the antigen, which results in the mast cells releasing histamines, proteases and other chemical mediators of inflammation, all of which elicit symptoms of an allergic reaction.
 In oral desensitization, the step-wise increasing of doses of an allergen, starting with very low levels of such allergen that are generally insufficient to trigger a large IgE-mediated allergic reaction, has been shown over time to induce regulatory T-cells. These regulatory T-cells dampen the Th2 immune response. At the same time, the increasing levels of allergen exposure induce B-cells to produce IgG4 antibodies, which compete with IgE antibodies to bind with the allergen, thereby decreasing allergen-induced mast cell degranulation. Ultimately, these immunomodulatory T-cell and B-cell responses result in a decreased clinical response to allergen exposure. To realize the full potential of OIT, patients may need to stay on therapy for several years.
 Oral Desensitization in Practice
 In an OIT treatment regimen, the initial administration of a particular dose of the food allergen will typically be provided in an allergist’s office and the subsequent administrations will be done at home. The highest level of dosing administration will vary depending on the patient and the protocol, but generally the goal is to achieve desensitization to a level of food allergen greater than the amount a patient might be exposed to in an accidental exposure. Once the highest dosing level is attained, the patient will continue to be administered a fixed dose on a regular basis. Over time, this regular administration has been shown to result in the patient being able to tolerate an amount of food substantially greater than the fixed dose.
 Prior to the development of AR101, numerous clinical trials at leading academic research centers had shown that OIT can desensitize patients to a range of food allergies, including peanut, egg, tree nuts and milk. While OIT generally does not cure a patient of his or her allergy, it can provide protection from food allergens at a level that exceeds the amount typically encountered in an accidental exposure. For many patients, this protection meaningfully decreases their stress and anxiety and enables them to lead a more normal life. However, while OIT has been observed to protect patients from allergic reactions in clinical trials, it has not yet been widely adopted and is currently available only from a limited number of academic research centers and specialized allergy clinics. In addition, because no OIT protocol or product has been validated in a large-scale clinical trial or approved by the FDA, the treatment regimen and food source used in OIT treatment is determined by the allergist based on their experience and review of the scientific literature, which can lead to varying results. While studies have shown that most patients tolerate OIT well, the incidence of severe adverse events associated with OIT treatment has historically been high enough to raise concerns in the medical community that it is not safe enough to be a standard part of an allergist’s practice. We believe these safety concerns along with complexity and lack of standardization have limited the adoption of OIT by community-based allergists. 
Our Solution
 Our CODIT approach for the treatment of food allergies leverages and improves upon the extensive independent scientific research supporting OIT. Based on our clinical development to date, including our Phase 3 PALISADE trial of our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, we believe that our CODIT approach has the potential to be widely adopted by allergists and to appeal to patients and parents as a result of the following key anticipated attributes:

• | Standardized Products: Our proprietary biologic product candidates are derived from natural food products and are designed to contain precisely defined dosages of well-characterized food proteins so that each dosage is consistent for total protein and relative allergen content. In addition, we expect each of our product candidates, if approved, to be provided to patients as a convenient, orally administered, once daily therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-Defined Treatment Regimens to Support Safety and Efficacy: We expect each CODIT product candidate to feature clearly defined clinical protocols with gradual dose escalation and practical fixed therapeutic dosing regimens designed to enhance safety, tolerability and efficacy. We intend to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each CODIT product candidate in large scale, well-controlled clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinically Meaningful Desensitization: We expect each approved CODIT product candidate to provide patients with protection from food allergens at a level that exceeds the amount typically encountered in an accidental exposure, to impart real world safety.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with Clinical Practice: We expect our protocols for each CODIT product candidate to be similar to treatment regimens currently utilized by allergists for non-food allergies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tailored Support Services: We intend to provide physician education, patient guidance and other support services to facilitate the administration of each approved CODIT product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory Approval: We believe regulatory approval of our CODIT product candidates, if obtained, will validate the extensive existing scientific research supporting oral desensitization and could lead to widespread adoption of CODIT.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our CODIT approach and product candidates, if approved, have the potential to reduce the dangers posed to food-allergic patients, such as accidental exposures resulting in anaphylactic reactions, emergency room visits or hospitalization. We expect that this potential protection from accidental exposures will reduce the stress and anxiety of patients and their families and enable patients to live more normal lives.
 AR101 for Peanut Allergy
 Overview
 We are developing our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, for the treatment of peanut allergy. Our initial target patient population is children and adolescents ages 4-17 years. AR101 is intended to desensitize patients to a level of peanut protein that substantially exceeds the amount typically encountered in an accidental exposure. Patients successfully treated with AR101 will still need to avoid the consumption of peanuts and foods containing peanuts, but we believe that protection against potential allergic reactions to accidental exposure will significantly improve the lives of food-allergic patients and their families.
 We believe AR101, if approved, will provide allergists with a safe and practical means of providing oral desensitization treatment to their patients with peanut allergy. AR101 is designed to be taken orally once daily after having been mixed with a common age-appropriate food. As with OIT, patients would start with a very low dose of AR101 and gradually increase their dose over time. The initial assessment of patients and each initial increase in dosage would occur at an allergist’s office. Based on our existing clinical data, we anticipate it will take patients approximately six months to reach a daily dose level of 300 mg of peanut protein. Patients would then continue on a daily 300 mg fixed dose, or the Therapeutic Dose. Based on independent scientific research, we anticipate that with continued therapeutic dosing, patients’ level of desensitization will increase over time. In order to maintain desensitization, patients would need to continue to take a daily Therapeutic Dose; however, based on experience with OIT, we do not believe that the occasional failure to take the Therapeutic Dose will significantly affect desensitization.
 Our dose escalation and therapeutic dosing regimens are set forth below:



For patients in the dose escalation phase of the AR101 treatment regimen, AR101 would be provided in a series of color coded pharmaceutical grade capsules of various dose levels. These capsules can be easily opened and emptied, with the contents then mixed with food. For patients who have reached the 300 mg Therapeutic Dose level, AR101 would be provided in an easy to open-and-empty sachet.

AR101 Product Characteristics
 We believe the following characteristics of AR101 could enable it, if approved, to achieve widespread market acceptance and distinguish it from existing treatments and potentially competing products in development:

• | Proprietary Biologic Product: Our proprietary formulation is a complex mixture of a full range of naturally occurring proteins and pharmaceutical-grade ingredients that we developed to enable the convenient dosing of consistent amounts of peanut protein with well-defined relative concentrations of peanut specific allergens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for Clinically Meaningful and Reliable Desensitization: Based on the results of our clinical trials of AR101, we believe that patients who successfully complete the AR101 dose escalation regimen will be desensitized to a level of peanut protein that substantially exceeds the amount typically found in a peanut-contaminated food product, which we believe ranges from as little as a fraction of a peanut to as much as a single peanut (which typically contains between 250 mg and 300 mg of peanut protein). In addition, even if such patients have an allergic reaction, based on the results of our clinical trials of AR101, treatment with AR101 is associated with fewer and less severe reactions to accidental peanut exposures as well as increases in the amount of peanut tolerated with additional time on the AR101 300mg daily dose. Our clinical trials of AR101 and independent scientific research have indicated that clinically meaningful desensitization can be attained through an OIT treatment regimen, independent of sex, age and other demographics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for Rapid and Predictable Onset of Action: In our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of AR101, a clinically meaningful level of protection was achieved by most patients in the AR101 treatment group after as few as 22 weeks of dosing. Independent scientific research has also shown that continued maintenance dosing pursuant to an OIT treatment regimen can confer increased protection over time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attractive Safety Profile Observed in Clinical Trials: In our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of AR101, most patients experienced only mild, intermittent side effects commonly associated with food allergies during the dose escalation phase of treatment. The most frequent of these side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms ranging from itching of the lips to vomiting, hives, throat itching or discomfort, and nasal congestion. We believe that many of these side effects are associated with the increases in dosage amounts during the initial dose escalation phase of the treatment regimen. Once patients are desensitized and on Therapeutic Dose, we believe that they are likely to experience fewer side effects. This is especially believed to be true after the first approximately one year on therapy during which levels of psIgE tend to be elevated (the HIgE phase).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient Oral Administration: AR101 is designed to be provided to patients as a convenient, orally administered, once daily therapy that is mixed with common age-appropriate foods. Compared to subcutaneous, epicutaneous or sublingual administration, we believe our CODIT approach represents a more convenient and practical method of dosing, particularly in young patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct, Targeted Route of Administration: Oral administration of AR101 is designed to enable the allergen to interact directly with immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract responsible for mediating the allergic reaction to peanuts. Oral desensitization is believed to work by gradually shifting the balance of the immune system to dampen the allergic response in the case of accidental exposure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with Current Clinical Practice and Infrastructure: The AR101 dose escalation regimen involves a series of visits to an allergist. This process is similar in many ways to existing regimens for the treatment of non-food allergies, such as pollen and pet dander, which we believe will facilitate adoption by allergists and reimbursement by payors if AR101 is approved.

AR101 Clinical Development Program 
 Our development of AR101 leveraged the substantial pre-existing independent scientific research on peanut allergy and OIT. In connection with our IND submission, we licensed data from studies conducted at three leading academic research institutions that demonstrated the potential of using OIT to desensitize peanut allergic patients. We have also leveraged academic studies that have shown that the daily administration of a relatively low Therapeutic Dose can enable patients to attain and sustain a significant degree of desensitization. 
 Our clinical trial designs were developed following a review of the academic study protocols described above as well as protocols used in clinical practice. Many of the protocols used in clinical practice have maximum dose levels of several thousand milligrams of peanut protein and use aggressive dose-escalation rates to reach the maximum dose levels quickly. We believe that, as a result, patients under these protocols sometimes receive too much peanut protein too soon and consequently suffer anaphylaxis, contributing to the perception that OIT is not safe. In designing our clinical trials, we incorporated low initial dose levels, a gradual escalation of the dosing and much lower Therapeutic Dose levels. We believe this approach provides for an improved protocol and has the potential to enable patients to safely attain a clinically significant level of desensitization in a reasonable time frame.

We also believe that a successful oral desensitization treatment regimen requires a well-characterized and precisely manufactured drug product. Independent scientific research has shown that the quantity of peanut protein and the relative concentrations of key peanut proteins can vary widely between the different commercially available peanut products that could potentially be used as a source for oral desensitization therapy. These variations could significantly impact the reliability and safety of an oral desensitization treatment regimen. In order to reduce the potential for variability, we chose to use peanut flour solely from the Golden Peanut Company, or GPC, as the basis for AR101. In order to develop AR101 as an FDA-approvable biological product, we took the further step of characterizing the protein signature of GPC flour. Independent scientific research has identified numerous peanut proteins that are the allergens that cause allergic reactions to peanuts. Three of these proteins appear to be the most significant and representative of the levels of the other proteins. Our characterization of AR101 is based on measuring total protein amount and the concentrations of those three key proteins, as a proxy for the full range of allergenic proteins contained in AR101.
 AR101 Phase 3 Development Program
 We have developed AR101 in close consultation with the FDA and European regulatory authorities, including the EMA. In September 2014, the FDA granted AR101 Fast-Track designation for OIT of peanut sensitive adults and children and in June 2015, the FDA granted AR101 Breakthrough Therapy designation for OIT of peanut sensitive children and adolescents (ages 4 - 17). Sponsors of products under development with a Fast-Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation may have greater interactions with the FDA, including the involvement of more senior staff members, among other benefits intended to expedite the development and review of the product candidate. A product that receives these designations may be eligible for accelerated approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met.  See “–Government Regulation—Government Regulation in the United States–Expedited Review and Approval Programs” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The regulatory approval process is lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and we may experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approval of AR101, which would delay the commercialization of AR101, adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, and harm our business and our results of operations.”
 We have had ongoing communications and meetings with the FDA relating to the clinical development of AR101 and its manufacture, including our most recent pre-BLA meeting in September 2018. We have had several country level scientific advice meetings with European regulatory authorities and our Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, for AR101 has been approved by the EMA.
 PALISADE Trial Design
 In December 2015, we initiated the Phase 3 PALISADE trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AR101 for the treatment of peanut allergy in children and adults, which was expected to enroll approximately 500 patients between the ages of 4 and 55 in North America and Europe. The study protocol is largely a combination of the protocols for ARC001 and ARC002. Patients are randomized at a three to one ratio between the AR101 group and a placebo group. Patients are up-dosed to a daily 300 mg dose over a period of five to six months and then maintained at that dose level for approximately six months. At the end of the maintenance period, patients are administered a DBPCFC. 
 Based on the feedback from the FDA relating to the description of results of the DBPCFC, we decided to report the single highest tolerated dose in the food challenge as an appropriate and clinically meaningful measure of the results. The primary endpoint in PALISADE was different in the U.S. and European portions of the trial. In the United States, the primary efficacy endpoint was the single highest tolerated dose of 600 mg, which corresponds to a cumulative amount of 1,043 mg of peanut protein. In addition, we were required to show superiority of AR101 over placebo with a 15% margin. In Europe, the primary efficacy endpoint was the single highest tolerated dose of 1,000 mg, which corresponds to a cumulative amount of 2,043 mg peanut protein, and we were not required to show superiority of AR101 over placebo with a 15% margin. Following discussions with the FDA and the EMA in the first half of 2017, we decided to conduct the primary efficacy analysis for the PALISADE trial in the 4-17 age group, in which we enrolled and treated 496 patients, or 90%, of the total number of patients enrolled in the PALISADE trial. We conducted separate analyses on the adults enrolled in the study
 PALISADE Trial Results
 
We completed global enrollment of 554 patients between the ages of 4 and 49 in November 2016 and completed the final study for the PALISADE trial in December 2017. Per the statistical analysis plan, the primary endpoint assessments were conducted by an independent assessor who was not involved in the patient’s ongoing care in the trial and was blinded to treatment assignment and food challenge sequence.

In the PALISADE trial, patient demographics were generally balanced among patients ages 4-17 enrolled in the AR101 treatment arm as compared to patients ages 4-17 enrolled in the placebo treatment arm, as summarized in the baseline patient characteristic table below.

 *  Intra-quartile range, 25th and 75th percentile
** Single highest tolerated dose in the entry DBPCFC
 
After approximately one year of treatment, in the DBPCFC exit challenge, 67.2% of AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 tolerated a single highest dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (1,043 mg cumulative) with no more than mild symptoms, compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients ages 4-17, corresponding to a difference in response rates of 63.2% (p<0.00001, 95% CI=53.0–73.3%). At 53%, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval significantly exceeded the prespecified success criterion for the study, which was 15%. Additionally, 50.3% of AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 tolerated a single highest dose of 1,000 mg of peanut protein (2,043 mg cumulative) compared to 2.4% of placebo patients (p<0.00001).
 
ITT Efficacy: Percent of Patients (Ages 4-17 years) Tolerating Each Dose in Exit DBPCFC
 
 
 | 300 mg | 600 mg | 1000 mg 
AR101 (n=372) | 76.6% | 67.2% | 50.3% 
Placebo (n=124) | 8.1% | 4.0% | 2.4% 
95% CI Difference | (58.6-78.5%) | (53.0-73.3%) | (38.0-57.7%)
p-value | p<0.00001 | p<0.00001 | p<0.00001 

 
Of patients ages 4–17, 296 patients (79.6%) on the AR101 treatment arm completed the trial, compared to 115 patients (92.7%) on the placebo arm. Of patients ages 4-17 who completed the AR101 treatment arm of the study, 96.3% tolerated at least 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein in the exit DBPCFC, 84.5% tolerated at least 600 mg (1,043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein, and 63.2% tolerated 1,000 mg (2,043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein. Additionally, AR101 significantly reduced symptom severity at each exit DBPCFC dose level, compared to placebo. 
 
PALISADE enrolled a highly sensitive and allergic patient population, and enrollment was balanced for baseline disease characteristics between the two treatment arms. The study enrolled patients who at baseline tolerated not more than 30 mg of peanut protein, and the patients ages 4-17, 72.2% had a past medical history of anaphylaxis and 52.8% of whom had a present or previous diagnosis of asthma. In addition, 65.5% of patients ages 4-17 reported multiple food allergies.  
 11

ARC004 Trial
 In December 2016, we began enrolling eligible patients who had completed PALISADE into a related open-label roll-over trial, which we refer to as the ARC004 trial. The ARC004 trial is designed to test the durability of AR101 treatment response and dose forgiveness in a multi-arm design to inform the potential for reduced frequency of dosing during the continued immunomodulation phase of AR101 therapy. Patients who have completed PALISADE are provided the opportunity to roll over into the ARC004 trial. Patients who were in the AR101 treatment arm in PALISADE will continue to receive AR101 in ARC004. Patients who were in the placebo arm of PALISADE will undergo dose escalation with AR101 in ARC004 and then continue therapy at the daily Therapeutic Dose of AR101. Enrollment in ARC004 was completed in December 2017. In total, 388 of the 441 patients who completed PALISADE enrolled in the ARC004 trial.
 RAMSES Trial
 In May 2017, we began enrolling patients in our real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial.  We completed enrollment in the RAMSES trial in September 2018. The safety profile observed in RAMSES was consistent with the safety profile of AR101 observed in PALISADE. RAMSES was a randomized 2:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 506 patients in the U.S. and Canada. The RAMSES trial did not require an oral food challenge for entry. Instead, patients were selected based on stringent entry criteria, including a well-documented medical history of IgE-mediated reactions to peanut (including anaphylaxis), skin prick test reactivity, and assessment of peanut-specific IgE levels. The study monitored treatment-emergent adverse events during a six-month dose escalation period. Patients were then be followed in an open-label manner for at least six months on the daily Therapeutic Dose of AR101.
 
POSEIDON Trial
 In December 2018, we initiated an international, randomized 2:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AR101 in peanut-allergic children ages 1–3 years in five countries in North America and Europe, which we refer to as POSEIDON (Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study of Early Intervention for Desensitization). 
 
Controlled Population Safety Summary
 The controlled population safety summary, submitted with our BLA for AR101 in December 2018 included data on 709 patients treated with AR101 and 292 patients treated with placebo in clinical trials ARC003 (PALISADE) and ARC007 (RAMSES) as of the data cut-off date of July 15, 2018.  Among these 709 patients, approximately 80% completed the dose escalation phase of the trial and 0.6% experienced anaphylaxis.  In addition, one patient (0.3%) experienced anaphylaxis during the Therapeutic Dose period of study ARC003. We have observed no cases of anaphylaxis following 52 weeks or more of treatment with AR101 at the Therapeutic Dose.  In addition, 0.4% of AR101-treated patients were diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE.          
 
In the controlled population, the majority of subjects who discontinued therapy did so during dose escalation (11.3%) compared all 300 mg/day dosing (1.3%). Among placebo-treated patients, 2.4% discontinued due to adverse events during dose escalation and none discontinued during the fixed-dosing part of the study The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product during dose escalation were gastro-intestinal disorders (7.8%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, including throat irritation (2.5%), and immune system disorders (systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis) (1.6%). 
 Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product are summarized by system organ class for the Controlled Population in the table below.

At each level of summarization (any event, system organ class, and preferred term), subjects with more than 1 adverse event leading to discontinuation of study product were counted only once within each study period. Initial Dose Escalation, or IDE. 

 In an exploratory analysis, 55 patients (41 AR101-treated and 14 placebo) between 18 and 49 years old were randomized into the study.  Twenty-one AR101-treated patients discontinued treatment, seven due to adverse events. Among adults who completed the study, 85% of AR101-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients tolerated 600 mg in the exit food challenge. While the majority of adults who completed the PALISADE trial in the AR101 arm successfully tolerated the 600 mg dosage (85%), the percentage of dropouts in the 18-49 age range was substantially higher than in our 4-17 year old study population thereby reducing the number of our ITT population in the 18-49 year old age range who successfully completed the DBPCFC. As a result, in the exploratory subpopulation ages 18-49, the ITT analysis did not show statistical significance at the 600 mg dose level. 
 Statistical significance is denoted by reference to the p-values in the Primary Endpoint and Additional Endpoints. The p-value is a measure that states the probability that a comparable or better result would be produced purely by chance. A p-value <0.00001 in the chart means that if the drug was only as effective as the placebo, there would be less than a 0.01% chance that a comparable or better result would be produced purely by chance. A p-value ≤0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance. When evaluating the potential efficacy of a drug product, the FDA reviews a statistical analysis to determine whether the results of the clinical trial demonstrated that the drug product was efficacious, and a showing of statistical significance in favor of the tested criterion supports the finding of efficacy.

ARTEMIS Trial
 In July 2017, we began enrolling patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar in the same age group, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring oral Immunotherapy Success) trial. ARTEMIS, a randomized 3:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in peanut-allergic children and adolescents ages 4-17 in Europe, will explore protection at an endpoint of tolerating a single dose of 1,000 mg of peanut protein (corresponding to a cumulative of 2,043 mg peanut protein) after nine months of treatment. The inclusion criteria for the trial will require that patients react at or before the 300 mg dose of the challenge. Patients will undergo approximately six months of dose escalation and then three months of the daily Therapeutic Dosing of AR101, followed by an exit DBPCFC. ARTEMIS builds on the observation that a very high proportion of patients in the ARC002 Phase 2 trial of AR101 were desensitized to a single dose of 1,000 mg of peanut protein at the nine-month endpoint. ARTEMIS is designed to confirm that finding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled setting. In February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in ARTEMIS, and we expect data from the ARTEMIS trial in the first quarter of 2019.  We believe that ARTEMIS will help to enhance our knowledge about the timing and extent of desensitization offered by AR101 treatment. As we have engaged with more stakeholders across Europe, we have also come to understand that confirming that a higher efficacy level can be reached sooner would be important in obtaining labeling for protection against accidental exposure and supporting reimbursement applications for AR101, especially as we see increased focus on cost effectiveness throughout Europe.
 We expect to file an MAA in the first half of 2019 and will include data from PALISADE, ARC004, RAMSES and ARTEMIS in such filing. 
 ARC005 Trial
 Pursuant to our Pediatric Investigation Plan, we initiated a study of AR101, in peanut allergic patients ages 12 to 48 months in the fourth quarter of 2018 which we refer to as ARC005.
ARC008 Trial
 All patients exiting RAMSES, ARTEMIS, ARC004 and ARC002 will be eligible to enroll in the ARC008 trial, which provides an opportunity for long-term safety surveillance and for patients to continue maintenance therapy at the target dose of 300 mg of AR101 at the dosing interval the patient had been receiving previously.
Additional Food Allergy Research and Development
 We intend to leverage the expertise we gained in the clinical development of AR101 to advance additional CODIT candidates for a range of food allergy biotherapeutics to address high unmet need. We expect to leverage our expertise in the formulation and pharmaceutical development of biologic drug products from naturally available food protein to accomplish this goal. As with AR101, we expect this process to require the identification of key protein antigens and allergenic protein epitopes, the development of analytic methods, the creation of usable and stable formulations and the ability to manufacture supplies within strict pharmaceutical processes.
AR201 for Egg Allergy
 Our Egg CODIT product candidate, AR201, is intended for the treatment of egg allergy in pediatric and young adult patients. Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in infants and young children. Published studies indicate that egg allergy is prevalent in approximately 1% of young children but resolves by age 16 in nearly 70% of patients and is therefore significantly less prevalent in the adult population. Based on our epidemiological analysis, we estimate the prevalence for egg allergy in two key markets, the United States and the European Union, to be approximately 1.5 million patients in the aggregate. Worldwide, we estimate that there are more than 6 million pediatric and adult patients, with a significant patient base in China and Japan, where egg is the most common food allergy. Allergists have observed that patients who have egg allergy that persist beyond childhood tend to be higher risk patients with more severe reactions, a population that is especially vulnerable to severe reactions in the case of accidental exposure. The ubiquity of egg in staple foods and current food labeling requirements make adherence to an avoidance diet especially difficult. Despite conscientious label reading, egg allergens can be present due to errors in food packaging and formulation as well as undisclosed ingredient substitutions.  
 These practical challenges along with the lack of proactive treatment represents a significant unmet need in pediatric and adult patients.    
 14

As a result, we believe there would be strong demand for an FDA-approved Egg CODIT product candidate. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019.  
 Other Research and Development Programs
 We are exploring additional research and development programs evaluating the potential application of CODIT in other food allergies, including walnuts, other tree nuts and cow’s milk.  
 We believe that approximately 0.4% - 0.6% of the U.S. population is allergic to walnuts. In addition, a high proportion of people who are allergic to walnuts are also allergic to pecans and other tree nuts due to preserved homology in allergenic epitopes. Tree nut allergy was estimated to be prevalent in approximately 2.3 million, or approximately 1%, of people ages 1-55 in the United States in 2017.  Similar to the dynamic of peanut allergy, tree nuts can be difficult to avoid.  Strict avoidance, supported by first line defense medication, such as epinephrine, is the standard of care. We are currently working on a formulation for a Walnut CODIT product candidate and are in parallel exploring the feasibility of a multi-nut formulation to desensitize against several tree nut allergies.
 Cow’s milk allergy is prevalent in approximately 1.7% of U.S. children, but resolves in nearly 80% of patients by age 16.  Similar to the dynamics of egg allergy, cow’s milk is particularly difficult to avoid considering it remains a cornerstone of nutrition and milk consumption is a key recommendation in the USDA’s 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines. More broadly, the ubiquity of milk and dairy consumption globally, supported by similar national dietary guidelines, translates into a 7 million global patient population.  Similar to other allergy management paradigms, strict avoidance, supported by first line defense medication, such as epinephrine, is the standard of care. 
 Collaborations
 Regeneron
 In October 2017, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Regeneron and its strategic alliance collaborator, Sanofi, to study AR101 treatment with adjunctive dupilumab in peanut-allergic patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial. The planned Phase 2 clinical trial includes a proposed primary endpoint of tolerating a certain dose of peanut protein in a DBPCFC that will include doses matching and exceeding those being tested in our current and previous AR101 studies. The study also includes a proposed exploration of sustained unresponsiveness after discontinuation of therapy in another DBPCFC. Sustained unresponsiveness is achieved when, after a break in treatment, peanut-allergic patients are able to tolerate a defined amount of peanut protein with no more than mild allergic symptoms. Regeneron will sponsor the clinical trial, and we will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials. The planned Phase 2 clinical trial began in October 2018.
 Nestle Health Science 
 In November 2016, we entered into a two-year strategic collaboration with an affiliate of Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. for the advancement of food allergy therapeutics and issued and sold to Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliate, Nestle Health Science) 7,552,084 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of $19.20 per share, which represented approximately 15.1% of our outstanding shares at the time of the transaction, for a total of $145.0 million. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science agreed to a two-year market standoff provision under which it agreed not to sell or transfer any of our common stock or other securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science also agreed to a two-year standstill agreement under which Nestle Health Science agreed not to acquire us through any means. We agreed to register the resale of the shares that Nestle Health Science purchased on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC upon the request of Nestle Health Science, which cannot make the request prior to the 45th day preceding the end of the market standoff provision. The investment and the collaboration did not include any development milestones, product marketing rights or royalties.
 In November 2018, Nestlé Health Science made an additional equity investment of $98.0 million for 3,237,529 newly issued shares of our common stock at $30.27 per share, increasing Nestlé Health Science’s ownership of Aimmune to approximately 19 %. We also entered into a two-year extension of the original two-year strategic collaboration agreement, focused on offering innovative food allergy therapies, with Nestlé Health Science. The agreement does not contain any partnership, collaboration, or negotiation restrictions on Aimmune. Aimmune retains all rights to its current and future pipeline assets, and Aimmune and Nestlé Health Science will collaborate towards successful development of such assets.
 15

The initial investment launched a two-year strategic collaboration, which was extended for an additional two years in November 2018, between us and Nestle Health Science, the terms of which enable both parties to discuss our current and future oral immunotherapy development programs through a newly established pipeline forum. Nestle Health Science will provide ongoing scientific, regulatory, and commercial expertise and advice to us through the pipeline forum. Any information disclosed in the collaboration will remain our confidential information, and any new ideas or inventions that arise that relate to our products will be our solely owned intellectual property. If we elect to seek a partner or collaborator for one of our oral immunotherapy development programs during the two-year term of the collaboration, Nestle Health Science will have a three-month period to negotiate exclusively with us. During the term of the collaboration, and for so long as Nestle Health Science holds not less than ten percent of our outstanding common stock, Nestle Health Science will be entitled to designate one nominee to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. In November 2016, Greg Behar joined our Board of Directors on behalf of Nestle Health Science. The strategic collaboration agreement contains a non-competition covenant pursuant to which Nestle Health Science has agreed not to engage in certain activities relating to OIT for the treatment of food allergies.
 Research and Development Expenses
 A significant portion of our operating expenses relates to the development of AR101. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our research and development costs were $133.4 million, $89.3 million, and $54.6 million, respectively, and are included in the research and development expense line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For further detail about the research and development activities, refer to the research and development section in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Sales and Marketing
 Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to commercialize AR101 in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States as well as allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets. We anticipate that this sales force could also support the commercialization of additional CODIT product candidates, if approved. We intend to focus our sales efforts on patients with more moderate to severe food allergies, particularly children and adolescents. We do not anticipate that a DBPCFC will be a requirement for prescribing AR101 as DBPCFCs are not widely used as a diagnostic tool in current clinical practice. Our CODIT therapeutic approach for food allergies may encompass providing a range of services, including telephone and e-mail support for patients, physician awareness and education activities, reimbursement assistance, benefit navigation and co-pay and patient assistance programs. Based on the estimated direct medical expenses associated with peanut allergy and the estimated number of people with peanut allergy in the United States, we believe the potential market opportunity for approved peanut allergy treatments in the United States could exceed one billion dollars annually.
Manufacturing
 We contract with and rely on third-party manufacturers to produce the food product and final biologic product for our product candidates and to package our product candidates. We have completed construction of a manufacturing facility in a leased building in Clearwater, Florida, at the site of one of our current contract manufacturers and installed equipment and qualified the operating systems in this new facility. This manufacturing facility became operational in November 2018. We plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility. We also plan to rely on other contract manufacturers for the production of supply for our clinical trials, and if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, for commercial supply.
 Our product candidates are manufactured in accordance with stringent manufacturing processes. Our processes are designed to ensure that that the total protein content of each formulation and the relative concentrations of particular proteins are consistent. Through our contract manufacturers, we are capable of producing dosages for certain product candidates with protein content as small as 0.2 mg and have developed advanced analytical methods to ensure each dose contains precisely defined amounts of multiple well-characterized allergenic proteins. Our formulations are also designed to ensure that the drug product is acceptably stable and can be easily mixed with food.
 AR101 is currently produced for us by a contract manufacturer using our proprietary process. This process involves several blending and characterization steps intended to ensure that each dose contains a precise amount of peanut flour containing a specific concentration of peanut protein. Because peanut flour is a sensitizing agent, AR101 must be produced on a manufacturing line that is physically separated from other manufacturing lines and that has its own ventilation system. The manufacturing line that we use to produce the clinical supply for our clinical trials will not be adequate to produce commercial supplies of AR101 and we expect to produce commercial supplies in our new manufacturing facility. We are also in the process of negotiating a supply agreement with our contract manufacturer pursuant to which the manufacturer would use our manufacturing line to produce commercial supplies of AR101 for us.

We also rely on separate contract manufacturers to provide packaging services for AR101. We plan on using blister packs and sachets as the final packaging configuration for our potential commercial launch of AR101. Stability testing of AR101 in the blister pack and sachet configurations is ongoing. Any complications with the stability testing in the blister pack or sachet configuration could delay the timing of our regulatory filings for AR101 and could result in a limited shelf life of the commercial product at the time of launch. In addition, regulatory authorities may not find our proposed packing configuration acceptable, which would also delay the timing of our regulatory filings or potential approval of AR101.
 Supplying appropriate clinical trial materials for our ongoing and upcoming clinical trials on a timely basis is a complex operation. There are multiple doses in the dose escalation phase of our AR101 clinical trials. In addition, each subject can proceed through the dose escalation phase at a different rate depending on how the subject responds to each new dose. For example, a subject can move up to the next dose, remain on the current dose or move down to the prior lower dose during the dose escalation phase of our trials. We believe that this dosing flexibility improves outcomes for clinical trial subjects. But this dosing flexibility also increases the complexity of supplying the appropriate doses to each clinical site on a timely basis. In addition, we conduct clinical trials in Europe. EU regulations require that each lot of clinical trial material be certified and released by a designated qualified person, or QP. This certification and release process in the EU can cause delays in supplying clinical trial materials to clinical sites. Any delays or errors in our AR101 supply chain logistics could delay or adversely affect our clinical trials.
 Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Qualifying manufacturers and providers of packaging services is a lengthy process. If at any time, one or more of our qualified contract organizations were not able to manufacture or package our drug product candidate or provide other requisite services, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 Our third-party suppliers (other than GPC), their facilities and all lots of product candidates used in our clinical trials and for commercial sales, if AR101 is approved, are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization and personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must be in compliance with these regulations to the FDA’s satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, which may include the evaluation of procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Further, producing commercial quantities of AR101 has required us to scale up our existing manufacturing process and design and institute rigorous quality control and assurance procedures in our new manufacturing facility. These procedures include qualification of the manufacturing equipment and building utility systems and validation of the manufacturing process at commercial scale. Designing and implementing these procedures are time-consuming and complex operations. Any aspects of this new manufacturing facility that do not meet the cGMP requirements to the FDA’s satisfaction or the periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities could cause a delay in the filing of an MAA for AR101.
 Suppliers
 Our lead product candidate, AR101, contains peanut flour and pharmaceutical-grade ingredients. We source the peanut flour from GPC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland. We chose to use peanut flour from GPC as the basis for AR101 because its peanut flour has been used in most of the leading academic studies of peanut allergy OIT and because we believe that the widespread use of GPC peanut products in the United States may make their peanut flour representative of the type of peanut protein that patients are most likely to encounter in an accidental exposure. The other ingredients in AR101, such as diluents, glidants and lubricants, are sourced from established producers of pharmaceutical grade ingredients. In order to develop AR101 as an FDA-approvable biological product, we took the further step of characterizing the protein signature of GPC flour. Independent scientific research has identified numerous peanut proteins that are the allergens that cause allergic reactions to peanuts. Three of these proteins appear to be the most significant and representative of the levels of the other proteins. Our characterization of AR101 is based on measuring total protein amount and the relative concentrations of those three key proteins as well as their potencies in an antibody binding assay.

We purchase standard food-grade peanut flour from GPC pursuant to a long-term exclusive commercial supply agreement, which was expanded and extended in January 2018. Under the terms of the restated agreement, we are obligated to purchase peanut flour exclusively from GPC, provided that GPC is able to supply the peanut flour in a timely manner with the quantity of peanut flour that we require. GPC is not allowed to sell several peanut flour products to any third party worldwide for use in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy, provided that we are in compliance with our exclusive purchase obligation and meet specified annual purchase commitments. The restated agreement remains in effect until ten years after the first delivery to us of peanut flour for commercial use and includes an option for us to extend the term for an additional five years. The restated agreement requires GPC to notify its wholesalers and distributors that the peanut flour products subject to the restated agreement cannot be used in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy. We also have a right of first refusal to obtain rights to new or existing GPC peanut flour products that are not already covered by the restated agreement if a third party intends to use the new or existing GPC product in OIT for the treatment of or cure of peanut allergy. We may terminate the restated agreement at any time for any reason upon providing 60 days’ written notice to GPC. Either party may terminate the restated agreement if the other party fails to cure their material breach within 30 days of receiving notice of such breach from the non-breaching party or if the other party fails to perform their obligations under the agreement for a continuous period of 120 days due to a force majeure event or an insolvency or bankruptcy-related events.
 In connection with the amendment and restatement of the agreement, we issued Archer Daniels Midland Company 300,000 shares of our common stock, vesting over a 3.5-year period. Subject to certain exceptions, in the event that the price per share of our common stock were to fall below a specified level, the restated agreement provides that GPC would only be prohibited from selling one peanut flour product to any third party in the United States, Mexico, Canada, the European Union or Japan for use in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy.
 From time to time, we have and may, in the ordinary course of business, continue to enter into commercial supply agreements with third-parties for the supply of ingredients and proteins necessary for our other product candidates in the ordinary course of business.  For example, in December 2018, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement for egg protein with Michael Foods, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, we have exclusive access to the clinical and commercial use of Michael Foods’ egg products for any egg allergy treatment, prevention or cure for a period of up to 15 years beyond the potential approval of AR201.
 Intellectual Property
 We have filed patent applications in the United States and international patent applications pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty relating to AR101 and certain of our other product candidates. Two patents, covering the formulation of and certain of our manufacturing methods for AR101, have been issued in the United States. There is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications. Even if patents do issue, there can be no assurance that the scope of the claims contained in the patents will be broad enough to provide protection from potentially competing products. If issued, our patents relating to AR101 are projected to expire in 2034 without taking into account any potential patent term extensions. Our patent applications seek protection relating to our formulations, methods of manufacture and improved methods for treating food allergies. We do not own or license, and do not anticipate that we will be able to obtain, a composition of matter patent over the active pharmaceutical ingredient in AR101 or for any other product candidates that are based on widely or readily available food products.
 In addition to patents, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our partners, collaborators, contract manufacturers, suppliers, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our partners and consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. 
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
 18

Many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or if they obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.
 
Currently there are no approved medical therapies for the treatment of food allergies. In October 2017, DBV Technologies S.A. announced results from its completed Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Viaskin Peanut, a patch technology that epicutaneously delivers food allergens to the patient with the goal of desensitizing the patient to the allergens, in peanut-allergic patients (4 to 11 years of age). DBV submitted, and then subsequently withdrew, a BLA for this product. However, DBV may resubmit the BLA after additional discussions with the FDA. If AR101 and/or any additional product candidate of ours is approved, they may face competition from DBV’s product candidates, if approved. AnaptysBio, Inc. is developing an IL-33 antibody, ANB020, for the treatment of atopic diseases including atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic asthma and previously, peanut allergy. Until recently, ANB020 is under investigation in a Phase 2a trial of approximately 20 adults with peanut allergy. IL-33 is an epithelial-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in atopic disease though its role in allergic inflammation is not fully understood. It is unclear at this time whether anti-IL-33 will have clinical meaningfulness in peanut allergy as monotherapy, either with or without co-administration of native antigen and it is unclear whether AnaptysBio, Inc. will continue to develop ANB020 for the treatment of peanut allergy.
We may also face competition from allergists who decide to provide OIT and other desensitization therapies to their patients using their own formulations of food allergens and treatment protocols rather than adopting our product candidates or we may face competition from companies that develop their own OIT products, other desensitization therapy products or products intended to prevent the onset of food allergies in infants or young children. In addition, peanut allergic patients may attempt to use food products as a substitute for AR101 in the fixed dosing portion of our AR101 treatment program.
 In the future, we may face competition from competitors seeking to use AR101 as a reference product while developing a biosimilar product candidate using the FDA’s abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway created pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics. To be considered a biosimilar, a product candidate must be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. In addition, there can be no clinically meaningful differences between the product candidate and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. We believe that the relative concentrations of relevant proteins in the peanut flour we source pursuant to our exclusive contract with the GPC are significantly different from the concentrations of proteins found in other commercially available sources of peanut flour, and that a product candidate using different concentrations of such proteins or different proteins might not be considered “highly similar” to AR101 by the FDA. Such a product candidate would not be eligible for the biosimilar approval pathway. However, there can be no guarantee that the FDA would agree with this interpretation.
 Under the BPCIA, a reference product may be eligible for a 12-year period of exclusivity starting from the date that the product is first licensed by the FDA pursuant to the approval of a BLA, during which time no approval of a biosimilar product under the abbreviated approval pathway may be made effective. We believe that if the FDA approves a BLA for AR101, AR101 should qualify for this 12-year period of market exclusivity, known as reference product exclusivity, such that no approval of a biosimilar version of our product could become effective prior to the expiration of that 12-year period. However, these exclusivity provisions have been subject to various interpretations that have not yet been fully addressed by the FDA, and there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider AR101 to be eligible for reference product exclusivity, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. In addition, even if AR101 were to receive reference product exclusivity, a competitor may seek approval of a product candidate under a full BLA rather than a biosimilar product application. In such a case, although the competitor would not enjoy the benefits of the abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval created under the BPCIA, the FDA would not be precluded from making effective an approval of the competitor product pursuant to a BLA prior to the expiration of our 12-year period of marketing exclusivity.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. In the United States, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for our products, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. The drug’s formulary placement generally determines the out-of-pocket costs to a patient in order to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products and related services.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental, third-party payor and media interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and possible legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in each country. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available treatment approaches. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Significant uncertainty also surrounds the reimbursement of allergists for administering the anticipated treatment regimen for AR101 and our other products candidates. In the United States, it is not certain whether the existing medical claim reimbursement codes used to compensate physicians for their time in administering a therapy will be adequate to compensate for a physician’s time in administering AR101 dose escalation visits. We may decide to support the creation of new codes and associated reimbursement rates to ensure that clinicians are adequately compensated; however, creation of new codes is a complicated and lengthy process, and we may not be successful in any such efforts. In addition, if a new code is supported by the American Medical Association, or the AMA, there is no guarantee that a third-party payor will provide reimbursement for such code as that decision is solely in the payor’s discretion and must be negotiated on a case by case basis between providers and payors. In markets outside of the United States, we will need to evaluate clinician compensation mechanisms in each market to determine whether there is appropriate payment of physicians for administration of the treatment regimens.

Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to directly commercialize our products.
 In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of certain injectable outpatient drugs, as well as prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.
 We expect that the current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since its enactment, there have also been other judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act )the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, will impact the law. Any changes will likely take time to unfold and it is uncertain if any such changes may impact our business.
 In addition, recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 In addition, third-party payors may revise the payment methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians for the procedures performed using our products, which could directly impact the demand for any of our product candidates that may be approved. 
 In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products candidates, or increase the co-pay obligations of patients. 
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation in the United States
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, promotion, advertising, storage, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre-clinical, clinical and commercial requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 21

Overview of Biologics Regulation in the United States
 In the United States, our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulations implemented by the FDA. Section 351(i)(1) of the PHSA defines a biological product (biologic) as a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation, and submission to the FDA, of a BLA after completion of clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical Studies and IND Application
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also generally includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology
, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. We filed an IND for AR201 in December 2018 for use in oral desensitization therapy for egg allergy in children and adults. We filed an IND for AR101 in April 2013 for use in oral desensitization therapy for peanut allergy in children and adults. Because there are no robust animal models of egg or peanut allergy, we did not conduct any pre-clinical efficacy studies of AR201 or AR101. In addition, because AR201 and AR101 are based on food products, the FDA did not require us to submit any pre-clinical toxicology data. 
 Clinical Trials
 An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is to be conducted must also approve the study. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three or four sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22

 
• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product licensure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional in vitro studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the safety, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review and Approval of a BLA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Applications for certain products, such as allergenic extracts, are exempt from such user fees and may not be subject to review under the same timelines as applications for user-fee-paying products.  
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is generally to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing  However, these review timelines may not apply to BLAs submitted for allergenic extract products.  Moreover, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 23

After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials and may limit further marketing of the product based on results of these post-marketing studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may also be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast-Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for that disease or condition. For a Fast-Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast-Track designated product candidate may also qualify for expedited review, under which the FDA generally sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. If criteria are not met for expedited review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after regulatory approvals are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In September 2014, the FDA granted AR101 Fast-Track designation.
 In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “Breakthrough Therapies.” A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products. Manufacturers of biologics and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of biologics. A company may make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
 The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, included the BPCIA, which amended the PHSA and established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. To date, few biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its current approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 25

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date that the reference product is first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of an application for a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years after the date that the reference product is first licensed by the FDA. These exclusivity provisions have been subject to various interpretations that have not yet been fully addressed by the FDA. In addition, even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 Other Healthcare Laws in the United States
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. The laws we are subject to include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, federal, civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 26

There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, in particular laws and regulations relating to protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified federal law requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH extends some of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards beyond “covered entities” making them also directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA-related violations and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The U.S. is also increasingly introducing new general data privacy and security legislation, including notably the recent California Consumer Privacy Act, which comes into force in 2020 and regulates the collection of personal information about California residents regardless of the industry in which the business operates.
 Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
 Government Regulation in Europe and European laws regarding the protection of personal data
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union, or EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
 There are two types of MAs:
  
• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.

• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 The collection and processing of personal data – including health data –EEA (including the EU), is currently governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became enforceable on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is collected and used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals in regard to their personal data and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR provides that EU and EEA Member States may make their own further laws and regulations, which may impose further limitations, including in relation to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which may result in differences between Member State laws, limit our ability to use and share personal data,  cause our costs to increase, and/or harm our business and/or financial condition. 
 We are also subject to strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the United States. The GDPR only permits exports of personal data outside the EEA where there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard the personal data (e.g., the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses or, in relation to exports to the US, the EU-US Privacy Shield) or where the country receiving such data is approved by the EU Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data. Where we transfer personal data out of the EEA, we rely on a number of data transfer solutions including in regard to transfers of personal data (HR data and non-HR data) to the US (and Switzerland), we are certified under the EU-US (and Swiss-US) Privacy Shield. If it were to be determined that we were not complying with our obligations under the EU-US (and/or Swiss-US) Privacy Shield framework(s) and we were to lose our applicable Privacy Shield certification from the US Department of Commerce, we will need to find an alternative solution for transferring personal data from EU to the US. Also, Brexit will mean that at some point the United Kingdom, or UK, will become a “third party” for the purposes of data transfers under the GDPR. Unless a withdrawal agreement and political declaration (the “Proposed Deal”) is agreed and approved between the EU and the UK prior to March 29, 2019 (the “Exit Date”), the UK will become a third party on the Exit Date. If the Proposed Deal is agreed and approved prior to March 29, 2019, the GDPR will continue to apply during the transition period (which is currently due to end on December 31, 2020, but may be extended) meaning that personal data exports from the EU / EEA to the UK can continue in the same manner until the end of the transition period (upon which compliant data transfer solutions will need to be put in place in regard to transfers from the EU / EEA to the UK). These changes introduced by Brexit may require us to find alternative solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data into (and possibly from) the UK.
 Where we are a data controller, we will be accountable for any service providers (including clinical research organizations) we engage to process personal data on our behalf. We attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using service providers by entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data from the EEA to such third parties, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements as described above. There is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the service provider’s processing, storage and transmission of such data. Any violation of data or security laws by our processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above.
 Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and other administrative penalties, as well as enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), orders to cease/ change our processing of our data, regulatory investigations and potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm, which may be onerous and adversely affect our clinical trials, business, reputation, financial condition, operations and prospects.
 We are also subject to evolving EU data privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. The EU is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, which will be directly effective in the laws of each EU Member State. The draft e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e. the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual revenue). While the e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process and commentators now expect it to be adopted during the second half of 2020 or during 2021 following a transition period.
