Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations: Includes certain ancillary businesses, interest expense and unallocated costs related to corporate support functions. The businesses in this segment include post-charge-off consumer debt collection services, customer relationship management services and information technology (“IT”) infrastructure management services. Interest expense relates to the Company’s senior secured term loan and corporate support functions include executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, facilities, risk management and sales and marketing costs not allocated to the business units. This segment also includes eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments.
We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests. In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue. Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services and sales of short-term investments in real estate. Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin. Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services that we pass directly on to our customers without a markup. Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Best Partners Mortgage Cooperative, Inc., doing business as Lenders One® (“Lenders One”). Lenders One is a mortgage cooperative managed, but not owned, by Altisource. Lenders One is included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource.
Effective January 1, 2017, our reportable segments changed as a result of a change in the way our Chief Executive Officer (our chief operating decision maker) manages our businesses, allocates resources and evaluates performance, and the related changes in our internal organization. We now report our operations through two new reportable segments: Mortgage Market and Real Estate Market. In addition, we report Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations separately. Prior to the January 1, 2017 change in reportable segments, our reportable segments were Mortgage Services, Financial Services and Technology Services. The former Mortgage Services segment was separated into the Mortgage Market and Real Estate Market segments. Furthermore, certain of the software services business units that were formerly in the Technology Services segment and the mortgage charge-off collections business that was formerly in the Financial Services segment are now included in the Mortgage Market. Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations includes asset recovery management services and customer relationship management services that were formerly in the Financial Services segment as well as IT infrastructure management services formerly in the Technology Services segment. Prior year comparable period segment disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation.

Customers
Our customers include some of the largest financial institutions in the United States, government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), utility companies, commercial banks, servicers, investors, non-bank originators and correspondent lenders, mortgage bankers, 
5

insurance companies and financial services companies. In addition, consumers are increasingly becoming customers of the Company through Owners.com, as this business continues to grow. During 2017, we entered into a strategic relationship with NRZ and were selected to provide services for large bank and non-bank loan servicers and lenders, positioning us well for 2018 and future years.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, Ocwen was our largest customer, accounting for 58% of our total revenue. Ocwen is a residential mortgage loan servicer for MSRs it owns, including those MSRs in which others have an economic interest, which includes NRZ, and purchases certain mortgage services and technology services from us under the terms of master services agreements and amendments thereto (collectively, the “Ocwen Services Agreements”) with terms extending through August 2025. Ocwen also purchases certain origination services from Altisource under an agreement that continues until January 2019, but which is subject to a 90 day termination right by Ocwen.
Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned from the loans serviced by Ocwen when Ocwen designates us as the service provider and revenue earned directly from Ocwen. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue from Ocwen of $542.0 million, $561.9 million and $631.6 million, respectively. Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Mortgage Market | 67% | 65% | 66% 
Real Estate Market | 1% | —% | 9% 
Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations | 11% | 27% | 37% 
Consolidated revenue | 58% | 56% | 60% 

We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen or the MSR owner selects Altisource as the service provider. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue of $148.5 million, $188.0 million and $216.9 million, respectively, related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen or the MSR owner selected Altisource as the service provider. These amounts are not included in deriving revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue in the table above.
As of December 31, 2017, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $18.9 million, $13.6 million of which was billed and $5.3 million of which was unbilled.
As of June 30, 2017, we estimate that NRZ owned certain economic rights in, but not legal title to, approximately 78% of Ocwen’s non-GSE MSRs (the “Subject MSRs”). In July 2017, Ocwen and NRZ entered into agreements to convert NRZ’s economic rights to the Subject MSRs into fully-owned MSRs in exchange for payments from NRZ to Ocwen when such MSRs were transferred. The transfers are subject to certain third party consents. Ocwen disclosed that under these agreements, Ocwen would subservice the transferred Subject MSRs for an initial term of five years, and the agreements provided for the conversion of the existing arrangements into a more traditional subservicing arrangement.
In January 2018, Ocwen disclosed that it and NRZ entered into new agreements to accelerate the implementation of certain parts of their July 2017 arrangement in order to achieve the intent of the July 2017 agreements sooner while Ocwen continues the process of obtaining the third party consents necessary to transfer the Subject MSRs to NRZ.
On August 28, 2017, Altisource, through its licensed subsidiaries, entered into a Cooperative Brokerage Agreement, as amended, and related letter agreement (collectively, the “Brokerage Agreement”) with NRZ which extends through August 2025. Under this agreement and related amendments, Altisource remains the exclusive provider of brokerage services for REO associated with the Subject MSRs when Ocwen transfers such MSRs to NRZ or when NRZ acquires both an additional economic interest in such MSRs and the right to designate the broker for REO properties in such portfolios. The Brokerage Agreement provides that Altisource is the exclusive provider of brokerage services for REO associated with the Subject MSRs, irrespective of the sub-servicer. NRZ’s brokerage subsidiary will receive a cooperative brokerage commission on the sale of certain REO properties from these portfolios subject to certain exceptions.
On August 28, 2017, Altisource and NRZ also entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (subsequently amended) to enter into a Services Agreement (the “Services LOI”), setting forth the terms pursuant to which Altisource would remain the exclusive service provider of fee-based services for the Subject MSRs through August 2025. The Services LOI was amended to continue through February 28, 2018 (with a further automatic extension through March 31, 2018 provided that the parties continue to negotiate the Services Agreement in good faith).
6

The Brokerage Agreement can be terminated by Altisource if the Services Agreement is not signed between Altisource and NRZ during the term of the Services LOI. The Brokerage Agreement may otherwise only be terminated upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Termination events include, but are not limited to, a breach of the terms of the Brokerage Agreement (including, without limitation, the failure to meet performance standards and non-compliance with law in a material respect), the failure to maintain licenses which failure materially prevents performance of the contract, regulatory allegations of non-compliance resulting in an adversarial proceeding against NRZ, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, appointment of a receiver, disclosure in a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q that there is significant uncertainty about Altisource’s ability to continue as a going concern, failure to maintain a specified level of cash and an unapproved change of control.
Following the execution of the Services Agreement, we anticipate that revenue from NRZ would increase and revenue from Ocwen would decrease. As Subject MSRs continue to transfer from Ocwen to NRZ, we anticipate that NRZ will become our largest customer. Had all of the Subject MSRs been transferred to NRZ and the Brokerage Agreement and the Services Agreement with NRZ were in place as of January 1, 2017, we estimate that approximately 50% of our 2017 revenue would have been related to NRZ. There can be no assurance that the parties will reach an agreement with respect to the terms of the Services Agreement or that a Services Agreement will be entered into on a timely basis or at all.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we earned revenue from NRZ of $2.4 million following the transfer of certain of the Subject MSRs from Ocwen to NRZ (the “Transferred MSRs”) (no comparative amounts in 2016 or 2015). For the year ended December 31, 2017, we earned additional revenue of $3.9 million relating to the Transferred MSRs when a party other than NRZ selects Altisource as the service provider (no comparative amounts in 2016 or 2015).
Our services are provided to customers primarily located in the United States. Financial information for our segments can be found in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing 
Our enterprise sales and marketing team and business unit sales executives have extensive relationship management and industry experience. These individuals cultivate and maintain relationships throughout the industry sectors we serve. We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms.
Our primary sales and marketing focus areas for institutional customers are to:

• | Expand relationships with existing customers by cross-selling additional services and growing the volume of existing services we provide. We believe our customer relationships represent a meaningful growth opportunity for us; 


• | Develop new customer relationships leveraging a comprehensive suite of services, strong performance and controls. We believe there is a large opportunity to provide our services to potential customers; and 


• | Sell new offerings to existing customers and prospects. Some of our newer offerings include our suite of support services for FHA mortgages, Vendorly™, a SaaS-based vendor management platform, Trelix Connect™, a SaaS-based loan review system, noteXchange®, a SaaS platform to facilitate whole loan purchase and sale transactions, and residential and commercial loan disbursement processing, risk mitigation and construction inspection services. 

Our primary sales and marketing focus areas for consumers are to:

• | Attract home buyers and sellers to Owners.com and Hubzu.com with a compelling value proposition through online marketing, search engine optimization and public relations; and


• | Leverage local real estate agents to provide personalized service to existing and prospective customers.

Given the highly regulated nature of the industries that we serve and the comprehensive purchasing process that our customers and prospects follow, the time and effort we spend in expanding relationships or winning new relationships is significant. For example, it can often take more than one year from the request for proposal or qualified lead stage to the selection of Altisource as a service provider. Furthermore, following the selection of Altisource, it is not unusual for it to take an additional six to twelve months or more to negotiate the services agreement(s), complete the implementation procedures and begin receiving referrals.
Intellectual Property and Data 
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trademarks and copyrights to establish and protect our trade secrets, intellectual property, software, technology and expertise. We also own or, as necessary and appropriate, have obtained licenses from third parties to intellectual property relating to our services, processes and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors in the success of our businesses.
7

As of December 31, 2017, we have been awarded one patent that expires in 2023, four patents that expire in 2024, eight patents that expire in 2025, two patents that expire in 2026, two patents that expire in 2029 and one patent that expires in 2030. In addition, we have registered trademarks, or recently filed applications for the registration of trademarks, in a number of jurisdictions including the United States, the European Union (“EU”), India and nine other jurisdictions. These trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely, provided they are being used in commerce.
We actively protect our rights and intend to continue our policy of taking the measures we deem reasonable and necessary to develop and protect our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights.
In addition, we may make use of data in connection with certain of our services. This data generally relates to mortgage information, real property information and consumer information. We gather this data from a variety of third party sources, including from governmental entities and, subject to licensed usage rights, we use this data in connection with the delivery of our services, including combining it with proprietary data we generate to further enhance data and metrics in connection with our services.
Market and Competition
We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms. The mortgage and real estate markets are very large and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, home prices, inflation, unemployment rates and consumer confidence.
The markets to provide services for mortgage servicers and mortgage originators are highly competitive and generally consist of a few national companies, in-house providers and a large number of regional and local providers. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
The markets to provide services for buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and start-up companies. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, ease of transacting, price and personal service.
For financial services firms, we provide collection services and customer relationship management services. The markets to provide these services are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and in-house providers. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
Our competitors may have greater financial resources, brand recognition, alternative or disruptive products and other competitive advantages. We cannot determine our market share with certainty, but believe for mortgage servicers and collection services for financial services firms, we have a modest share of the market, and for the others we have relatively small market share.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had the following number of employees:

 | United States | India | | Philippines | Uruguay | Luxembourg | | Consolidated Altisource
Mortgage Market | 745 | | 2,964 | | 177 | | 8 | | 4 | 3,898
Real Estate Market | 167 | | 199 | | 140 | | 1 | | 5 | 512 
Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations | 565 | | 1,951 | | 361 | | 129 | | 12 | 3,018
Total employees | 1,477 | | 5,114 | | 678 | | 138 | | 21 | 7,428

We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.
Seasonality
Certain of our revenues are impacted by seasonality. More specifically, revenues from property sales, loan originations and certain property preservation services typically tend to be at their lowest level during the fall and winter months and at their highest level 
8

during the spring and summer months. In addition, the asset recovery management business tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the remainder of the year.
Government Regulation
Our business and the business of our customers are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), various federal and state banking regulators and the state and local agencies that license or oversee certain of our auction, real estate brokerage, mortgage and debt collection services, trustee services, property management services and insurance services. We also must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others:

• | the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”);


• | the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (“CHBR”);


• | the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”);


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”);


• | the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”);


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”);


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”);


• | the Fair Housing Act;


• | the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”);


• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”);


• | the Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”);


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”);


• | the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”);


• | the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (“RPAPL”);


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”);


• | the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (“SAFE”) Act;


• | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”);


• | the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”);


• | the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”); and


• | Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices statutes (“UDAAP”).

We are also subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws, due to our activities in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition to federal and state laws regarding privacy and data security, we are also subject to data protection laws in the countries in which we operate. Additionally, we anticipate that we will be subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) when it goes into effect on May 25, 2018.
Legal requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended. One such enacted regulation is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and includes reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the CFPB, a federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services and products. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (“Mortgage Act”). The Mortgage Act imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending and expanding certain existing regulations. The interpretation or enforcement by regulatory authorities of applicable laws and regulations also may change over time. In addition, the creation of new regulatory authorities or changes in the regulatory authorities overseeing applicable laws and regulations may also result in changing interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations.
Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or changing interpretation of such laws or regulations could subject the Company to criminal or civil liability, significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders affecting us or our customers that may curtail or restrict the business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Furthermore, certain of our technology services are provided at the direction of, and pursuant to, the identified requirements of our customers. The failure of our customers to properly identify or account for regulatory requirements applicable to such technology services could expose us to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
9

We may be subject to licensing and regulation as a provider of certain services including, among others, services as a mortgage origination underwriter, mortgage broker, valuation provider, appraisal management company, asset manager, property manager, property renovator, property lessor, title insurance agent, insurance broker and underwriter, real estate broker, auctioneer, foreclosure trustee and debt collector in a number of jurisdictions. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by or registered with various jurisdictions for the particular type of service sold or provided and to participate in regular continuing education programs. Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities relating to certain aspects of our business. We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any of these inquiries. In conjunction with one such inquiry and as previously disclosed, Altisource received a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (“NORA”) letter on November 10, 2016 from the CFPB indicating that the CFPB is considering a potential enforcement action against Altisource relating to an alleged violation of federal law focused on REALServicing® and certain other technology services provided to Ocwen, including claims related to the features, functioning and support of such technology. The NORA process provides the recipient an opportunity to present its positions to the CFPB before an enforcement action is recommended or commenced. On December 5, 2016, we provided a written response to the NORA letter setting forth the legal, policy and factual reasons why we believe an enforcement action is not warranted. We are committed to resolving any potential concerns of the CFPB. If the CFPB were to bring an enforcement action against us, the resolution of such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. However, we believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any potential CFPB enforcement action.
