Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a market leader in the new era of health care delivery and payment, in which leading health systems and physician organizations, which we refer to as providers, are taking on increasing clinical and financial responsibility for the populations they serve. Our purpose-built platform, powered by our technology, proprietary processes and integrated services, enables providers to migrate their economic orientation from FFS reimbursement to payment models that reward high-quality and cost-effective care, or value-based payment models. By partnering with providers to accelerate their path to value-based care, we enable our provider partners to expand their market opportunity, diversify their revenue streams, grow market share and improve the quality of the care they provide. 
We believe we are pioneers in enabling health systems to succeed in value-based payment models. We were founded in 2011 by members of our management team, UPMC, an integrated delivery system based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and The Advisory Board, to enable providers to pursue a value-based business model and evolve their competitive position and market opportunity. We consider value-based care to be the necessary convergence of health care payment and delivery. We believe the pace of this convergence is accelerating, driven by price pressure in traditional FFS health care, a market environment that is incentivizing value-based care models and innovation in data and technology. We believe providers are positioned to lead this transition to value-based care because of their control over large portions of health care delivery costs, their primary position with consumers and their strong local brand.
Today, increasing numbers of providers are adopting value-based strategies, including contracting for capitated arrangements with existing insurance companies, governmental payers or large self-funded employers and managing their own captive health plans. Through value-based care, providers are in the early stages of transforming their role in health care as they attempt to defend their existing position and capture a greater portion of the more than two trillion dollars in annual health insurance expenditures. While there is not a universally agreed-upon definition of value-based care, we estimate that approximately 10% of health care payments were paid through value-based care programs as of June 2014, including through models created by systems like UPMC, Kaiser Permanente and Intermountain Healthcare, it is estimated that this number will grow to over approximately 50% by 2020. There were over 140 provider-owned health plans as of 2016 and this number continues to grow. The number of ACOs constructed to manage capitated or value-based arrangements with existing insurance companies or government payers grew to 838 as of January 2016.
We believe the transformation of the provider business model will require a set of core capabilities, including the ability to aggregate and understand disparate clinical and financial data, standardize and integrate technology into care processes, manage population health and build a financial and administrative infrastructure that capitalizes on the clinical and financial value it delivers. We provide an end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled services platform for providers to transition their organization and business model to succeed in value-based payment models. In certain instances, we participate alongside our partners in risk-sharing arrangements whereby we share in a portion of the upside and downside performance of the value strategy. The core elements of our services platform include:

• | Integrated technology, proprietary process and financial and administrative services model that enables the delivery of a high-performing population health organization, an aligned clinical delivery network to provide high-quality, coordinated care and an efficient administrative infrastructure to administer value-based care payment relationships.


◦ | Identifi®, our proprietary technology, delivers the data aggregation and stratification, proven value-based care content, EMR optimization and proprietary applications that allow providers to standardize the delivery of care and enable clinical and financial analytics.


◦ | Our complementary value-based operations are empowered and supported by Identifi®. Other elements include: (1) an aligned clinical delivery network to provide improved, coordinated care, (2) a high-performing population health organization that drives clinical outcomes and (3) integration of cost management solutions including PBM and patient risk scoring. 


◦ | Our comprehensive financial and administrative management services enable providers to operate, manage and capitalize on a variety of value-based payment arrangements


• | A single point of integration between payers and the provider community enables us to provide an indispensable single point of integration between a diverse set of payers that becomes more valuable over time as our services platform becomes the standard for value-based care contracting and operations.

In October 2016, we acquired Valence Health. Valence Health, based in Chicago, Illinois, was founded in 1996 and provides value- based administration, population health and advisory services with a particular focus on the Medicaid and pediatric markets. We believe that the acquisition of Valence Health is highly complementary to Evolent’s business and brings a number of strategic benefits including: (1) enhanced capabilities in value-based care administration and claims processing; (2) increased presence and experience in the Medicaid market and (3) additional scale to our platform in the form of approximately 1.0 million incremental lives under 
1

operating agreements. On January 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of assets related to NMHC’s commercial business. Following the completion of the transaction, we contributed the assets of NMHC’s commercial business to True Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. True Health is a commercial health plan we operate in New Mexico that focuses on small and large businesses. We expect to be able to leverage our platform to support a value-based provider-centric model of care in the state.
We believe our business model provides strong visibility and aligns our partners’ incentives with our own. Through our financial and administrative management services, we capture value through a variety of value-based payment arrangements and, in certain circumstances, participate alongside our partners in risk-sharing arrangements. A large portion of our revenue is derived from our multi-year contracts, which are linked to the number of members that our partners are managing under a value-based care arrangement. This variable pricing model depends on the population being served as well as the number of services and technology applications that our partners utilize to advance their value-based care strategies and the number of members they are able to attract over time. We expect to grow with current partners as they increase membership in their existing value-based programs, through expanding the number of services we provide to our existing partners, by adding new partners and by capturing value through upside risk-sharing arrangements.
We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on these aligned operating partnerships. We believe our health system partners’ current value-based care arrangements represent a small portion of the health system’s total revenue each year. We believe the proportion of value-based care related revenues to total health system revenues will continue to grow, driven by continued price pressure in FFS, new government payment programs, growth in consumer-focused insurance programs, such as Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid, and innovation in data and technology. Our business model benefits from scale, as we leverage our purpose-built technology-enabled services platform and centralized resources in conjunction with the growth of our partners’ membership base. These resources include our network development capabilities, health plan administrative services, PBM administration, technology development, clinical program development and data analytics and network development. While our absolute investment in our centralized resources and technologies will increase over time, we expect it will decrease as a percentage of revenue as we are able to scale this investment across a broader group of partners.
We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reportable segment; however, we anticipate that we will report the results of True Health as a new reportable segment effective first quarter of 2018. See “Part II - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding revenue, profit and total assets of our single operating segment. All of our revenue is recognized in the United States and all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
Our Market Opportunity
For 2017, health care spending in the United States was projected to be more than $3.4 trillion. We believe that for the U.S. health care system to shift to a value-based care delivery model, providers must be an empowered part of the solution. Our comprehensive technology and services platform enables providers to capitalize on this transition, which we believe will position us to be at the forefront of the transformation to value-based care.
We believe our total market opportunity for our services platform is over $10.0 billion today based on health insurance expenditures, the total percentage of payments providers receive under value-based contracting, the size of the provider-sponsored health plan market and the fees we believe we can charge. We believe this opportunity will grow to over $45.0 billion by 2020 driven by health insurance expenditures increasing from approximately $2.1 trillion in 2013 to approximately $3.2 trillion in 2020, the total percentage of payments providers receive under value-based care models growing from 10% as of June 2014 to over 50% in 2020, and the provider-sponsored health plan market representing 15% of total health plan membership in 2020.
Our Solution
We provide an end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled services platform for providers to succeed in value-based payment models. 
Supporting Multiple Value-Based Care Models
Our services platform was built to support a diverse set of provider value-based care strategies. It provides the core technology and services necessary for all models pursued by providers.
Providers partner with us on at least one of three types of value-based contracting models, with most supporting at least the Direct to Employer model and one additional type of contracting arrangement.

• | Direct to Employer: Manage costs for self-funded employers including a health system’s own employees 


• | Payer contracts: Value-based contracts with third-party payors (including commercial insurers and the government) that include a full spectrum of risk for pay for performance through full capitation arrangements 

2


• | Health plan: Launching a provider-owned health plan allows providers to control all of the health care insurance premiums, or premium dollars, across multiple populations, including commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. 

Our partners benefit from a single platform that enables them to utilize our core suite of ongoing solutions, regardless of the size or type of value-based care models they are pursuing. Our services platform grows through health systems increasing membership in their existing value-based care payment model, as well as their pursuit of additional payer contracts and health plans. In certain cases, we participate alongside our partners through various risk-sharing arrangements, including loans, provision of letters of credit, equity investments, reinsurance arrangements and other extensions of capital.
Proprietary Technology - Identifi®
Identifi® is our proprietary technology system that aggregates and analyzes data, manages care workflows and engages patients. Identifi® links our processes with those of our provider partners and other third parties in order to create a connected clinical delivery ecosystem, stratify patient populations, standardize clinical work flows and enable high-quality, cost-effective care. The configurable nature and broad capabilities of Identifi® help enhance the benefits our partners receive from our Value-Based Operations and increase the effectiveness of our partners’ existing technology architecture. Highlights of the capabilities of Identifi® include the following:

• | Data and integration services: Data from disparate sources, such as EMRs, and lab and pharmacy data, is collected, assembled, integrated and maintained in order to provide health care professionals with a holistic view of the patient. 


• | Clinical and business content: Clinical and business content is applied to the integrated data to create actionable information in order to optimize clinical and financial performance. 


• | EMR integration: Data and clinical insights from Identifi® are fed back into partner EMRs to improve both provider and patient satisfaction, create workflow efficiencies, promote clinical documentation and coding and provide clinical support at the point-of-care. 


• | Applications: A suite of cloud-based applications manages the clinical, financial and operational aspects of the value-based model. Our applications are individually purchased and scale with the clinical, financial and administrative needs of our provider partners. As additional capabilities are required through our services platform, they are often deployed as applications through Identifi®. 

Value-Based Operations
Our Value-Based Operations are empowered and supported by Identifi®. Other elements include: (1) an aligned clinical delivery network to provide improved, coordinated care, (2) a high-performing population health organization that drives clinical outcomes and (3) integration of cost management solutions including PBM and patient risk scoring. We integrate change management processes and ongoing physician-led transformation into all value-based services to build engagement, integration and alignment within our partners in order to successfully deliver value-based care and sustain performance. We have standardized the processes described below and are able to leverage our expertise across our entire partner base. Through the technological and clinical integration we achieve, our solutions are delivered as ingrained components of our partner’s core operations rather than add-on solutions. 
Delivery Network Alignment
We help our partners build the capabilities that are required to develop and maintain a coordinated and financially-aligned provider network that can deliver high-quality care necessary for value-based contracts. These capabilities include:

• | High-performance network: Supporting the capabilities needed to build, maintain and optimize provider- and clinically-integrated networks. 


• | Value compensation models: Developing and supporting physician incentive payment programs that are linked to quality outcomes, payer shared savings arrangements and health plan performance. 


• | Integrated specialty partnerships: Supporting the technology-enabled strategies, analytics and staff needed to optimize network referral patterns. 

Population Health Performance
Population Health Performance is an integrated suite of technology-enabled solutions that supports the delivery of quality care in an environment where a provider’s need to manage health has significantly expanded. These solutions include: 

• | Clinical programs: Care processes and ongoing clinical innovation that enables providers to target the right intervention at the right time for a given patient. 


• | Specialized care team: Multi-disciplinary team that is deployed telephonically from a centralized location or throughout a local market to operate clinical programs, engage patients and support physicians. 


• | Patient engagement: Integrated technologies and processes that enable outreach to engage patients in their own care process. 

3


• | Quality and risk coding: Engagement of physicians to identify opportunities to close gaps in care and improve clinical documentation efforts. 

Integrated Cost and Revenue Management Solutions
We seek to integrate traditional cost and revenue management solutions such as PBM and risk adjustment to achieve greater adoption and performance than traditional payer-led models.

• | Pharmacy benefit management: Our team of professionals support the drug component of providers’ plan offerings and bring national buying power and dedicated resources that are tightly integrated with the care delivery model. Differentiated from what we consider to be traditional PBMs, our solution is integrated into patient care and engages population health levers including generic utilization, provider management, and utilization management to reduce unit pharmacy costs. 


• | Risk adjustment: Our provider-led risk adjustment solution leverages Identifi® and integrates with partners’ EMRs to minimize disruption to the physician practice and maximize physician engagement. Our prospective and retrospective risk adjustment offerings utilize comprehensive data sources to capture medical history and sophisticated analytics and workflow tools with the aim of increasing the accuracy and efficiency of retrieval and documentation. We believe that through better provider engagement and intelligent use of data, our integrated model drives more accurate documentation of patient acuity, which optimizes reimbursement and improves the quality of care. 

Financial and Administrative Management Services
We help providers assemble the complete infrastructure required to operate, manage and capitalize on a variety of value-based payment arrangements. These capabilities include:

• | Health plan services: A comprehensive suite of services including third-party administration, enrollment and billing support, medical and utilization management, third-party payment and program integrity support and provider network contracting services. Other health plan related services include sales and marketing, product development, actuarial, and regulatory and compliance. 


• | Risk management: The capabilities needed to successfully manage risk from payers, including analysis, data and operational integration with payer processes, and ongoing performance management.


• | Analytics and reporting: The ongoing and ad hoc analytic teams and reports required to measure, inform and improve performance, including population health analytics, market analytics, network evaluation, staffing models, physician effectiveness, clinical delivery optimization and patient engagement. 


• | Leadership and management: Our local and national talent assist our partners in effectively managing the performance of their value-based operations. 

True Health
Following our acquisition of assets from NMHC on January 2, 2018, we own and operate True Health, a commercial health plan focused on serving small and large businesses across New Mexico, with approximately 20,000 members as of December 31, 2017. We expect to be able to leverage our platform to support a value-based provider-centric model of care in the state.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the transformations occurring in health care payment and delivery described above. We believe this new environment that rewards the better use of information to drive patient outcomes aligns with our platform, recent investments and other competitive strengths.
Early Innovator
We believe we are an innovator in the delivery of a comprehensive value-based care solution for providers. We were founded in 2011, ahead of the implementation of the ACA and before the rapid expansion of programs, such as Medicare ACOs or Medicare Bundled Payment Initiatives. Since our inception, we have invested a significant amount in our offerings.
Comprehensive End-to-End Solution
We provide an end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled services platform for providers to transition their organization and business model to succeed in value-based payment models. We believe that offering a comprehensive and integrated solution which brings together population health management along with financial and administrative management on a single platform allows providers to accelerate their path to adoption of value-based care.

Integrated Proprietary Technology
Our integrated proprietary technology, Identifi®, allows us to deliver a connected delivery ecosystem, implement replicable clinical processes, scale our Value-Based Operations and capitalize on multiple types of value-based payment relationships. Identifi® supports the following capabilities:

• | Data aggregation from internal and external sources, such as EMRs and payer claims;


• | Algorithmic interpretation of aggregated data to stratify populations and identify high-risk patients;


• | Standardized workflows and dashboards to enable consistency across disparate clinical resources;


• | Applications to support value-based business models;


• | Patient outreach and engagement tools;


• | Integration into physician workflows to proactively engage high-priority patients; and


• | Reporting and tracking of clinical and financial outcomes.

We believe we are creating scaled benefits for our provider partners in areas such as data analytics, administrative services and care management. We expect Identifi® to enable us to deliver increasing levels of efficiency to our provider partners.
Provider-Centric Brand Identity
We believe our provider-centric brand identity and origins differentiate us from our competitors. We believe our solutions, which have built on capabilities developed at UPMC, resonate with potential partners seeking proven solutions from providers rather than large payers or non-health care businesses. Our analytical and clinical solutions are rooted in UPMC’s experience in growing a provider-led, integrated delivery network over the past 15 years, and growing to become one of the largest provider-owned health plans in the country. Our unique position allows for the sharing of data across multiple payers and care delivery integration regardless of payer, which we believe is not possible with payer led solutions.
Partnership-Driven Business Model
Our business model is predicated on strategic partnerships with leading providers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the provider care delivery and payment work flow, contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit. In certain cases, we also agree to participate alongside our partners in risk-sharing or other support arrangements to increase our alignment of interests.
Proven Leadership Team
We have made a significant investment in building an industry-leading management team. Our senior leadership team has extensive experience in the health care industry and a track record of delivering measurable clinical, financial and operational improvement for health care providers and payers. Our chief executive officer, Frank Williams, was formerly the chief executive officer of The Advisory Board, where he oversaw the growth of the company and its IPO. 
Growth Opportunities
Multiple Avenues for Growth with Our Existing, Embedded Partner Base
We have established a multi-year partnership model with multiple drivers of embedded growth through the following avenues:

• | growth in lives in existing covered populations;


• | partners expanding into new lines of value-based care to capture growth in new profit pools;


• | partners utilizing our additional capabilities, such as new Identifi® applications, PBM and TPA services; and


• | capturing value created through a variety of value-based arrangements by participating alongside our partners in upside risk sharing arrangements.

In addition to growth within our existing partner base, opportunities exist with providers utilizing our Blueprint, who sign short-term contracts under which we analyze the opportunities available to them in the value-based care market. From time to time, we also evaluate and consider pursuing opportunities to expand into businesses related to the services we currently provide.

Early Stages of a Rapidly Growing Transformational Addressable Market
We believe that our existing partners represent a small fraction of health systems that could benefit from our solutions. The transformation of the care delivery and payment model in the United States has been rapid, but it is still in the early stages. While approximately 10% of health care payments were paid through value-based care programs as of June 2014, it is estimated that this number will grow to over 50% by 2020. 
Capitalize on Growth in Select Government-Driven Programs
Significant growth is projected in the number of people managed by government-driven programs in the United States over the next eight years. Specifically, CMS projects the number of Medicare beneficiaries to grow to approximately 63 million by 2020 from approximately 56 million at the end of 2016. We expect health systems to be direct beneficiaries of growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care because those specific markets are well suited for value-based care. We believe that the growth in government programs will create an opportunity for health systems to capture a greater portion of the over two trillion dollars in annual health insurance expenditures. For example, in 2016, we launched our Next Generation ACO offering wherein, in addition to our services offering, we share in a portion of the upside and downside financial performance of the ACO through our fee structures with certain customers. The nature of our variable fee economic model enables us to benefit from this growth in government-managed lives. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to government-driven programs, primarily comprised of Medicaid and, to a less significant extent, Medicare. This dynamic represents a change from prior periods and results in part from our acquisition of Valence Health as well as our strategic alliance with Passport. Since 2016, the Company has significantly expanded its presence in Medicaid and continues to look for additional ways to expand in the market, in part, by aligning itself with providers by participating in state mandated managed Medicaid initiatives. To this end, the Company has entered into a number of joint venture agreements to participate in various state mandated managed Medicaid initiatives. 
Ability to Capture Additional Value through Delivering Clinical Results
We are capturing only a portion of the administrative dollars in the market through our current solution, which represent over 10% of total premium dollars. We believe there is a significant opportunity to capture a portion of the medical dollar over time—namely the remainder of the premium dollar which goes to medical expenses. As our health system partners continue to own a larger percentage of overall premiums, we have begun to pursue business models that allow us to participate in the medical savings through a variety of risk-sharing arrangements that align incentives to reduce costs and improve quality outcomes.
Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
There are multiple business offerings that health systems may require to operate in a value-based care environment that we do not currently provide, including but not limited to:

• | PBM expansion to include additional specialty pharmacy management capabilities;


• | health savings account administration;


• | on-site or specialty clinic services; and


• | consumer engagement and digital outreach.

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Investments
We believe that the nature of our competitive landscape provides meaningful acquisition opportunities. Our industry is in the early stages of its life cycle and there are multiple firms attempting to capitalize on the transformation of the care delivery model and the various forms of new profit pools. We believe that providers will require an end-to-end solution and we believe we are well positioned to meet this demand by expanding the breadth of our offerings through not only organic growth, but also the acquisition of niche providers and non-core portions of larger enterprises. From time to time, we may also pursue acquisition and investment opportunities of businesses related to services we currently provide or that are complementary to our technical capabilities. As an example of executing on our strategy, in February 2016, we entered into a strategic alliance with a leading nonprofit community-based and provider-sponsored health plan administering Kentucky Medicaid and federal Medicare Advantage benefits. This alliance created the Medicaid Center of Excellence, which offers centralized services for provider-led Medicaid health plans. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisitions of Valence Health and Aldera, expanding our capabilities and expertise in the Medicaid and pediatric markets, as well as the provision of certain third party administration services. On January 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of assets related to NMHC’s commercial business. Following the completion of the transaction, we contributed the assets of NMHC’s commercial business to True Health. True Health is a commercial health plan we operate in New Mexico that focuses on small and large businesses. We expect to be able to leverage our platform to support a value-based provider-centric model of care in the state.

Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services to providers throughout the United States. Our dedicated sales team targets provider opportunities for our services platform solutions. Our sales team works closely with our leadership team and subject matter experts to foster long-term relationships with our provider partner’s leadership and board of directors given the nature of our partnerships. Our dedicated business development team works closely with our partners to identify additional service opportunities that can be offered from our services platform on a continuous basis.
Partner Relationships
Our business model is predicated on strategic partnerships with leading providers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the provider care delivery and payment work flow, contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit.
We have sought to partner with leading providers in sizable markets, which we believe creates a growth cycle that benefits from the secular transition to value-based care. By helping these systems lower clinical and administrative costs, we believe we are positioning them to offer a low cost, effective care setting to payers, employers and consumers, which enables them to capture greater market share. As providers have succeeded in lowering costs and growing market share, this enables them to increase their value-based offerings. By virtue of our business model, we benefit from our partners’ growth.
As of December 31, 2017, we had contractual relationships with over 25 operating partners and a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a single partner, Passport, which comprised 20.6% of our revenue for 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our average contractual relationship with our operating partners was approximately four years, with an average of 1.8 years of performance remaining per contract. The contracts governing the relationships with our operating partners include key terms which may include the period of performance, revenue rates, advanced billing terms, service level agreements, termination clauses, exclusivity clauses and right of first refusal clauses.
Typically, the terms of these contracts provide for a monthly payment that is calculated based on a specified rate multiplied by the number of members that our partners are managing under a value-based care arrangement. The specified rate varies depending on which market-facing solutions the partner has adopted and the number of services and technology applications they are utilizing. Typically, the terms of these contracts allow for advance billing of our partners. In some of our contracts, a defined portion of the revenue is at risk and can be refunded to the partner if certain service levels are not attained. We monitor our compliance with the service levels to determine whether a refund will be provided and record an estimate of these refunds.
Although the revenue from our contracts is not guaranteed because certain of our contracts are terminable for convenience by our partners after a notice period has passed, certain partners would be required to pay us a termination fee in certain circumstances. Termination fees and the related notice period in certain of our contracts are determined based on the scope of the market-facing solutions that the partner has adopted and the duration of the contract. Most of our contracts include cure periods for certain breaches, during which time we may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a partner’s ability to terminate the contract. However, certain of our contracts are also terminable immediately on the occurrence of certain events. For example, some of our contracts may be terminated by the partner if we fail to achieve target performance metrics over a specified period. Certain of our contracts may be terminated by the partner immediately following repeated failures by us to provide specified levels of service over periods ranging from six months to more than a year. Certain of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the partner if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. The loss, termination or renegotiation of any contract could negatively impact our results. In addition, as our partners’ businesses respond to market dynamics and financial pressures, and as our partners make strategic business decisions in respect of the lines of business they pursue and programs in which they participate, we expect that certain of our partners will, from time to time, seek to restructure their agreements with us.
The contracts often contain exclusivity or other restrictive provisions, which may limit our ability to partner with or provide services to other providers or purchase services from other vendors within certain time periods and in certain geographic areas. The exclusivity and other restrictive provisions are negotiated on an individual basis and vary depending on many factors, including the term and scope of the contract. The time limit on these exclusivity and other restrictive provisions typically corresponds to the term of the contract. These exclusivity or other restrictive provisions often apply to specific competitors of our health system partners or specific geographic areas within a particular state or an entire state, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, exceptions for employer plan entities that have operations in the restricted geographic areas but that are headquartered elsewhere. Accordingly, these exclusivity clauses may prevent us from entering into relationships with certain potential partners.
The contracts with our partners impose other obligations on us. For example, we typically agree that all services provided under the partner contract and all employees providing such services will comply with our partner’s policies and procedures. In addition, in 
7

most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our partners against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties.
Competition
The market for our products and services is fragmented, competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities.
We compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. We also compete on the basis of price.
Our health plan, True Health, also competes with local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by large commercial health care benefit insurance companies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. For additional information related to competition in our health plan business, see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks relating to our business and industry.”
Health Care and Insurance Laws and Regulations
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce health care laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable health care and insurance laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and state laws and regulations that impact our operations:
Health Care Reform
In March 2010, the ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to, collectively, as health care reform, was signed into law. Health care reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. For example, health care reform includes a mandate that employers with over 50 employees offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer Individual Major Medical plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality; establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels.
Health care reform amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Services Act. Health care reform is being implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. Most of the ACA regulations became effective on January 1, 2014.
The current administration and Congress have been seeking, and we expect they will continue to seek, legislative and regulatory changes to health care laws and regulations, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the ACA. In January 2017, President Trump issued an executive order titled “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal.” The order directed agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, health care providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Since January 2017, Congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA have been unsuccessful. However, the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the repeal of the individual mandate on our business. The impact of the repeal and the executive order as well as the future of the ACA remain unclear. Further, the public exchange market is currently experiencing significant disruptions, as many insurers have incurred significant losses and announced their withdrawal from health insurance exchanges in a number of states. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the timing of and potential for further legal challenges, repeal or amendment of that legislation and future of the health insurance exchanges, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ACA on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In addition, Congress, state legislatures and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the health care delivery system, including with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, 
8

or effect of any changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation or changes. Health care reform has resulted in profound changes to the individual health insurance market and our business, and we expect these changes to continue.

We are subject to federal and state “self-referral” laws. The Stark Law is a federal statute that prohibits physicians from referring patients for items covered by Medicare or Medicaid to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship, unless that relationship falls within a specified exception. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute and is violated even if the parties did not have an improper intent to induce physician referrals. The Stark Law is relevant to our business because we frequently organize arrangements of various kinds under which (a) physicians and hospitals jointly invest in and own ACOs, clinically integrated networks and other entities that engage in value-based contracting with third-party payors or (b) physicians are paid by hospitals or hospital affiliates for care management, medical or other services related to value-based contracts. We evaluate when these investment and compensation arrangements create financial relationships under the Stark Law and design structures that are intended to satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver.
Anti-kickback Laws
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. The United States federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities knowingly and willfully to solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute raises similar compliance issues as the Stark Law. While there are safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, they differ from the Stark Law exceptions in that compliance with a safe harbor is not mandatory. If an arrangement falls outside the safe harbors, it must be evaluated on its specific facts to assess whether regulatory authorities might take the position that one purpose of the arrangement is to induce referrals of federal health care program business. Our business arrangements implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute for the same reasons they raise Stark Law issues. We evaluate whether investment and compensation arrangements being developed by us on behalf of hospital partners fall within one of the safe harbors or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver. If not, we consider the factors that regulatory authorities are likely to consider in attempting to identify the intent behind such arrangements. We also design business models that reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger Anti-Kickback Statute claims.
Antitrust Laws
The antitrust laws are designed to prevent competitors from jointly fixing prices. However, competitors often work collaboratively in order to reduce the cost of health care and improve quality. To balance these competing goals, antitrust enforcement agencies have established a regulatory framework under which claims of per se price fixing can be avoided if a network of competitors (such as an ACO or clinically integrated network) is financially or clinically integrated. In this context, we evaluate the tests for financial and clinical integration that would be applied to the provider networks that we are helping to create and support, including the nature and extent of any financial risk that must be assumed to be deemed financially integrated and the types of programs that must be implemented to achieve clinical integration. However, even if a network is integrated, it is still subject to a “rule of reason” test to determine whether its activities are, on balance, pro-competitive. The key factors in the rule of reason analysis are market share and exclusivity. We focus on network size, composition and contracting policies to strengthen our partners’ position that their networks meet the rule of reason test.
Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws
The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services, including our provider-led risk adjustment solution, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
HIPAA, Privacy and Data Security Regulations
By processing data on behalf of our partners, we are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act and related state laws. We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification 
9

laws, as well as state laws regulating the processing of protected personal information, including laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of social security numbers and related identifiers.
The regulations that implement HIPAA and the HITECH Act establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities,” and their “business associates” (which includes anyone who performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce). Our partners’ health plans generally will be covered entities, and, as their business associate, they may ask us to contractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements.
HIPAA Health Care Fraud Standards
The HIPAA health care fraud statute created a class of federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters, known as the “federal health care offenses.” The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, while the HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the payment for health care benefits, items or services. Entities that are found to have aided or abetted in a violation of the HIPAA federal health care offenses are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal.
Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, as well as certain other individuals. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by federal and state governments and are administered by states under an approved plan that provides hospital and other health care benefits to qualifying individuals. As we increase our exposure to Medicare and Medicaid businesses through new and existing partners, including through our strategic alliance with Passport as well as our acquisition of Valence Health, we increase our exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and regulation of the Medicaid and Medicare programs in which we and our partners participate. We are subject to regulation by both CMS and state agencies in respect of certain services we provide relating to Medicaid and Medicare programs.
Because some of our partners are participants in governmental programs, our services have in the past and may again in the future be subject to periodic surveys and audits by governmental entities or contractors for compliance with Medicare and other standards and requirements. As a result of surveys or audits, CMS may seek premium and other refunds, prohibit us from continuing to market or enroll members in plans, exclude us from participating in one or more programs or institute other sanctions against us if we fail to comply with CMS regulations or Medicare contractual requirements.
The regulations and requirements applicable to us and other participants in Medicaid and Medicare programs are complex and subject to change. In January 2018, CMS released guidance to states on how to design and test programs that require “community engagement” as a condition to receiving Medicaid benefits. Shortly thereafter, CMS approved Kentucky’s application for a waiver to Medicaid’s rules to impose such a requirement. As a result, we expect the Kentucky waiver to reduce Passport’s membership in 2018. Consequently, this could have an impact on our revenues from Passport, which represented 20.6% of our revenue in 2017. Other states have applied for similar waivers from CMS and we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such waivers on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
Following the 2018 congressional, state and local elections, Congress and state and local legislatures may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such changes in the law, or new interpretations of existing laws, may have a significant impact on our methods and costs of doing business. Additionally, expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Going forward, we expect CMS and Congress to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the Medicare program as well as modify the terms and requirements of the program. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this Congressional or regulatory activity, either of which could adversely affect us. Similarly, we cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid and Medicare programs, nor can we predict the impact those changes will have on our business operations or financial results, but the effects could be materially adverse.
Consumer Protection Laws
Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC, Federal Communications Commission and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access.

State Privacy Laws
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, which we refer to as state privacy laws, that govern the use and disclosure of a person’s medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These state privacy laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions, such as UR, or TPA, issuance of notices of privacy practices and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state privacy laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state privacy laws, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
Other State Laws
State insurance laws require licenses for certain health plan administrative activities, including TPA licenses for the processing, handling and adjudication of health insurance claims and UR agent licenses for providing medical management services. Given the nature and scope of services that we provide to certain partners, we are required to maintain TPA and UR agent licenses and ensure that such licenses are in good standing on an annual basis. In addition, laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services. These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps. Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection, delay of claims and possible interest and regulatory penalties. The Company has also established a captive insurance company under the laws of the State of Vermont and is subject to the captive insurance laws of that state. 
Insurance subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, True Health is regulated under specific New Mexico laws and regulations and indirectly affected by other health care-related laws and regulations. State regulations mandate minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,600 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Intellectual Property
Our continued growth and success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including our Identifi® software. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business).
However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive online presence or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our intellectual property position see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks relating to our business and industry.”
Research and Development
Our research and development expenditures primarily consist of our strategic investment in enhancing the functionality and usability of our software, Identifi® and developing programs and processes to maximize care delivery efficiency and effectiveness. We also capitalize software development costs related to Identifi®. Our research and development expenditures and capitalized software development costs also include the suite of products developed by Accordion, Valence Health and Aldera.
We expensed $17.2 million, $11.1 million and $5.8 million in research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We capitalized $27.1 million, $15.0 million and $6.4 million of internal-use software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
