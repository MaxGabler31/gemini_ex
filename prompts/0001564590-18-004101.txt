Item 1. Business
Our Company
 We are a leading lodging real estate company with a diverse portfolio of market-leading hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. As of February 26, 2018, our portfolio consists of 55 premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 32,000 rooms located in prime United States (“U.S.”) and international markets with high barriers to entry. Over 85% of our rooms are luxury and upper upscale and over 95% are located in the U.S. Over 70% of our rooms are located in the central business districts of major cities and resort/conference destinations. We are focused on consistently delivering superior risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet.
 We were originally formed as a Delaware corporation in 1946 and existed as a part of one of Hilton’s business segments. On January 3, 2017, Hilton Parent completed the spin-off that resulted in our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company. The spin-off transaction, which was effected through a pro rata distribution of Park Parent stock to existing Hilton Parent stockholders, was intended to be tax-free to both Hilton and Hilton’s stockholders. As a result of the spin-off, each holder of Hilton Parent common stock on the record date of December 15, 2016 received one share of our common stock for every five shares of Hilton Parent common stock owned.
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment company (“REIT”), effective January 4, 2017. We are currently, and expect to continue to be, organized and operate in a REIT qualified manner.
 From the spin-off date, Park Intermediate Holdings LLC (our “Operating Company”), directly or indirectly, holds all of our assets and conducts all of our operations. Park Parent owns 100% of the interests in our Operating Company. 
 Our Business and Growth Strategies
 Our objective is to be the preeminent lodging REIT, focused on consistently delivering superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. We intend to pursue this objective through the following strategies: 

• | Maximizing Hotel Profitability through Active Asset Management. We are focused on continually improving the operating performance and profitability of each of our hotels and resorts through our proactive asset management efforts. We will continue to identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and drive cost efficiencies to maximize the operating performance, cash flow and value of each property. As a pure-play lodging real estate company with significant financial resources and an extensive portfolio of large, multi-use assets, including 27 hotels with 400 rooms or more, we believe our ability to implement compelling return on investment initiatives represents a significant embedded growth opportunity. These may include the expansion of meeting platforms in convention and resort markets; the upgrade or redevelopment of existing amenities, including retail platforms, food and beverage outlets, pools and other facilities; the development of vacant land into income-generating uses, including retail or mixed-use properties; or the redevelopment or optimization of underutilized spaces. We also may create value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities to ensure our assets achieve their highest and best use. Finally, we are focused on maintaining the competitive strength of our properties and adapting to evolving customer preferences by renovating properties to provide updated guestroom design, open and activated lobby areas, food and beverage and public spaces, and modernized meeting space.

• | Pursuing Growth and Diversification through Prudent Capital Allocation. We intend to leverage our scale, liquidity and mergers and acquisitions expertise to create value throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through opportunistic acquisitions, dispositions and/or corporate transactions, which we believe will enable us to further diversify our portfolio. For example, we recently sold a group of hotels located in lower growth domestic and non-core international markets that accounted for approximately $33 million of our 2017 EBITDA. We will continue to opportunistically seek to expand our presence in target markets and further diversify over time, including by acquiring hotels that are affiliated with other leading hotel brands and operators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining a Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with continued focus on optimizing our cost of capital by targeting modest leverage levels, which we seek to maintain between three- to five-times net debt (calculated as our long-term debt and our share of investments in affiliates’ debt, both excluding deferred financing costs, reduced by both our cash and cash equivalents and our restricted cash) to Adjusted EBITDA throughout the lodging cycle. We also will focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity with minimal short-dated maturities, and intend to have a mix of debt that will provide us with the flexibility to prepay when desired, dispose of assets, pursue our value enhancement strategies within our existing portfolio, and support acquisition activity. Additionally, we expect to reduce our level of secured debt over time, which will provide additional balance sheet

flexibility. Our senior management team has extensive experience managing capital structures over multiple lodging cycles and has extensive and long-standing relationships with numerous lending institutions and financial advisors to address our capital needs.

Hotel Laundry Operations
As of February 26, 2018, we own and operate three commercial laundry facilities located in Piscataway, New Jersey, Portage, Indiana, and Portland, Oregon that service approximately 40 hotels, including five of our owned hotels, and employ more than 200 full-time employees. Revenue from our hotel laundry operations accounted for less than half a percent of our consolidated revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Sustainability 
 We incorporate sustainability into our investment and asset management strategies, with a focus on minimizing environmental impact. During the acquisition of new properties, we will assess both sustainability opportunities and climate change-related risks as part of our due diligence process. During the ownership of our properties, we seek to invest in proven sustainability practices in our redevelopment projects that can enhance asset value, while also improving environmental performance. In such projects, we target specific environmental efficiency enhancements, equipment upgrades and replacements that reduce energy and water consumption 
 5


and offer appropriate returns on investment. As part of our asset management strategy, we also work with Hilton Parent to monitor environmental performance and support implementation of operational best practices. We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and minimizing our impact on the environment. Our approach to corporate citizenship is reinforced by periodic engagement with key stakeholders to understand their corporate responsibility priorities. 
 Our Principal Agreements 
 In order for us to qualify as a REIT, independent third parties must operate our hotels. Except for the Select Hotels, we lease substantially all of our hotels to our TRS lessees, which, in turn have engaged third parties to operate these hotels pursuant to management agreements. We operate the Select Hotels pursuant to franchise agreements with Hilton. We may, in the future, re-flag existing properties, acquire properties that operate under other brands and/or engage other third-party hotel managers and franchisors. 
 Below is a general overview of our management and franchise agreements. 
 Management Agreements 
 Our hotel managers, each of which is an affiliate of Hilton, control the day-to-day operations of our hotels that are subject to a management agreement. We have consultative and specified approval rights with respect to certain actions of our hotel managers, including entering into long-term or high value contracts, engaging in certain actions relating to legal proceedings, approving the operating budget, making certain capital expenditures and the hiring of certain management personnel. 
 As in our franchise agreements described below, we receive a variety of services and benefits under our management agreements with our hotel managers, including the benefit of the name, marks and system of operation of the brand, as well as centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, as well as training of personnel and payroll and accounting services. 
  Term 
 Our management agreements have terms ranging from 20 to 30 years and most allow for one or more renewal periods at the option of our hotel managers. Assuming all renewal periods are exercised by our hotel managers, the total term of our management agreements range between 30 and 70 years. 
Fees 
 Our management agreements generally contain a two-tiered fee structure, where our hotel managers receive a base management fee and an incentive management fee. The base management fee, for the majority of our hotels, is 3% of gross hotel revenues or receipts. The incentive management fee is generally 6% of a specified measure of hotel earnings calculated in accordance with the management agreement. We also pay certain service fees to our hotel managers and generally reimburse our hotel managers for salaries and wages of its employees at our U.S. hotels, as well as for other certain expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the hotel. 
Termination Events 
 Subject to certain qualifications, notice requirements and applicable cure periods, the management agreements generally are terminable by either party upon a material casualty or condemnation of the hotel or the occurrence of certain customary events of default, including, among others: the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party; the failure of either party to make a payment when due, and failure to cure such non-payment after late payment notice; or breach by either party of covenants or obligations under the management agreement. 
 Additionally, our hotel managers generally have the right to terminate the management agreement in certain situations, including the occurrence of certain actions with respect to a mortgage or our failing to complete or commence required repair after damage or destruction to the hotel, or our failure to meet minimum brand standards. For certain properties, our management agreements also allow early termination, subject to entering into a franchise agreement with an affiliated brand. If our hotel managers terminate due to our default, our hotel managers may exercise all of their rights and remedies at law or in equity. 
 Sale of a Hotel 
 Our management agreements generally provide that we cannot sell a hotel to a person who (i) does not have sufficient financial resources, (ii) is of bad moral character, (iii) is a competitor of our hotel managers or (iv) is a specially designated national or blocked 
 6


person, as set forth in the applicable management agreement. It is generally an event of default if we proceed with a sale or an assignment of the hotel’s management agreement to such a transferee, without receiving consent from our hotel managers. 
 Franchise Agreements 
 In connection with the spin-off, we entered into franchise agreements with a franchisor pursuant to which we operate the Select Hotels. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we were granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use our franchisor’s brand names, marks and system in the operation of the Select Hotels. The franchisor also may provide us with a variety of services and benefits, including centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, as well as training of personnel. In return, we are required to operate franchised hotels consistent with the applicable brand standards. The franchise agreements specify operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which we must comply, and will promote consistency across the brand by outlining standards for guest services, products, signage and furniture, fixtures and equipment, among other things. To monitor our compliance, the franchise agreements specify that we must make the hotel available for quality inspections by the franchisor. Currently, all of our franchise agreements are with Hilton.
Term 
 Our franchise agreements contain an initial term of 20 years and cannot be extended without the franchisor’s consent. 
 Fees 
 Our franchise agreements require that we pay a royalty fee on gross rooms revenue at rates ranging from 5% to 6%, plus 3% of food and beverage revenue where applicable. We must also pay certain marketing, reservation, program and other customary fees. In addition, the franchisor will have the right to require that we renovate guest rooms and public facilities from time to time to comply with then-current brand standards. 
Termination Events 
 Our franchise agreements provide for termination at the franchisor’s option upon the occurrence of certain events, including, among others: the failure to maintain brand standards; the failure to pay royalties and fees or to perform other obligations under the franchise license; bankruptcy; and abandonment of the franchise or a change of control, and in the event of such termination, we are required to pay liquidated damages. 
Spin-Off Related Agreements 
 Distribution Agreement
 We entered into a distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) with Hilton Parent regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement provided for certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by us and Hilton Parent and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Hilton Parent and us. In particular, the Distribution Agreement provided that, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Distribution Agreement:
• | all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the separated real estate business were retained by or transferred to us;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the timeshare business were retained by or transferred to HGV Parent or its subsidiaries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Hilton were retained by or transferred to Hilton Parent or its subsidiaries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) related to, arising out of or resulting from businesses of Hilton that were previously terminated or divested were allocated among the parties to the extent formerly owned or managed by or associated with such parties or their respective businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | each of Park Parent and HGV Parent assumed or retained any liabilities (including under applicable federal and state securities laws) relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Form 10 registering its common stock to be distributed by Hilton Parent in the spin-off and from any disclosure documents that offered for sale securities in transactions related to the spin-off, subject to exceptions for certain information for which Hilton Parent retained liability; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, we retained responsibility for any costs or expenses incurred by us following the distribution in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, including costs and expenses relating to legal counsel, financial advisors and accounting advisory work related to the distribution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, notwithstanding the allocation described above, we, HGV and Hilton have agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities (and related costs and expenses), which generally are not specifically attributable to any of the separated real estate business, the timeshare business or the retained business of Hilton (“Shared Contingent Liabilities”), will be apportioned among the parties according to fixed percentages of 65%, 26% and 9% for each of Hilton, us and HGV, respectively. Examples of Shared Contingent Liabilities may include uninsured losses arising from actions (including derivative actions) against current or former directors or officers of Hilton or its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the distribution date, or against current or former directors or officers of any of Hilton, HGV or us, or any of their or our respective subsidiaries, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to, the spin-offs and the distribution, subject to certain exceptions described in the Distribution Agreement. In addition, costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions may also be subject to these provisions. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton shall generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense. 
 The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.
 Employee Matters Agreement
 We entered into an employee matters agreement (“Employee Matters Agreement”) with Hilton Parent that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton Parent after the spin-off with respect to transferred employees, defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, non-qualified retirement plans, employee health and welfare benefit plans, incentive plans, equity-based awards, collective bargaining agreements and other employment, compensation and benefits-related matters. The Employee Matters Agreement provides for, among other things, the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities arising out of incentive plans, retirement plans and employee health and welfare benefit plans in which our employees participated prior to the spin-off, and continued participation by our employees in certain of Hilton’s compensation and benefit plans for a specified period of time following the spin-off. Generally, other than with respect to certain specified compensation and benefit plans and liabilities, we assumed or retained sponsorship of, and the liabilities relating to, compensation and benefit plans and employee-related liabilities relating to our current and former employees. The Employee Matters Agreement also provided that outstanding Hilton equity-based awards be equitably adjusted or converted into Park Parent awards, in connection with the spin-off. The number of shares subject to such converted awards were calculated based on adjustments to Hilton Parent equity-based awards using an applicable conversion ratio of approximately 1:1 and assumed a majority of the performance-vesting awards vest at target performance levels. Following the spin-off, our employees no longer actively participated in Hilton’s benefit plans or programs (other than on a transition basis under the Employee Matters Agreement), and we have established plans or programs for our employees as described in the Employee Matters Agreement. Effective as of January 1, 2018, the Company has implemented separate benefit plans for our employees. We have also established or maintained plans and programs outside of the United States as may be required under applicable law or pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement.
Tax Matters Agreement
 We entered into a tax matters agreement (“Tax Matters Agreement”) with Hilton Parent, HGV Parent and Hilton Domestic Operating Company that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of us, Hilton Parent and HGV Parent after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Although binding between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the IRS. We and HGV Parent have joint and several liability with Hilton Parent to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we were part of that group. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we bear responsibility, and each party has agreed to indemnify the other against any amounts for which they are not responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free. In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party’s stock). The parties share responsibility in accordance with sharing percentages for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a particular party.
 8


The Tax Matters Agreement also provides for certain covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue strategic or other transactions that otherwise could maximize the value of our business, including, for two years after the spin-off: 
  
• | engaging in any transaction involving the acquisition of shares of Park Parent stock or in certain issuances of shares of Park Parent stock (other than with respect to the distribution of our estimated share of C corporation earnings and profits attributable to the period prior to spin-off (“E&P Dividend”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | merging or consolidating with any other person or dissolving or liquidating in whole or in part;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selling or otherwise disposing of, or allowing the sale or other disposition of, more than 35% of our consolidated gross or net assets; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repurchasing our shares, except in certain circumstances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
These strategic and other transactions may be allowed within the two-year timeframe in the event that the IRS has granted a favorable ruling to us or in the event that we have received an opinion from a tax advisor that we can take such actions without adversely affecting the tax-free status of the spin-off and related transactions. 
 Transition Services Agreement
 We entered into a transition services agreement (“TSA”) with Hilton Parent to provide us with certain services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the distribution. 
 The services that Hilton provided include certain finance, information technology, human resources and compensation, facilities, legal and compliance and other services. We paid Hilton Parent for such services utilized at agreed amounts as set forth in the TSA. In addition, for a term set forth in the TSA, we and Hilton Parent may mutually agree on additional services to be provided by Hilton to us that were provided to us by Hilton prior to the distribution but were omitted from the TSA at pricing based on market rates that are reasonably agreed by the parties.
 Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreements 
 On October 24, 2016, Hilton Parent, The Blackstone Group L.P. and its affiliates (“Blackstone”) and HNA Tourism Group Company Limited (“HNA”) announced that affiliates of Blackstone agreed to sell 247,500,000 shares of common stock of Hilton Parent to HNA, representing approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hilton Parent, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between HNA and Blackstone (“Sale”). Pursuant to that stock purchase agreement, as the Sale closed after the record date of the spin-off, the Sale also included the shares of common stock of HGV Parent and Park Parent received by Blackstone with respect to the shares of common stock of the Hilton Parent being sold to HNA. The Sale closed on March 15, 2017, resulting in HNA acquiring 53,651,453 shares of Park Parent’s common stock at approximately $25.45 per share. In connection with the Sale, we entered into a stockholders’ agreement and a registration rights agreement with HNA, summarized below.
 We also previously entered into a registration rights agreement and a stockholders’ agreement with Blackstone. In accordance with the registration rights agreement with Blackstone, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 5, 2017. The Blackstone Selling Stockholders named in our Form S-11 sold 15.0 million shares of Park Parent’s common stock in June 2017 and an additional 16.8 million shares in December 2017. As a result of such sales, the stockholder agreement with Blackstone was terminated in accordance with its terms. The Company will no longer have any obligations under the registration rights agreement with Blackstone once Blackstone no longer owns any of our securities (other than those that can be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or 145 of the Securities Act (or similar provisions) without limitation thereunder on volume or manner of sale).
 HNA Stockholders Agreement 
 In connection with the Sale, we entered into a stockholders agreement with HNA (and with HNA Group Co., Ltd. for purposes of the standstill provision only) that became effective upon the closing of the Sale. 
 Directors. Under the HNA stockholders agreement, for so long as HNA beneficially owns at least 15% of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to designate two directors to our board of directors, only one of which may be affiliated with HNA (but not its hospitality business, unless such condition is waived) and the other of which must meet the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) with respect to our company and not have been, for two years, an employee, director or officer of, or consultant to, HNA or any of its affiliates. Each of HNA’s director designees must be reasonably satisfactory to our nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, so long as HNA owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, HNA will have the right to designate an additional independent director to fill each third additional director seat above 11 directors; for example, if we were to increase the size of our board of directors in the future to 14, HNA would have the right to designate an 
 9


independent director as the 14th member of the board of directors. HNA’s right to designate directors declines to one director when HNA’s ownership falls below 15% of our outstanding common stock and such right terminates when HNA’s ownership falls below 5% of our outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Each independent designee will be entitled to serve on at least one standing committee of the board of directors, as determined by the nominating and corporate governance committee. 
 Voting Requirements. The HNA stockholders agreement generally requires HNA to vote all of its shares in excess of 15% of our total outstanding shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted on all matters, except as follows: (i) in uncontested elections of directors, HNA is required to vote all of its shares either in favor of the board’s nominees or all of its shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted; (ii) in contested elections of directors, HNA is required to vote all of its shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted; (iii) for two years after the closing of the Sale, in third party acquisitions of our company in which both (x) shares of our common stock are exchanged for or are converted into the right to receive (A) solely cash or (B) a mixture of cash and stock of a person other than an HNA entity in which the value of the cash portion of the aggregate consideration is 60% or more of the value of the aggregate consideration and (y) the value of the consideration to be received per share of common stock is less than or equal to a reference price per share of our common stock calculated in accordance with the HNA stockholders agreement, HNA may vote all of its shares as it chooses; (iv) for any acquisition of our company other than an acquisition described in (iii) above or an acquisition by HNA, HNA will vote all of its shares in excess of 15% of our total outstanding shares in proportion to the manner in which non-HNA holders vote their shares; and (v) in the case of any charter or bylaw amendment which adversely affects HNA disproportionally as compared to other stockholders, an issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding shares (other than for an acquisition) at a below-market price, or an acquisition of our company by HNA, HNA may vote all of its shares as it chooses. In a third party tender offer, HNA will be required to tender its shares in excess of 15% of our total outstanding shares in the same proportion as shares held by non-HNA holders are tendered. 
 Certain Transfers and Right of First Refusal. The stockholder agreement does not generally restrict transfers of shares by HNA, except that if HNA transfers any of its shares to any HNA affiliate, such HNA affiliate must agree to be bound by the terms of the HNA stockholders agreement. In addition, if we propose to issue new equity securities for cash in an offering that is not an underwritten public offering or an offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, HNA will have a right of first refusal over its pro rata portion of such issuance, measured based on HNA’s ownership percentage (which shall be capped at 25% for purposes of the right of first refusal) in us at such time. 
 Standstill. The HNA stockholders agreement requires HNA and its affiliates not to: acquire, offer or agree to acquire, any beneficial interest in us, subject to certain exceptions; make any public announcement or public offer with respect to any merger, business combination or other similar transaction involving us (except when our board of directors recommends or approves such transaction); make or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” to vote or seek to influence voting of securities in a manner inconsistent with our board’s recommendation; seek election or removal of any director other than HNA designees or otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to control or influence our company; call a meeting of stockholders; participate in a “group” regarding our equity securities; act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence our management or policies; knowingly assist or encourage, or enter into any discussions or agreements with any third party, in connection with any of the foregoing; publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; provide any financing for a purchase of our equity securities or assets, subject to certain exceptions; or take any actions that HNA knows or would reasonably be expected to know would require us to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of an acquisition. HNA will not be prohibited from: (i) transferring shares of our stock to HNA affiliates; (ii) purchasing shares of our stock pursuant to its right of first refusal over its pro rata portion of newly issued equity securities; (iii) making a non-public, confidential acquisition proposal to our board of directors; or (iv) after a public announcement of a definitive agreement for the acquisition of our company by a third party, making a publicly announced alternative acquisition proposal for all of our outstanding shares, which, if a tender or exchange offer, must be on the same terms for all such shares and include a non-waivable condition that a majority of the shares held by non-HNA holders are tendered into such offer. To the extent HNA’s ownership percentage falls below 25% of our total outstanding shares (or a lower percentage that results from sales of shares by HNA) as a result of issuances by us, HNA may purchase our shares in the open market so as to maintain its ownership percentage at 25% (or such lower percentage that results from sales of shares by HNA). 
HNA Registration Rights Agreements 
 In connection with the Sale, we entered into a registration rights agreement with HNA that became effective upon the closing of the Sale. The HNA registration rights agreement provides that, beginning two years after the closing of the Sale, HNA will have customary “demand” and “piggyback” registration rights. The registration rights agreement also will require us to pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holder against certain liabilities under the Securities Act.

 We (or certain joint ventures in which we own an interest) are also party to certain leases for facilities related to certain hotels owned by us (or such joint ventures), including the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Las Vegas Airport, the Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort, the Hilton Waikoloa Village, the Embassy Suites by Hilton Alexandria Old Town, the Hilton New Orleans Riverside and the New York Hilton Midtown. These leases are all triple net leases or modified triple net leases and relate to facilities related to such hotels, including leases for parking, restaurant space, dock space or other hotel-related uses. 
 Competition 
 The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests on the basis of several factors, including the attractiveness of the facility, location, level of service, quality of accommodations, amenities, food and beverage options and outlets, public and meeting spaces and other guest services, consistency of service, room rate, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands primarily in the upper upscale chain scale segments. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and RevPAR of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. We believe our hotels enjoy certain competitive advantages as a result of being flagged with globally recognized brands, including access to centralized reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, strong hotel management expertise and guest loyalty programs. 
 Our principal competitors include hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including other lodging REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as select-service hotels or independently managed hotels, during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity investors, institutional pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and numerous local, regional and national owners, including franchisors, in each of 
 11


our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers. 
 Seasonality 
 The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause fluctuations in our hotel rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. The periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. 
Cyclicality 
 The lodging industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given segments of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners of hotel properties. As a result, in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. 
Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after January 26, 1993; public accommodations built before January 26, 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is “readily achievable.” The failure of a property to comply with the ADA could result in injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. Any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures could result in reputational harm or otherwise materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations. 
 In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. As an operator of the Select Hotels we are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations. 
 As a global owner of hotels, we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including employment laws and practices, privacy laws and tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. including taxation of REIT income and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences. 
 In addition, our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, 
 12


property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. In addition to our hotel accommodations, we operate certain laundry facilities. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our properties include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. We have implemented an on-going operations and maintenance plan that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We believe that we are organized in conformity with, and operate in a manner that will allow us to elect to be taxed as, a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our tax year ended December 31, 2017, and we expect to continue to be organized and operate so as to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To the extent we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on taxable income generated by our REIT activities that we distribute to our stockholders. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. Refer to “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.” 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property, including business interruption, terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our hotels. Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles. Our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 520 employees, including 84 corporate employees, 189 employees of the Select Hotels, and 247 employees of our hotel laundry operations. This number does not include the hotel employees of certain of our hotels located outside of the United States, who, while legally our employees, are under the direct supervision and control of our third-party hotel managers. Our hotel managers are generally responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels, other than the Select Hotels. Although we generally do not manage employees at our hotels (other than the Select Hotels), we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor. We believe relations are positive between our third-party hotel managers, and their employees. For a discussion of these relationships, refer to “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor, which could increase our operating costs, reduce flexibility of our hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotels and could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”
