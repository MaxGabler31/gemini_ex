On May 21, 2018, the Company, entered into an Exclusive Oversea Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Foshan Wanshunbao Technology Co., Ltd. (“Wanshunbao”), a mainland China based company. According to the Agreement, Wanshunbao wishes to promote and develop oversea sales channels for its unique “Mysteries Fruit” tea and related products worldwide. The Company is appointed as Wanshunbao’s exclusive distributor to market and sell the “Mysteries Fruit” herbal tea and related products in geographic areas covers all over the world except mainland China.
 
In the past 20 years, Wangshunbao has dedicated to improve its R&D, and production of the unique “Mysteries Fruit” and related supplemental products, currently, Wangshunbao has developed a leading role in this industry, and is in the process of expanding its business model worldwide to a 10 billion RMB ($1,500,000,000) industry chain. To achieve that goal, Wangshunbao’s management team had been actively seeking a qualified international distributor and business partner to execute its expansion plan.
 
The Company’s management team was invited to Foshan, China in early May, 2018 to visit Wangshunbao and its production facilities, upon extensive discussion and negotiation, the Company was granted with exclusive distribution rights worldwide for “Mysteries Fruit” tea and related products. The Company believes by introducing “Mysteries Fruit” products to oversee consumers would have a huge beneficial effect; and the management is confident about this business opportunity, as the Company’s core team members all have been in health and supplemental related industry for over 20 years, and has substantial nutrient products sales experiences and marketing channels. The Company is currently conducting preliminary sales campaigns for “Mysteries Fruit” products.
 
The Company is also planning to make additional acquisitions. Mike Wang has approached several health related companies in China and met the management of potential acquisition targets. Rapid economic advances in China in the last 30 years have greatly improved the living standards in China. This in turn brings demand in healthcare products and services. The Company feels strongly that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to our stockholders.
 
As inherent with any new business development, there are risks involved in such endeavors. For all the healthcare related businesses afore-mentioned, the Company is evaluating what kind of risks we are facing. The Company notices that vitamin and nutrition supplement business is a highly competitive market and faces multiple regulatory monitoring. The compliance challenge is constant. Regarding proton treatment sales, the device is very expensive and for such large ticket item, the procurement process can be long and arduous. The sale of cardio vascular device also has its challenges. The device is not well known and the acceptance of the use requires major efforts in educating not only the medical professionals but also consumers. This would demand financial as well as other resources. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition efforts, any potential results, if any, are still not certain.
 
Employees and Outside Services
 
The Company's only employee at the present time is its sole executive officer and director, who devotes full time to the affairs of the Company.  Remaining administrative (non-policy making) officers and consultants and technical personnel such as marketing specialists are being compensated as independent contractors.  We pay these persons on a contract basis as required.
