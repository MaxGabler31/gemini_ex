ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
DuPont was founded in 1802 and was incorporated in Delaware in 1915. Today, DuPont is helping customers find solutions to capitalize on areas of growing global demand — enabling more, safer, nutritious food; creating high-performance, cost-effective and energy efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly delivering renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. Total worldwide employment at December 31, 2017 was about 44,000 people. The company has subsidiaries in about 90 countries worldwide and manufacturing operations in about 50 countries. The percentage of consolidated net sales made to customers outside the United States of America (U.S.) was 70 percent during the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and 56 percent during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the location of the company's sales and property.
DowDuPont Merger of Equals
DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont") was formed on December 9, 2015 to effect an all-stock, merger of equals strategic combination between The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow") and DuPont (the "Merger Transaction"). On August 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm ET, (the "Merger Effectiveness Time") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), Dow and DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont ("Mergers") and, as a result of the Mergers, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the "Merger"). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement. DowDuPont intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and materials science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the "Intended Business Separations"). DowDuPont anticipates materials science separating by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and expects agriculture and specialty products to separate by June 1, 2019. 
Upon completion of the Merger, (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.30 per share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effectiveness Time, of the company (the “DuPont Common Stock”) was converted into the right to receive 1.2820 fully paid and non-assessable shares of DowDuPont common stock, par value $0.01 per share, ("DowDuPont Common Stock"), in addition to cash in lieu of any fractional shares of DowDuPont Common Stock, and (ii) each share of DuPont Preferred Stock—$4.50 Series and DuPont Preferred Stock—$3.50 Series (collectively, the “DuPont Preferred Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effectiveness Time remains issued and outstanding and was unaffected by the Mergers.
As a condition of the regulatory approval for the Merger Transaction, the company was required to divest certain assets related to its Crop Protection business and research and development ("R&D") organization, specifically the company’s Cereal Broadleaf Herbicides and Chewing Insecticides portfolios, including Rynaxypyr®, Cyazypyr® , and Indoxacarb as well as the Crop Protection R&D pipeline and organization, excluding seed treatment, nematicides, and late-stage R&D programs (the "Divested Ag Business"). On March 31, 2017, the company entered into a definitive agreement (the "FMC Transaction Agreement") with FMC Corporation ("FMC"). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement, and effective upon the closing of the transaction on November 1, 2017, FMC acquired the Divested Ag Business that DuPont was required to divest in order to obtain European Commission ("EC") approval for the Merger Transaction, and DuPont acquired certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment, excluding its Omega-3 products (the "H&N Business") (collectively, the "FMC Transactions"). See Note 3 and Note 4 for further information regarding the acquisition and divestiture, respectively. The assets and liabilities related to the Divested Ag Business for all periods are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The sale of the Divested Ag Business meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. 
Basis of Presentation
For purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger and DuPont's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the Merger Effectiveness Time. In connection with the Merger and the related accounting determination, DuPont has elected to apply push-down accounting and reflect in its financial statements, the fair value of its assets and liabilities. DuPont's Consolidated Financial Statements for periods following the close of the Merger are labeled “Successor” and reflect DowDuPont’s basis in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of DuPont. All periods prior to the closing of the Merger reflect the historical accounting basis in DuPont's assets and liabilities and are labeled “Predecessor.” The Consolidated Financial Statements and Footnotes include a black line division between the columns titled "Predecessor" and "Successor" to signify that the amounts shown for the periods prior to and following the Merger are not comparable. See Note 3 for additional information on the Merger.

Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted.  The Act reduces the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. At December 31, 2017, the company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a net benefit in provision for taxes on continuing operations of $2,001 million, which consisted of a provisional net benefit of $2,716 million due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, partially offset by a provisional charge of $715 million due to the transition tax. Additional details related to The Act can be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 21 of this report and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program
In September and November 2017, DowDuPont and the company approved post-merger restructuring actions to achieve targeted cost synergies under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The plan is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations.  Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, DuPont expects to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of $430 million to $600 million, comprised of approximately $320 million to $360 million of severance and related benefits costs; $110 million to $140 million of costs related to contract terminations; and up to $100 million of asset related charges. The Synergy Program includes certain asset actions, including strategic decisions regarding the cellulosic biofuel unit reflected in the preliminary fair value measurement of DuPont’s assets as of the merger date. Current estimated total pre-tax restructuring charges could be impacted by future adjustments to the preliminary fair value of DuPont’s assets.
For the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $153 million, contract termination costs of $31 million and asset-related charges of $3 million. The charge for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 was recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Substantially all of the remaining restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in 2018 and the related actions, including employee separations, associated with this plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2019. 
Future cash payments related to this program are anticipated to be approximately $410 million to $480 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract termination costs. It is possible that additional charges and future cash payments could occur in relation to the restructuring actions. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within DowDuPont's cost synergy commitment of $3.3 billion associated with the Merger Transaction. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 21 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2017 Restructuring Program
During the first quarter 2017, DuPont committed to take actions to improve plant productivity and better position its product lines for productivity and growth before and after the anticipated closing of the Merger Transaction (the "2017 restructuring program"). In connection with these actions, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $313 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 ("Predecessor" period) recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charge is comprised of $279 million of asset-related charges and $34 million in severance and related benefit costs. The charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina. The asset-related charges mainly consist of accelerated depreciation associated with the closure. The actions associated with this plan are substantially complete. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within the targeted cost synergies associated with the Merger Transaction. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 22 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all product lines and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating product lines and aligning staff functions more closely with them.  In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $783 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $641 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. The restructuring actions associated with the charge are substantially complete and the plan delivered the target cost reductions in 2016 versus 2015. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 22 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Acquisition of Granular, Inc.
On August 31, 2017, the company acquired Granular, Inc., a leading provider of software and analytics tools that help farms improve efficiency, profitability, and sustainability.  The purchase price was approximately $250 million and was primarily allocated to goodwill, developed technology and customer relationships.
Divestiture of Food Safety Diagnostic Business
In February 2017, the company completed the sale of the global food safety diagnostic business to Hygiena LLC.  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $162 million ($86 million net of tax). The gain was recorded in sundry income - net in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. 
Settlement of PFOA MDL
As previously reported, approximately 3,550 lawsuits have been filed in various federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia alleging personal injury from exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt ("PFOA"), in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of PFOA at the Washington Works' plant outside Parkersburg, West Virginia.  The plant operating units involved in the allegations are owned and operated by The Chemours Company ("Chemours").  These personal injury lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the "MDL"). In February 2017, DuPont and plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to a settlement in principle of the MDL; the parties executed the definitive settlement agreements in March 2017. The total settlement amount is $670.7 million in cash, half of which was paid by Chemours and half by DuPont. The settlement was entered into solely by way of compromise and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by DuPont or Chemours. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $335 million ($214 million net of tax) to (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 for the remainder of the settlement not subject to indemnification by Chemours. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Spin-off of Performance Chemicals
On July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company. In connection with the separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), the results of operations of its former Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Information
Effective with the Merger, DuPont’s business activities are components of its parent company’s business operations. DuPont’s business activities, including the assessment of performance and allocation of resources, are reviewed and managed by DowDuPont. Information used by the chief operating decision maker of DuPont relates to the company in its entirety. Accordingly, there are no separate reportable business segments for DuPont under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 “Segment Reporting” and DuPont's business results are reported in this Form 10-K as a single operating segment. Prior year's segment information has been made to conform to the current presentation.

The following are the company's major commodities, raw materials and supplies: 
Corn and soybean seeds, soy white flakes, soybean, adipic acid, hexamethylene diamine, meta-phenylene diamine, terephthaloyl chloride, thermoplastic polyester elastomer and thermoplastic copolyester elastomer.
Competition
As a science and technology based company, DuPont competes on a variety of factors such as product quality and performance or specifications, continuity of supply, price, customer service and breadth of product line, depending on the characteristics of the particular market involved and the product or service provided. The company competes globally with other seed and plant biotechnology companies on the basis of technology and trait leadership, price, quality and cost competitiveness. Key competitors for the company's agriculture product line include BASF, Bayer, Monsanto and Syngenta, as well as regional seed companies.
Distribution
Most products are marketed primarily through the company's sales organization, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers and farmers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world. In the corn and soybean markets of the U.S. Corn Belt, the company sells Pioneer® brand products primarily through a specialized force of independent sales representatives. Outside of North America, the company markets Pioneer® brand products primarily through a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures and independent producer-distributors. 
Seasonality
Sales of the company's agriculture product line are affected by the seasonality of global agriculture markets and weather patterns. Sales and earnings performance are significantly stronger in the first versus second half of the year, reflecting the northern hemisphere planting season. As a result of this seasonality, the agriculture product line inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables for seeds are at a low point at year-end and increase through the northern hemisphere selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS, continued

Backlog 
In general, the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property
Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make DuPont products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment.
Patents & Trademarks: DuPont continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2017, the company owned about 6,500 active U.S. patents and about 9,900 active patents outside of the U.S., which reflects the impact of the FMC Transactions. Information on the importance of intellectual property rights to the company’s agriculture product line is included in the Research and Development discussion below.
Remaining life of granted patents owned as of December 31, 2017:

 | U.S. | Other Countries
Within 5 years | 1,700 | | 2,800
6 to 10 years | 1,900 | | 4,400
11 to 16 years | 2,400 | | 2,600
16 to 20 years | 500 | | 100 
Total | 6,500 | | 9,900

In addition to its owned patents, the company owns over 7,000 patent applications.
The company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. 
Research and Development
DuPont’s investment in research and development ("R&D") was $473 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $1,064 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, $1,502 million in 2016 and $1,735 million in 2015. DuPont conducts R&D activities to renew its portfolio, create new product lines, and transform markets to deliver results in the short, mid and long term. The company protects its R&D investment through its intellectual property strategy.  See discussion under “Intellectual Property” above.
R&D expense related to the agriculture product line accounted for 53 percent and 56 percent of the company's total research and development expense for the periods from January 1 through August 31, 2017 and September 1 through December 31, 2017, respectively. R&D for the agriculture product line requires long-term commitment of resources, extensive regulatory efforts and collaborations, partnerships and business arrangements to successfully bring products to market. To protect its investment, the company employs the use of patents covering germplasm and native and biotechnology traits in accordance with country laws. The company holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business. The biotechnology traits licensed by the company from third parties are contained in a variety of Pioneer seeds, including corn hybrids and soybean varieties. The majority of Pioneer’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long-term licenses.
