Item 1. Business
Business Overview 
Overview
Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. was founded by Robert Pera in 2005. The Company sells equipment, and provides the related software platforms, worldwide through a network of over 100 distributors and on-line retailers. The Company has a very broad installed base with over 70 million devices sold in over 200 countries and territories around the world, since inception. Ubiquiti aims to connect everyone to everything, everywhere. 
The Company develops technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and next-generation consumer electronics for home and personal use. We categorize our solutions in to three main categories: high performance networking technology for service providers, enterprises and consumers. 
The majority of the Company’s resources consist of entrepreneurial and de-centralized research and development ("R&D"). Ubiquiti does not employ a traditional direct sales force, but instead drives brand awareness through online reviews and publications, its website, its distributors and the company’s user community where customers can interface directly with R&D, marketing, and support. Our technology platforms were designed from the ground up with a focus on delivering highly-advanced and easily deployable solutions that appeal to a global customer base in underserved and underpenetrated markets. Our differentiated business model, we believe, has enabled us to break down traditional barriers such as high product and 
4

network deployment costs, and offer solutions with disruptive price-performance characteristics. We strive to offer solutions that provide an ecosystem which simplifies the user's experience and the deployment process of additional hardware.
The Company maintains an industry leading financial profile by leveraging its unique business model. This differentiated business model, combined with our innovative, proprietary technologies, has resulted in an attractive alternative to traditional high touch, high cost providers, allowing us to advance the market adoption of our platforms for ubiquitous connectivity. As a result, our technology has enabled hundreds of millions of people throughout the world to stay connected.
We offer a broad and expanding portfolio of networking products and solutions for operator-owners of wireless internet services (WISP's), enterprises and smart homes. Our operator-owner service provider product platforms provide carrier-class network infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems and routing and the related software for WISP's to easily control, track and bill their customers. Our enterprise product platforms provide wireless LAN (WLAN) infrastructure, video surveillance products, switching and routing solutions, security gateways, and other complimentary WLAN products along with a unique software platform, which enables users to control their network from one simple, easy to use software interface. Our consumer products, sold under the Ubiquiti Labs brand name, are targeted to the smart home and highly connected consumers. We believe that our products are highly differentiated due to our proprietary software protocol innovation, firmware expertise, and hardware design capabilities. This differentiation allows our portfolio to meet the demanding performance requirements of video, voice and data applications at prices that are a fraction of those offered by our competitors.
As a core part of our strategy, we have developed a differentiated business model for marketing and selling high volumes of carrier and enterprise-class communications platforms. Our business model is driven by a large, growing and highly engaged community of service providers, distributors, value added resellers, systems integrators and corporate IT professionals, which we refer to as the Ubiquiti Community. The Ubiquiti Community is a one element of our business strategy as it enables us to drive:

• | Rapid customer and community driven product development. We have an active, loyal community built from our customers that we believe is a sustainable competitive advantage. Our solutions benefit from the active engagement between the Ubiquiti Community and our development engineers throughout the product development cycle, which eliminates long and expensive multistep internal processes and results in rapid introduction and adoption of our products. This approach significantly reduces our development costs and time to market.


• | Scalable sales and marketing model. We do not maintain the traditional direct sales force as compared to some of our competitors, but instead utilize digital marketing and the Ubiquiti Community to drive market awareness and demand for our products and solutions. We believe this community-propagated viral marketing enables us to reach underserved and underpenetrated markets far more efficiently and cost-effectively than is possible through traditional sales models. Leveraging the information transparency of the Internet allows customers to research, evaluate and validate our solutions with the Ubiquiti Community and via third party web sites. This allows us to operate a scalable sales and marketing model and effectively create awareness of our brand and products.

By reducing the cost of development, sales, marketing and support we are able to offer innovative solutions with disruptive price performance characteristics to our customers.
We operate our business as one reportable and operating segment. Further information regarding Segments can be found in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revenues were $1,016.9 million, $865.3 million and $666.4 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We reported net income of $196.3 million, $257.5 million and $213.6 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more financial information. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 as fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
The Ubiquiti Community
We established the Ubiquiti forum, wiki and newsletter to foster a large, growing and engaged online community of service providers and distributors, customers and employees among others. The Ubiquiti Community facilitates rapid introductions and development of customer-oriented products. The Ubiquiti Community provides best practices, advice, troubleshooting and product feedback. It also acts as a source of product support and marketing. 
Industry Overview
Internet traffic worldwide has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by an increase in the number of users, increasing mobility of those users and high bandwidth applications, such as video, audio, cloud-based applications, online gaming and social networking. According to Cisco Visual Networking Index, global Internet protocol, or IP, traffic is expected to increase from 96 exabytes per month in 2016 to 278 exabytes per month in 2021, representing an approximate 24% compound annual growth 
5

rate, or CAGR, over that period. Additionally, it is estimated that there will be 3.5 networked devices per capita connected to IP networks in 2021, up from 2.3 networked devices per capita in 2016. Wired networking solutions have traditionally been used to address increasing consumer and enterprise bandwidth needs. However, the high initial capital requirements and ongoing operating costs and long market lead times associated with building and installing infrastructure for wired networks has severely limited the widespread deployment of these networks in underserved and underpenetrated markets. Wireless networks have emerged as an attractive alternative for addressing the broadband access needs of underserved and underpenetrated markets in both emerging and developed countries.
Underserved and underpenetrated markets. There is a significant market opportunity in both emerging and developed economies. In “unconnected” emerging markets, the lack of an established network infrastructure and the high initial deployment costs associated with traditional wired network infrastructure build-outs have encouraged adoption of wireless networking infrastructure. In “under-connected” markets, bandwidth demand exceeds either the available capacity from existing infrastructure or the affordable supply of new infrastructure, resulting in an attractive market opportunity for wireless systems to bolster connectivity. Additionally, we believe our products offer customers a reliable, scalable and customizable wireless networks and whose primary buying criterion is based on price-performance characteristics.
Increasing use of the unlicensed spectrum. In the absence of affordable broadband access in the licensed spectrum, the number of users of the unlicensed RF spectrum has increased for communications equipment, as well as consumer devices such as cordless phones, baby monitors and microwave ovens. This increasing use of unlicensed RF spectrum has made providing high quality wireless networking more challenging due to increasing congestion in the unlicensed spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission continues to regulate use of unlicensed RF spectrum. Existing and contemplated regulations may affect the cost and/or effectiveness of products that rely on access to such unlicensed RF spectrum.
Government incentives for broadband access. Governments around the world are increasingly taking both regulatory and financial steps to expand access to broadband networks and increase availability of advanced broadband services to consumers and businesses.
Challenges facing incumbent solutions. To provide robust wireless networks that meet the price-performance needs of service providers and enterprises, vendors of wireless networking solutions must address the problems facing incumbent solutions:

• | Poor performance. To deliver high performance, wireless networking solutions need to satisfy diverse performance requirements for video, voice and data. The challenges of operating in the unlicensed RF spectrum, including spectrum noise and interference resulting from the proliferation of devices, often result in difficulty establishing network connections and unreliable or poor performance. Additionally, the performance and reliability of existing wireless networking solutions decline rapidly as the number of subscribers and range of service delivery increases. Lack of hardware and software integration between products, technologies and vendor devices can diminish network performance significantly and increase the complexity of network management, integration and expansion.


• | High cost of ownership. Existing alternative solutions, such as fiber-to-the-premises, cable, digital subscriber line, or DSL, worldwide interoperability for microwave access, or WiMAX, LTE and traditional backhaul, provide high capacity, high performance broadband access; however, these solutions can be extremely costly, and often do not meet the demanding price-performance requirements of underserved markets.


• | Complexity. Existing alternative solutions are often difficult to deploy and manage and require skilled employees or high cost consultants to install and operate. In addition, existing enterprise solutions often offer a large variety of features and functionalities that enterprise customers may find overwhelming or unnecessary.


• | Lack of product support and customer-driven features. Product support and feedback for alternative suppliers’ wireless networking solutions are often costly and ineffective. Existing wireless solutions are not accompanied by dynamic product support to assist customers in efficiently setting up and troubleshooting their networks. Additionally, alternative suppliers generally lack an effective mechanism to communicate with their end-users and incorporate feedback from usage into product roadmaps.

Market opportunity. Existing service provider wireless networking technologies have been developed to satisfy the increasing demand for broadband access, support mobility and provide the performance and reliability demanded by customers. However, these existing solutions based upon wired, satellite or cellular technologies, often fail to meet the price-performance requirements of fixed wireless networking in emerging markets, rural markets, or price-sensitive markets, which in turn has led to low penetration of wireless broadband access and large populations of unaddressed users in these areas. Similarly, passive optical networking (PON) has been utilized globally to improve internet connectivity but it hasn’t previously been available at economically viable pricing to very large underserved populations. An economically viable solution utilizing fiber, or other wireless technology, would further expand use of the internet to these populations. 
Within the enterprise, existing WLAN deployments are often relatively complex and costly, providing customers with a large number of non-critical features and functionalities at a high cost. Given the growth in Internet connected devices, and the 
6

consumer’s desire for constant connectivity, there exists growing demand for WLAN solutions that provide critical features at significantly lower cost than existing solutions.

We offer a consumer product platform, called AmpliFi, which is a Wi-Fi system solution designed to serve the demands of the modern connected home. We continue to explore consumer related market opportunities and have research and development teams focused on new consumer related solutions.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our products. Our engineering team has deep expertise and experience in networking and antenna design, and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with network architecture and operation. We have developed and intend to continue to develop our technology in part by operating with a relatively flat reporting structure that relies on individual contributors or small development teams to develop, test and obtain feedback for our products. Our products and solutions benefit from the active engagement between the Ubiquiti Community and our research and development personnel throughout the product development cycle, resulting in rapid introduction and adoption of new products. Our research and development personnel evaluate the input from service providers, IT professionals and enterprises and respond to their needs by modifying our products or developing new products based on the input received.
As of June 30, 2018, our research and development team consisted of 509 full time equivalent employees, including contractors, located in the United States, Taiwan, China, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia and elsewhere. Our research and development operations work on product development of new products and new versions of existing products. Our research and development expenses were $74.3 million, $69.1 million and $57.8 million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. We expect that the number of our research and development personnel will increase over time and that our research and development expenses will also increase.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use contract manufacturers, primarily located in China, to manufacture our products. Our relationships with contract manufacturers allow us to conserve working capital, reduce manufacturing costs and minimize delivery lead times while maintaining high product quality and the ability to scale quickly to handle increased order volume. Over the long term, our contract manufacturers are not required to manufacture our products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. We expect that it would take approximately three to six months to transition manufacturing, quality assurance and shipping services to new providers.
We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products, and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. We and our contract manufacturers rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers. The majority of our product revenues are dependent upon the sale of products that incorporate components from Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. ("Qualcomm Atheros"). We are party to a non-exclusive license agreement with Qualcomm Atheros whereby we license certain technology that we incorporate into our products. This agreement automatically renews for successive one year periods unless the agreement is terminated by written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the end of its then-current term. The Company has not received a termination notice as of the date of this Report. We depend on this license agreement to modify and replace firmware that Qualcomm Atheros provides with the chipsets with our proprietary firmware. While our agreement with Qualcomm Atheros remains effective, in accordance with the current terms of the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement without cause at the end of the annual contract term.
We do not stockpile sufficient chipsets to cover the time it would take to re-engineer our products to replace the Qualcomm Atheros chipsets which comprise the raw materials for our product offerings. If we need to seek a suitable second source for Qualcomm Atheros in our products, there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully source our chipsets on suitable terms, if at all. In any event, our use of chipsets from multiple sources may require us to significantly modify our designs and manufacturing processes to accommodate these different chipsets.
Tariffs
8

In June 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced new proposed tariffs for certain products imported from China. It is expected that these tariffs will be finalized after a public comment period ending in early September 2018. The majority of our products are among the products to be subject to the additional tariffs. If the tariffs are implemented and we are unable to pass the cost on to our customers, and/or execute on our plans to mitigate the tariffs, it would have a material impact our profitability and results of operations.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products and solutions globally to service providers and enterprises primarily through our extensive network of distributors, and, to a lesser extent, direct customers. During fiscal 2018, we sold our products to over 100 distributors and direct customers (collectively, “customers”) in over 60 countries. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, one customer in each period represented 11% of our revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in fiscal 2016. Refer to Note 12 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
A majority of our sales are made to distributors outside the United States and we anticipate that non-U.S. sales will continue to be a significant portion of our revenues. We do not have any visibility on the location or extent of purchases of our products by individual network operators and service providers from our distributors. For further discussion of the risks associated with foreign operations, see “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our International Operations"
Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 15 of this Form 10-K. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15.
Backlog
Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Some orders remain in backlog due to concerns about the credit worthiness of the customer and/or delivery held due to inventory channel. We do not believe our backlog information is a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue of financial performance.
Competition
The markets for networking solutions for service providers, enterprise WLAN, video surveillance, microwave backhaul and machine-to-machine communications technology are highly competitive and are influenced by the following competitive factors, among others:

• | total cost of ownership and return on investment associated with the solutions;


• | simplicity of deployment and use of the solutions;


• | ability to rapidly develop high performance integrated solutions;


• | reliability and scalability of the solutions;


• | market awareness of a particular brand;


• | ability to provide secure access to wireless networks;


• | ability to offer a suite of products and solutions;


• | ability to allow centralized management of the solutions; and


• | ability to provide quality product support.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We have been successful in rapidly developing high performance integrated solutions because we use individual contributors and small, experienced development teams that focus on the key needs of underserved and underpenetrated markets. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the price-performance characteristics demanded by our customers to achieve a strong overall return on their investment. Our products are designed to operate in growing networks without degradation in performance or operational complexity.
In the backhaul market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Ceragon Networks, DragonWave, Mikrotîkls, Mimosa, SAF Tehnika and Trango. In the CPE market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Mikrotîkls, Ruckus Wireless (Arris) and TP-LINK Technologies. In the antenna market, we primarily compete with PCTEL, ARC, ITELITE and Radio Waves.  In the enterprise WLAN market, we primarily compete with Huawei, Aerohive Networks, Aruba Networks (HPE), Ruckus Wireless (Arris), Cisco Meraki and Cisco. In the video surveillance market, we primarily compete with Axis Communications, HIKVISION, Mobotix and Vivotek. We expect increased competition from other established and emerging companies if our market continues to develop and expand. As we enter new markets, we expect to face competition from incumbent and new market participants.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not 
9

be available in every country in which our services and products are available. We seek patent protection for certain of our key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions.
We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also filed, and will continue to file, patent applications and trademark applications in the United States and other countries where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any patents or trademarks issued to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. There can be no assurance that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our intellectual property rights will give us competitive advantage.
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against infringers and counterfeiters, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. For further discussion of the risks associated with intellectual property, see “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property".
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we employed and or contracted with 843 full time equivalent employees, which included 509 in research and development, 121 in sales, general and administrative and 213 in operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
