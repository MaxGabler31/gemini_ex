Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing transformative medicines for the treatment of ocular diseases. Our novel proprietary technologies are designed to release drugs in ocular tissue at a controlled rate for up to 12 months in order to improve patient compliance, reduce healthcare burdens and, ultimately, deliver better clinical outcomes. Our lead product candidate, GB-102, is an intravitreal injection of a microparticle depot formulation of sunitinib, a potent inhibitor of neovascular growth and permeability, which are leading causes of retinal disease. We are developing GB-102 as a once-every-six month intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. In our Phase 1/2a clinical trial, GB-102 administered as a single 1 mg dose was well-tolerated in wet AMD patients and demonstrated durable clinical evidence of disease control of at least six months in approximately 88% of patients in this cohort. Subsequently, GB-102 completed a dose-ranging, standard-of-care controlled and masked safety and efficacy Phase 2b clinical trial in previously-treated patients with wet AMD (the ALTISSIMO trial). Of the 56 patients enrolled in our Phase 2b clinical trial, 50 patients completed the 12-month treatment phase (the Core Study), while the remaining six withdrew for reasons unrelated to their treatment. We reported topline data from the Phase 2b clinical trial in March 2021. Following the 12-month Core Study, 28 of the 50 patients who completed their Month 12 visit and met the eligibility criteria agreed to continue clinical monitoring in a six-month monitoring extension of the trial (the Extension Study). The goal of the Extension Study was to observe further durability of GB-102 in wet AMD patients. We reported topline data from the Extension Study in September 2021.  Based on the durability observed in the ALTISSIMO trial, we are evaluating the possibility of also developing GB-102 for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, or DR. Furthermore, we are using our proprietary technologies to develop GB-401, an intravitreally injected implant formulation of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent prodrug with a target dosing regimen of once every six months or longer for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma, or POAG. We believe that our product candidates could significantly improve clinical outcomes versus the respective standards of care for several ocular diseases.
 Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a chronic, progressive disease, a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly and estimated to affect approximately 15 million people in North America. The disease prevalence is approximately 85 to 90% nonexudative, or dry, AMD and 10 to 15% wet AMD. The therapeutic market for wet AMD in 2020 was estimated to be $9.0 billion worldwide and has historically grown by approximately 8% as a consequence of an aging population and the lack of preventative measures.
 There is no cure for wet AMD. To maintain vision, patients must receive frequent intravitreal injections, up to 12 times per year, with short-acting anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, agents. Although the use of anti-VEGF treatments has revolutionized visual outcomes for patients, the need for frequent injection visits combined with the increasing prevalence of this disease puts an enormous pressure on healthcare systems and represents a severe burden for patients, caregivers and physicians. These dynamics often lead to a reduced frequency of treatment and result in suboptimal visual outcomes in real-world practice.
 Damage to the retina as a result of DR includes a number of vision-threatening complications and has been an important cause of acquired vision loss in the young and middle-aged adult population. It is estimated that the number of patients with DR will increase globally to over 190 million by 2030. One-third of DR patients over 40 years of age in the United States are at risk of developing vision-threatening complications. Multiple clinical trials have shown that anti-VEGFs are also beneficial for the treatment of patients with DR without diabetic macular edema (DME); however, the need for frequent injections and follow-up for this often-asymptomatic population leads to inadequate compliance and suboptimal clinical benefit.
 GB-102, our lead product candidate, is designed to provide pan-VEGF inhibition for six months or longer while minimizing fluctuations in retinal thickness in between treatments, which is emerging as predictive of visual outcomes. We believe durable and sustained drug delivery with dosing every six months or longer offered by GB-102 could provide improved visual outcomes for patients with wet AMD, better patient quality-of-life and reduced disease-monitoring requirements.
 In the ALTISSIMO trial, disease control was achieved in 48% of patients for 6 months following a single intravitreal injection, and for 12 months in 55% of the patients who agreed to enter the 6-month Extension Study. This potentially longer duration of clinical benefit and consequently less frequent need for intravitreal injections may be more conducive to maintaining a typically asymptomatic patient with DR on an effective anti-VEGF therapy regimen. If approved for DR, GB-102 could provide a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with DR who are currently managed either by observation alone, pan-retinal laser photocoagulation or, in rare instances, with short-acting anti-VEGF injections.
 Our second product candidate, GB-401, is an intravitreally administered, proprietary implant formulation containing a prodrug of a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor designed to provide a controlled release of the active drug to maintain reduced intraocular pressure, or IOP, for six months or longer after a single injection, thus addressing the patient compliance problem and improving outcomes.

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the optic nerve that leads to visual impairment. It is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss that is projected to affect approximately 76 million people worldwide in 2020, including approximately 2.7 million people in the United States. The most common type of glaucoma is POAG, which is characterized by an increase in IOP because fluid, which is continuously generated by cells inside the front of the eye, cannot drain properly. The global POAG therapeutics market is estimated to reach approximately $3.8 billion in 2026, of which the United States represents approximately $2.9 billion.
 The most common treatment options for glaucoma are topical eye drops, which must be administered daily, or invasive medical procedures. Topical eye drops can lower IOP and have been shown to both delay and prevent the progressive degeneration associated with POAG. However, these medications must be administered up to four times per day, and approximately 30% of patients often require more than one class of drug to control IOP. It is estimated that approximately 50% of patients stop using their glaucoma medications in the first six months post-diagnosis due to various reasons, including forgetfulness, lack of disease awareness and/or cost, thus leading to uncontrolled IOP and progressive loss of peripheral vision. A sustained-release implant containing the IOP-lowering medicine bimatoprost was recently approved by the US Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, for only one injection in the front of the eye, limiting its potential use for this chronic disease. Laser-based or surgical treatments to permanently reduce IOP are invasive and achievement of IOP targets may require multiple surgeries. If approved, GB-401 could represent a significant paradigm shift in the way physicians treat POAG.
 We have acquired intellectual property that will enable us to expand our pipeline into additional disease areas, including geographic atrophy as well as inherited retinal and corneal diseases. 
 Our pipeline
 The following chart summarizes the status and development plan for the disclosed product candidates in our pipeline. We own worldwide rights to each of our programs.
 

Our proprietary technologies
 Our proprietary technologies are designed to allow sustained delivery of pharmacologic agents to the eye in a well-tolerated and controlled manner to achieve extended duration of effectiveness. Our proprietary technologies utilize microparticle depot and implant formulations each containing biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA. 
 The microparticles are engineered to carry a hydrophilic coating such as polyethylene glycol, or PEG, that helps eliminate or minimize inflammation typically associated with intraocular administration of conventional PLGA microparticles. Our preclinical studies and Phase 1, 2a, and 2b clinical trials provided preliminary evidence that our microparticles are well-tolerated in the eye.
 Furthermore, our microparticles are designed to aggregate after intravitreal injection upon exposure to the vitreous fluid at body temperature to form a depot near the bottom of the eye, outside of the visual axis. Our biodegradable microparticles then gradually release the active ingredient at a rate dependent on the composition of the polymers and biodegrade into lactic acid, glycolic acid and 
 5

PEG that are naturally cleared from the body.  Our implants are designed to be injected near the bottom of the eye and are expected to remain in place due to their geometry and the structure of the vitreous humor.
 

Some molecules, due to their physicochemical properties, are difficult to integrate into polymer formulations and deliver in a controlled manner. For that purpose, we have developed a proprietary prodrug technology to enable sustained delivery of these therapeutics. Our research and development team has developed our product candidates with different pharmacologic agents using these prodrug technologies. For example, GB-401 has been developed using this approach.
 We have also developed intravitreally-injected implant formulations containing biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, in the form of a rod, that we intend to use in our upcoming Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our GB-401 program.  
 Our lead program GB-102
 We are developing our lead product candidate, GB-102, as a once-every-six months intravitreally delivered microparticle depot formulation of sunitinib for the treatment of wet AMD. Sunitinib is a pan-VEGF inhibitor that targets several neovascular pathways (VEGF-A, B, C and D). We believe that GB-102 is differentiated from the current standard of care, which requires more frequent dosing, up to 12 times per year, and primarily targets one neovascular pathway (VEGF-A).
 In January 2019, we completed a Phase 1/2a trial in 32 patients with wet AMD (the ADAGIO trial). This trial met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. No ocular serious adverse event, or SAE, or dose-limiting toxicity was reported, and the majority of patients had no drug-related adverse events, or AEs. The most common AE was the presence of medication in the anterior chamber. These AEs were reversible and with no long-term sequelae. In this trial, 88% of patients who were previously treated with an average of eight injections annually were able to maintain stable central retinal thickness and visual acuity for six months or more with a single injection of 1 mg of GB-102. 
 Based on the data from the ADAGIO trial, we initiated the Phase 2b ALTISSIMO trial in September 2019 to evaluate an improved product formulation that would minimize the presence of medication within the anterior chamber. This trial was designed to compare two doses of GB-102 (1 or 2 mg) administered every six months to aflibercept administered every two months in up to 56 patients with anti-VEGF-responsive wet AMD. On the basis of a safety analysis of the Phase 2a clinical trial of GB-102 in macular edema (ME), described below, and the interim safety data in the ALTISSIMO trial, we terminated the development of the GB-102 2 mg dose in all of our clinical trial programs. The primary endpoint of the ALTISSIMO trial was to determine time-to-additional anti-VEGF supportive therapy. Of the 56 patients originally enrolled in the study, 50 completed the 12-month Core Study and six withdrew for reasons unrelated to their treatment. Furthermore, 28 of the 50 patients who completed their Month 12 ALTISSIMO visit were eligible and agreed to continue masked clinical monitoring until the point at which they required additional supportive therapy, up to a maximum of six months. ALTISSIMO topline results were released in March 2021, and the topline results of the 6-month Extension Study were released in September 2021. 
 In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of GB-102 in 21 patients with ME secondary to DME and branch or central retinal vein occlusion (RVO). This trial was designed to be a six-month, single injection, multicenter, open-label, parallel arm trial with a primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of two dose levels of GB-102 (1 and 2 mg) in patients with ME secondary to DME or RVO who had been previously treated with anti-VEGFs. All patients have completed the study and the final safety analysis has been performed. An interim data analysis from the ALTISSIMO and ME trials identified 1 mg of GB-102 as the optimal dose for future clinical trials. In 2021, we decided to prioritize development of GB-102 in wet AMD.

Additional pipeline programs
 We are also applying our proprietary technologies to develop GB-401, a proprietary implant formulation containing a prodrug of a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, designed to be injected once every six months or longer to reduce IOP in POAG patients. We expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for GB-401 and initiate a dose-escalating Phase 1/2a clinical trial of GB-401 in patients with POAG in the first half of 2023.
 We believe our proprietary technologies and our acquired intellectual property will allow us to develop other novel therapeutics, either alone or in combination, that can treat additional diseases, achieve extended durations of effectiveness, and improve the care and quality of life for patients with chronic diseases and disorders of the eye.

 Wet AMD
 Wet AMD is a common ocular disease caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the central portion of the retina, or macula. This growth is triggered by VEGF, a protein produced by cells that stimulates the formation of new abnormal blood vessels, a process called neovascularization, and induces vascular permeability, leading to leakage and swelling of the retina. Anti-VEGF treatment has been shown to improve vision in patients with wet AMD when compared to either no treatment or laser alone.
 According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, it is estimated that 15 million people in North America have AMD. The prevalence of the disease is approximately 85 to 90% nonexudative, or dry, AMD and 10 to 15% wet AMD. As a greater percentage of Americans are living well beyond 60 years of age, more patients will become visually impaired from AMD than from glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy combined. Early intervention is essential to treat wet AMD; without treatment, vision rapidly declines. The figure below illustrates the primary effects of wet AMD.

Our market opportunity in wet AMD
 In 2020, annual anti-VEGF sales reported for the treatment of retinal diseases exceeded $15 billion in 2020 globally. We believe a substantial majority of these sales were in connection with the treatment of wet AMD and DME. Avastin is also used off-label in over 50% of the wet AMD patients in the United States, therefore the potential therapeutic market is greater than reported. The wet AMD market has historically grown by approximately 8% because of an aging population and lack of preventative procedures.
 Despite the significant benefits of existing therapeutic options, the need for frequent intravitreal injections is burdensome for both patients and retinal specialists. Retinal practitioners surveyed by the American Society of Retinal Specialists responded that their three greatest unmet needs are availability of long-acting sustained drug delivery, therapies that reduce treatment burden and new treatment mechanisms of action. According to a 2019 study of patient interviews in the United States, France and Australia, the factors affecting adherence from the patient perspective included the psychological burden of repeated intravitreal injections, the time burden of both treatment and monitoring visits for both patients and caregivers, which could take up to 12 hours per visit including travel time.
 In clinical trials, intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF drugs resulted in significant gains in visual acuity for patients with retinal diseases. However, in settings outside of clinical trials, patients often receive less frequent injections than in clinical trial settings. Long-term observational studies in the United States, Europe and Japan have demonstrated that many patients with wet AMD lose visual acuity due to the challenges associated with receiving anti-VEGF injections at an optimal frequency.
 The diagram below shows the declining visual acuity, or VA, results over four years after the first anti-VEGF injection in patients with wet AMD in the United States.
 

Most recently, it was shown that fluctuations between injections in retinal thickness in eyes receiving treatment for wet AMD is adversely associated with visual outcomes.
 Diabetic retinopathy 
 
Diabetic retinopathy, or DR, is the leading cause of acquired vision loss in the young and middle-aged adult population. Of an estimated 463 million people with diabetes mellitus, or DM, worldwide, approximately one-third have signs of DR and of these, a further one-third  experience vision-threatening DR. Mild, or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is the first stage of diabetic retinopathy which is often asymptomatic but shows blocked or abnormal blood vessels, such as microaneurysms.  Without good control of diabetes, patients can develop diabetic macular edema, or DME, and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). DME affects central vision and can lead to a decline in vision ranging from slight visual blurring to blindness, substantially affecting independence and quality of life. If left untreated, DME is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with DR. The abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) in PDR can lead to reduction of vision and, if left untreated, eventually to retinal detachment and blindness.

The figure below illustrates the primary effects of diabetic retinopathy with diabetic macular edema compared to a healthy eye.
 


Our market opportunity in DR 
 Approximately 30 million people in the United States have diabetes, 10 million of whom suffer from DR, including 1.5 million with DME. DME is the second largest market for anti-VEGF therapies, accounting for approximately $3.8 billion of sales worldwide and approximately $1.1 billion in the United States in 2020. It is estimated that there are three times as many DR patients as there are DME patients, which illustrates the commercial attractiveness of the DR indication for which short-acting anti-VEGFs have been recently approved. Multiple trials have shown that anti-VEGFs are also beneficial for the treatment of DR without DME; however, the need for frequent injections and follow-up in this often asymptomatic population leads to inadequate compliance and subsequent vision loss.
 Our product candidates
 GB-102
 GB-102 is a potent small molecule multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib malate, or sunitinib, formulated in our proprietary microparticles and designed to be administered intravitreally once every six months. Prior to administration, GB-102 is suspended in a buffered diluent and injected intravitreally in a manner similar to the standard in clinical practice with anti-VEGFs. After injection, sunitinib is gradually released from the microparticle formulation into the vitreous chamber and is designed to sustain therapeutic drug levels in the ocular tissues for up to six months. Sunitinib also has a high binding affinity to the natural melanin pigment granules in the retina that allows the retinal pigmented epithelium, or RPE, to serve as a potential secondary drug reservoir and extend duration of action.
 Sunitinib is an orally administered treatment for advanced renal, gastric and pancreatic malignancies that was originally approved in 2006. Oral sunitinib has demonstrated efficacy in murine laser choroidal neovascularization, or CNV, models and in wet AMD patients for the treatment of their cancers. However, because of a boxed warning related to hepatotoxicity for cancer indications, oral sunitinib has not been used for retinal indications. There are no reported cases of retinal toxicities in patients receiving continuous oral sunitinib for up to six years for the management of primary malignancies. In our preclinical and clinical studies, we have demonstrated that there are no detectable levels of sunitinib in the plasma after intravitreal injections of GB-102. Sunitinib’s mechanism of action is the inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, specifically of VEGF receptors 1, 2 and 3, blocking all VEGF signals, including VEGF-A, -B, -C and -D and placental growth factor, or PlGF, which are ligands implicated in pathologic neovascularization in patients with wet AMD. Moreover, sunitinib is a DLK-inhibitor, which may result in a neuroprotective effect.

Our clinical trials
 Phase 1/2a trial of GB-102 in patients with wet AMD
 In January 2019, we completed our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of GB-102 in patients with wet AMD, or our ADAGIO trial. This trial enrolled patients with wet AMD diagnosed less than 18 months prior to enrollment who had received at least three prior injections of any anti-VEGF treatment and demonstrated a response to anti-VEGF treatment, defined as physician-reported improvement in vision or reduction in macular thickness. Eligible patients received a single injection of GB-102 and were followed for eight months. Monthly assessments included adverse events, best-corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, protocol letter score, central sub-field thickness, or CST, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy and plasma blood samples to detect systemic levels of sunitinib. Patients were eligible for supportive anti-VEGF treatment if any of the following criteria were met: ≥ 10 letter loss in BCVA (ETDRS) with new or increasing intra- or sub-retinal fluid judged to be the cause in the reduction in BCVA; an increase of ≥ 75 µm in CST from baseline; new onset vitreous hemorrhage. 
  
In the ADAGIO trial, GB-102 met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability with no ocular SAEs or dose limiting toxicities. Our data demonstrated that for patients who required an average of eight injections per year to control their disease, a single injection of GB-102 at various doses was able to maintain their central retinal thickness and visual acuity for six months or more, while significantly reducing the frequency of injection. The overall best performing dose was the 1 mg, which controlled the disease in seven out of eight patients for six months, and in four out of eight patients beyond eight months.
 Since the most commonly reported ocular AE was presence of medication in the anterior chamber, we optimized the manufacturing process for GB-102 to enhance the binding affinity of the microparticles’ surface, thus improving their ability to aggregate post injection. This optimized version of the microparticles was used for the Phase 2a Macular Edema and Phase 2b ALTISSIMO trials.
 Phase 2 clinical trials
 Phase 2a trial of GB-102 in ME secondary to DME or RVO. In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of GB-102 in 21 patients with ME secondary to DME and RVO. This trial was designed to be a six-month, single injection, multicenter, open-label, parallel arm trial with a primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of two dose levels of GB-102 (1 and 2 mg).
 Six centers in the United States enrolled 21 patients (n=10 DME; n=5 BRVO; n=6 CRVO) who had received at least three prior injections of anti-VEGF and shown at least some response within the last 24 months. In addition to the primary safety and tolerability endpoints noted above, secondary endpoints of the ME study were pharmacodynamics measures including mean change from baseline in BCVA (ETDRS), mean change from baseline in CST (SD-OCT), and time to rescue treatment. As the focus of the ME trial was safety, disease control was not a requirement at enrollment, and patient eligibility was not verified by independent third parties. On average, at enrollment, patients required eight injections per year to control their disease. Eligible patients received GB-102 (1 or 2 mg) at day 1 and were followed monthly.
 There were no drug related non-ocular AEs in the trial. The 1 mg dose met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability with seven out of ten patients demonstrating no adverse events. One patient had only vitreous floaters and one patient had vitreous floaters, medication present in the vitreous, and reduction in vision. The other AEs occurred in a single patient with medication present in the anterior chamber. The 2 mg dose was associated with medication present in the anterior chamber of five out of 11 patients. The majority of AEs occurred in these patients. Two SAEs were reported in a single patient (severe vision loss due to presence of medication in the anterior chamber and corneal edema as a result of wash-out of the anterior chamber). On the basis of an interim analysis performed at month 3 in the ME trial, it was determined that the 1 mg dose was well-tolerated. We believe that the number of microparticles injected 
 10

in the 2 mg dose (approximately 2 million) were too many to allow adequate aggregation. The graphic below, photographed using wide field color fundus photography, represents an example of progression of the GB-102 1 mg depot throughout the six-month observation period.
 

The table below summarizes the drug-related adverse events reported in the ME trial.
 
These results provided additional support for terminating further development of GB-102 2 mg dose.
 11

Phase 2b trial
We initiated the Phase 2b clinical trial of GB-102 in patients with wet AMD (ALTISSIMO trial) in September 2019 and reported topline data from the 12-month treatment phase in March 2021 (the Core Study). ALTISSIMO was a 12-month, multicenter, prospective, double-masked, randomized (3:3:2), 3-parallel arm trial comparing two doses of GB-102 (1 and 2 mg) administered every six months to aflibercept administered every two months in patients with anti-VEGF-responsive wet AMD. GB-102 subjects were injected on the first day of the study (D1, or Baseline) and at their six-month visit (M6, or Month 6) and were followed for a total of 12 months.  Eligible subjects were offered monthly monitoring visits for an additional six months during the Extension Study. The results of the Extension Study were communicated in September 2021.
 Similar to the population in the ADAGIO trial, key eligibility criteria included patients with wet AMD diagnosed less than 18 months prior to enrollment, who had received at least three prior injections of any anti-VEGF and demonstrated response to anti-VEGF treatment, defined as physician-reported reduction in macular thickness. In addition, those patients received an anti-VEGF injection within 21 days of screening. Eligible patients received either GB-102 (1 or 2 mg) or aflibercept at day one and were followed monthly for 12 consecutive months during the Core Study. Monthly assessments included adverse events, BCVA, CST, complete ophthalmic examination, wide-field fundus photography and plasma blood samples to detect systemic levels of sunitinib.
 
Patients were eligible for additional anti-VEGF supportive therapy (aflibercept) if they met the following prespecified criteria:
 
 
• | Decrease in BCVA (any of the following criteria):
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | ≥ 5 ETDRS letter decrease compared with the average of last 2 visit BCVA ETDRS letter scores, and/or,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ≥ 10 ETDRS letter decrease compared with best on-study BCVA ETDRS letter score.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase in CST (any of the following criteria):
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ≥ 75 µm compared with the average of the last 2 visit CST measurements (µm), and/or,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ≥ 100 µm compared with the lowest on-study CST measurement (µm).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 We initially designed the ALTISSIMO trial to enroll 160 patients and initiated the trial in September 2019. In December 2019, we voluntarily paused enrollment as a precautionary measure following the report of a single patient experiencing SAEs with the 2 mg dose in the Phase 2a trial of GB-102 in ME patients, as noted in the table above. Interim safety analyses of the macular edema trial demonstrated that five out of 11 patients in the 2 mg dose had medication in the anterior chamber as compared to one patient in the 1 mg dose. We then performed an ad-hoc interim safety analysis of ALTISSIMO in February 2020. In order to preserve data integrity, trial personnel including investigators, patients, study technicians and reading center remained masked at all times. No drug related SAEs were reported in ALTISSIMO. Presence of medication in the anterior chamber was reported in four patients in the GB-102 2 mg dose group and one patient in the 1 mg dose group.
 Based on the number of patients in the 2 mg dose group who had medication in the anterior chamber in our ME and the ALTISSIMO trials, we decided to terminate the development of the GB-102 2 mg dose in all of our clinical trial programs. In addition, we capped enrollment in the ALTISSIMO trial at 56 patients as we had sufficient patients to explore repeat dosing with the GB-102 1 mg dose. We amended the protocol of the ALTISSIMO trial to ensure the GB-102 1 mg dose was used for re-dosing of all patients on GB-102 at month six, regardless of their original dose assignment. Finally, following discussions with the FDA, we shifted the primary endpoint—median time to first additional anti-VEGF supportive therapy—from month 10 to month 12. On the basis of a safety analysis of the ME trial and interim safety data in the ALTISSIMO trial, we terminated the development of the GB-102 2 mg dose in all of our clinical trial programs and amended the protocol of the ALTISSIMO trial, so that patients who had received a first dose of GB-102 2mg would be re-dosed with GB-102 1mg at their M6 visit.

The revised ALTISSIMO trial design is provided in the figure below:
 

A total of 56 patients were randomized with 21 patients receiving GB-102 1 mg/1 mg (Group 1), 22 patients receiving GB-102 2 mg/1 mg (Group 2), and 13 patients receiving aflibercept bimonthly as per label (Group 3).  D1, or Day 1, indicates the first visit for each patient at which the patient was dosed with the drug for the study arm to which they were randomized; a safety monitoring visit occurred approximately two weeks (D14) following each patient’s first injection, after which all study visits were monthly (M1, M2 and so on). 
 In December 2020, a total of 50 out of the 56 patients that enrolled (89.3%) completed the study through M12, and 6 patients (10.7%) discontinued prematurely due to reasons unrelated to the study medication. 28 patients continued into the Extension Study (11 patients in Group 1; 11 patients in Group 2 and 6 patients in Group 3).
 The main safety endpoint was the occurrence of ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs. A higher proportion of patients in the GB-102 groups reported drug-related AEs in the study eye compared to patients in the aflibercept group. In the GB-102 groups, the majority of drug-related AEs in the study eye were mild or moderate in severity. AEs in the study eye that were considered by investigators to be related to study drug were reported in 17 patients (77.3%) in Group 2, 9 patients (42.9%) in Group 1 and no patients in Group 3. 
 The majority of patients in Group 1 (those receiving GB-102 1mg/1mg, the intended dose for future clinical trials) had no drug related AEs. Out of the 9 patients with drug-related AEs, four patients had vitreous floaters which were transient in nature, mostly noted after the first dose and were only associated with blurring of vision in one patient. Two patients had the majority of the AEs, both related to dispersion of particles and concurrent inflammation. 
 The amount of time between treatment and the need for subsequent treatment is known as duration.  Of the 21 patients in Group 1, 48% (10 patients) achieved duration of 6 months or more and experienced an average 58% reduction in the annualized frequency of injections required to manage their disease, as compared to their treatments prior to entering the trial. Of the Group 1 patients who enrolled in the Extension Study, 55% of those patients (6 of 11) did not receive rescue treatment until Month 18 representing an average 73% reduction in the annualized frequency of injections required to manage their disease, as compared to their treatments prior to entering the trial. 
 CST was controlled by both GB-102 (1 mg/1 mg) and GB-102 (2 mg/1 mg) within about 50 μm of aflibercept. The mean BCVA trended lower as compared to aflibercept in both GB-102 groups. The decrease in BCVA was mainly driven by 4 subjects in Group 1. These subjects had a combination of high anti-VEGF need prior to enrollment, particle dispersion during the study, or AEs unrelated to the drug. It is likely that patients who require frequent high dose anti-VEGF injections to control their disease  are not the best candidates to receive extended-release formulations such as GB-102 1mg.  
 We believe that reduction in particle dispersion will likely lead to a better safety and efficacy profile in a future clinical trial.  We have developed a reformulation of the diluent used in GB-102 1 mg to increase the speed at which the microparticles aggregate immediately following their injection into the eye.  We have conducted preclinical studies of this reformulated diluent in anticipation of submitting an IND amendment in the second half of 2022.  We have not modified the composition or manufacturing methods of the microparticles from those used in ALTISSIMO.
 Our future development plans
 Pending positive feedback from the FDA on our amended IND application, we expect that an additional Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and durability of GB-102 1mg, with the reformulated diluent, in non-naïve wet AMD patients could substantially mitigate the risk of proceeding to Phase 3 studies. We believe that the optimal design of this Phase 2 trial requires it to be open label 
 13

with only one study arm, and the visual acuity evaluator must be masked.   Eligibility criteria will benefit from the lessons learned in ALTISSIMO, and will, among other things, require that patients participating in the study to have been diagnosed with wet AMD within 12 months of screening, treated at least three times with an anti-VEGF within six months of screening, and must have demonstrated good response to such treatments. 
 The design of the Phase 2 trial is provided in the figure below (numbers in blue indicate weeks from first injection with GB-102):

We expect that this study design will be sufficient to determine whether particle dispersion, which appeared to be most prevalent within three months following each injection of GB-102 1mg in ALTISSIMO, has been satisfactorily resolved by the new formulation.
 GB-102: Potential for 6-month or longer duration in DR
 Based on the results of the ALTISSIMO trial, GB-102 has demonstrated the potential to maintain therapeutic drug levels in the retinal tissue for up to 12 months from a single intravitreal injection. We believe that GB-102’s potential for at least 6-month durability and reduction in frequency of injections could significantly improve the standard of care for DR patients.
 The results of an additional Phase 2 study of GB-102 with the reformulated diluent in wet AMD will inform the timing and design of the clinical development program to explore the future development of GB-102 for DR. 
 GB-401
 Disease overview
 Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the optic nerve, leading to visual impairment, and is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. POAG is the most common type of glaucoma.
 Though the specific mechanism of neuronal damage in POAG has not been fully identified, progressive visual field loss is associated with increased IOP. Chronically elevated IOP can lead to neuronal degeneration and retinal ganglion cell death with resulting disruption of the visual pathway. Increased IOP is caused by the over-production of the clear fluid in the eye behind the cornea, or aqueous humor, and/or decreased drainage of the aqueous humor from the eye. Currently approved topical eye drops can lower IOP by either decreasing aqueous humor production and/or enhancing aqueous humor drainage when used as directed by a physician. These medications must be administered up to four times per day, and it is estimated that approximately 30% of patients often require more than one medication.
  In the healthy eye, the ciliary body produces fluid that circulates through the pupil and drains in the corner, or the angle, of the eye where the cornea and iris meet. In POAG, pressure in the eye can increase if there is increased fluid production and/or decreased drainage in the angle leading to elevated IOP. Chronically elevated IOP can lead to neuronal degeneration and retinal ganglion cell death with resulting disruption of the visual pathway.
 Market overview
 Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss affecting approximately 76 million people worldwide in 2020, including approximately 2.7 million people in the United States. The global POAG therapeutics market is estimated to reach approximately $3.8 billion in 2026, of which the United States represents approximately $2.9 billion.
 Various drug classes for glaucoma therapy include prostaglandin analogs, or PGAs, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, rho-kinase inhibitors, combination drugs and others. PGAs are preferred as first-line therapy for glaucoma due to their effectiveness in reducing IOP, once-daily dosing and reduced side effects as compared to other therapies. The PGA segment accounted for a market share of approximately 40% in the United States in 2019 and is expected to remain dominant until meaningfully 
 14

superior agents are developed and approved. The second most prescribed class of eye drops is beta-blockers, however, these have a less favorable systemic side effect profile, including decreased heart rate, slowed breathing rate and decreased blood pressure.
 
A number of procedures have been developed to treat patients whose disease has significantly progressed. These include laser or surgical treatments reserved for patients for whom other measures have failed.
 Unmet need
 Importance of greater compliance in glaucoma is considered a large unmet need. It is estimated that approximately 50% of patients stop taking their glaucoma medications within the first six months of treatment initiation due to various reasons, including forgetfulness, lack of disease awareness and/or cost. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication regimens has been documented in numerous independent studies, particularly in patients on two or more prescription eye drops. Additionally, studies show that more than 30% of patients often require more than one medication.
 Furthermore, because glaucoma progresses slowly and causes few symptoms, patients often do not adhere to their medication regimens as prescribed until the disease has progressed to the point of significant vision loss. As a result, despite the availability of medication to treat glaucoma, progressive visual loss and blindness still often occur. According to a 2015 analysis published in the Translational Vision Science & Technology Journal, 15% to 20% of glaucoma patients progress to blindness within 15 to 20 years of diagnosis.
 Our goal is to provide sustained reduction of elevated IOP associated with POAG to increase compliance for patients and improve the medical management of glaucoma. For patients, our goal is to eliminate the need for daily eye drops required to manage elevated IOP. For physicians, our goal is to design a long-acting IOP-lowering treatment that can be administered in the office through intravitreal injections, ensuring patient compliance for up to six months.
 Our solution
 GB-401 has the potential to reduce elevated IOP for up to six months. GB-401 contains a proprietary new chemical entity, or NCE, prodrug of a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, or beta-blocker, formulated with our biodegradable polymer implant technology for controlled release and is designed to be administered intravitreally once every six months. Upon exposure to water under physiological conditions, the prodrug is released from the implant and is converted into the active beta-blocker by hydrolysis. The polymer biodegrades into normal metabolic by-products of lactic and glycolic acid and is naturally cleared from the eye.
 


Our proprietary implant formulation of GB-401 is designed to provide controlled drug release within the eye that minimizes the risk for systemic exposure of the beta-blocker, a class of drugs known to have significant risks of cardiac side effects when administered topically, such as with eye drops. The figure below illustrates sustained in vitro drug release from the GB-401 implant for approximately 120 days at 37° C.  We have successfully completed preclinical studies to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetics of GB-401.  There is, 
 15

however, a lack of validated animal models for reliably predicting long-term pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans in the treatment of glaucoma using beta-blockers, so preclinical results may not be predictive of human clinical results.
 
In a preclinical study in rabbits, the biodegradability of GB-401 implant was visually assessed over a period 24 weeks, or 168 days.  Similar to prior experiences with GB-102 microparticles, which demonstrated a durability of six months for approximately half of the patients studied in clinical trials while appearing to be nearly biodegraded within approximately four months in rabbits, the GB-401 implants also appeared to be substantially biodegraded in rabbit eyes within four months post injection.  The images below are representative color fundus photographs from different animals at different timepoints. 

 Beta-blockers have been used as the comparative control for the approval of topical agents for IOP reduction, including PGAs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, rho-kinase inhibitors and alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists. Beta-blocker eye drops must be administered once or twice daily and often produce systemic exposure which can lead to decreases in heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory function. Though prostaglandins are the leading class of agents used to reduce IOP, evidence suggests that continuous exposure may lead to loss of IOP reduction effects that may be due to receptor fatigue from continuous stimulation, as well as poor compliance due to topical side effects.
 We believe that GB-401 has the potential to provide sustained reduction in IOP for up to six months, thus eliminating the need for frequent patient-instilled eye drops and potentially improving patient compliance in this vision-threatening disease. GB-401 could also improve tolerability by reducing ocular hyperemia (red eyes due to irritation) and sunken eye (reduction in peri-orbital fat), which are common side effects for PGAs and rho-kinase inhibitors, while eliminating systemic drug exposure. Therefore, we believe our proprietary beta-blocker technology represents a validated but differentiated pharmacological approach.
 16

We have also developed a proprietary custom applicator that is designed to enable convenient and safe injection of the GB-401 implant in the vitreous.
 Our future development plans
 We may pursue clinical development for GB-401 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which would obviate the need to conduct certain preclinical toxicology and safety studies. If we decide to use the 505(b)(2) pathway, we would rely in part on the FDA’s prior findings for the previously approved active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, as well as relevant publications, and to complete a repeat-dose GLP toxicology study with GB-401, to support the filing of an IND for GB-401 and any future 505(b)(2) new drug application, or NDA. At the time of NDA submission, we expect to provide the FDA with all required nonclinical elements in the NDA either directly through original studies, published literature, and the FDA’s prior findings as reflected in the approved labeling for the previously approved API which contains the same API as GB-401. We plan to initiate a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, sequential escalating dose-cohorts Phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic effects of a single intravitreal injection of GB-401 in patients with POAG in the first half of 2023. The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of ocular and non-ocular adverse events. Secondary endpoints will include pharmacodynamic evaluation of IOP. If we pursue the 505(b)(2) pathway, we would expect to rely upon this Phase 1/2a clinical trial, as well as two Phase 3 trials, which we currently envision as multi-center, randomized, double-blind trials with dosing once every 6 months in patients with POAG or ocular hypertension, with approximately 350 to 600 participants per trial. The final Phase 3 trial designs and sample sizes will be determined based upon our ongoing discussions with the FDA and the results of the Phase 1/2a trial.
 Commercialization
 We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We intend to secure a partner to fund and complete Phase 3 development of GB-102 and, if approved, commercialize it in the territories in which GB-102 would be licensed out.
 If GB-401 receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States with our own specialty sales force, which we would expect to range from 50 to 125 sales representatives. We will also explore a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties in markets outside the United States.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These organizations compete with us for recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies complementary to our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of GB-102, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method and frequency of administration, on-mechanism durability of therapeutic effect, convenience, price, level of generic competition and availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. The method of administration of GB-102, intravitreal injection, is commonly used to administer ophthalmic drugs for the treatment of severe disease and is generally accepted by patients facing the prospect of severe visual loss or blindness. However, a therapy that offers a less invasive method of administration might have a competitive advantage over one administered by intravitreal injection, depending on the relative efficacy, safety and durability of the other method of administration.
 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people who are 50 years of age or older in the industrialized world. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments have proven to be safe and effective in restoring vision, but they require frequent injections to maintain the visual acuity gain (every 4 weeks with ranibizumab, every 4 to 8 weeks with aflibercept, and every 8 to 12 weeks with brolucizumab). This frequency of injection puts an enormous burden on the patients, their caregivers, physicians, and the healthcare system overall. As a result, many patients do not receive frequent injections, which leads to suboptimal visual acuity. An annual survey conducted for retinal specialists worldwide by the American Society of 
 17

Retinal Specialists (ASRS) reported that in wet AMD therapeutics, the greatest unmet needs is for “long-lasting therapies”, further reinforcing the need for durable intervention.
 The current standard of care for wet AMD is monotherapy administration of anti-VEGF drugs, principally Avastin (bevacizumab), Lucentis (ranibizumab), and Eylea (aflibercept), which are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Beovu was approved in 2019 and demonstrated superior durability to the current standard of care but, due to rare but blinding complication of vascular occlusion, is being used as the 2nd line therapy
 Recently, faricimab, a bispecific antibody against VEGF and Angiopoietin-2(Ang-2), was approved for the treatment of wet AMD and DME in the U.S. and is marketed under the trade name VABYSMO. Faricimab has the potential to prolong the existing treatment intervals with its demonstrated disease control of up to 16 weeks (VABYSMO Prescribing Information). The recent approval of the Port Delivery System (PDS) with ranibizumab, marketed under the trade name SUSVIMO, allows delivery of a steady dose of ranibizumab for 6 months or longer can further extend the injection intervals. In clinical trials of SUSVIMO, 98.4% of patients did not require supplemental intravitreal treatment for at least 24 weeks, however, SUSVIMO requires surgical intervention that may impose additional burden overall and is associated with AEs from the surgical procedure, including a boxed warning for endophthalmitis (SUSVIMO Prescribing Information 2021). Therefore, sustained, predictable disease control with infrequent injection remains an unmet need.
 Kodiak Sciences is also developing KSI-301 and is in the phase 2b/3 trials for treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO, but has recently announced that the first Phase 2b/3 trial of KSI-301 in wet AMD failed to meet its primary endpoint.  REGENEXBIO is also developing a suprachoroidal or subretinal gene therapy that delivers anti-VEGF and is currently in phase 3 treatments for wet AMD, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is currently in a phase 3 trial of a higher dose of aflibercept, the active ingredient in Eylea. Results from the Regeneron Pharmaceutical trials are expected in 2022. Physicians, patients, and third-party payors may not accept the addition of GB-102 to their current treatment regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including:
 
 
• | if they do not wish to incur the additional cost, if any, of GB-102;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if they perceive the addition of GB-102 to be of limited benefit to patients compared to existing treatment options;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if sufficient coverage and reimbursement are not available; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | if they do not perceive GB-102 to have a favorable risk-benefit profile.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are developing GB-102 as an alternative to existing anti-VEGF drugs, including Avastin, Lucentis, Eylea, Beovu, VABYSMO, and SUSVIMO. Accordingly, GB-102 would directly compete with these therapies. While we believe GB-102 will compete favorably with existing anti-VEGF drugs, future approved standalone or combination therapies for wet AMD and for DR with demonstrated improved efficacy over GB-102 or currently marketed therapies with a favorable safety profile and any of the following characteristics, might pose a significant competitive threat to us:
 
 
• | a mechanism of action that does not involve VEGF;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | a duration of action that obviates the need for twice-yearly intravitreal injection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a method of administration that effectively avoids intravitreal injection; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant cost savings or reimbursement advantages compared to GB-102 and other anti-VEGF therapies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. An anti-VEGF gene therapy product might substantially reduce the number and frequency of intravitreal injections when treating wet AMD and DR, making GB-102 unattractive to physicians and patients. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products.
 We expect that product candidates currently in clinical development, or that could enter clinical development in the near future, could represent competition, if approved. These product candidates may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. Because there are a variety of means to treat wet AMD and DR, our patents and other proprietary protections for GB-102 will not prevent development or commercialization of product candidates that are different from GB-102.
 Manufacturing
 18

We have neither large-scale manufacturing facilities nor personnel, other than personnel who manage our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, relationships. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, for the next few years, on third parties for the manufacture of certain components of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing and clinical testing.  We are establishing low-volume good manufacturing practice, or GMP, manufacturing capability to support our Ph 1/2a clinical trial of GB-401 and the next Phase 2 clinical trial of GB-102.  We have contracted with a single contract manufacturing and development organization to design, develop, and manufacture a proprietary applicator for our GB-401 implant.
 Our drug candidates include small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from base materials. We purchase our drug substances from reliable sources and we believe that our microparticle and implant manufacturing processes are amenable to scale-up. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. We anticipate that these arrangements will be sufficient for the manufacture of our product candidates until such time that we decide that we should establish our own large-scale manufacturing facility and it becomes operational.
 Until we believe it is prudent to establish our own large-scale manufacturing facility, we will continue to rely on CMOs for parts of the drug manufacturing process, such as filling and labelling of our products for commercial sale and the manufacture of implant applicators. While we believe that having control over the whole manufacturing process would allow us to reduce cycle times, increase the robustness and consistency of the process and reduce cost of goods for commercial production, we also believe that investing in a dedicated manufacturing facility at this time would not be an efficient use of our capital.
 Intellectual property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our therapeutic products for ocular diseases, which include our novel microparticle aggregation and implant technologies, to deliver known active agents such as sunitinib as well as our novel prodrugs such as the one in GB-401. We also seek to protect our proprietary methods of treatment using our delivery technologies for ocular disease, alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents. In addition, we seek protection on processes for the production of our aggregating microparticles and implants, and dosing regimens and formulations for the ocular administration of our products. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing, purchasing, or exclusively in-licensing U.S. and foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technologies, active pharmaceutical ingredients, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. In addition, we currently plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide a period of regulatory data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our drug products.
 
We are the sole owner of eleven patent families covering our products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and proprietary aggregating microparticle technology, which include composition of matter, methods of use and processes of manufacture, as described in more detail below. Our owned patent estate as of December 31, 2021, on a worldwide basis, includes over 60 granted or pending patent applications with nine granted U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. patent application, eleven pending U.S. non-provisional applications, one pending international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and more than 40 pending patent applications that have entered the national phase of prosecution in countries outside the United States.
 We have exclusively licensed five patent families from Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, described below, and have granted an exclusive sublicense to Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Kala, solely in the area of delivery through a mucosal barrier for the five families licensed from JHU only. Our patent estate exclusively licensed from JHU as of December 31, 2021, on a worldwide basis, includes 43 granted or pending patent applications with ten granted U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional applications and 30 pending or granted patents that have entered the national phase of prosecution in countries outside the United States. 
 We have acquired two patent families and licensed one patent family from a private company for the treatment of disorders of the ear and eye, including retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt’s Disease, and Leber’s congenital amaurosis. The two patent families that we acquired have also been licensed back to the private company for their use in non-overlapping therapeutic areas. As of December 31, 2021, this acquired patent estate includes two pending U.S. non-provisional applications and five pending patent applications that have entered the national phase of prosecution in countries outside the United States.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to adapt to competition or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. Our patent filing strategy generally includes seeking patent protection 
 19

in the United States, the European Union and China (which may include Macau and Hong Kong) and may in addition seek protection in countries where we believe such protection is likely to be useful, including one or more of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia and Taiwan.
 The exclusivity terms of our patents depend upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. The term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug, referred to as a patent term extension, or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the PTO, referred to as patent term adjustment. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved new chemical entity drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions in the United States cannot extend the term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent covering an approved drug or its method of use may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 Current issued patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter for GB-102 expires on dates ranging from 2031 to 2039, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged. Current issued patents and patent applications covering our clinical candidate GB-401 will also expire on dates ranging from 2031 to 2041, if the applications are issued and held valid if challenged. Our pending applications on additional methods of use of our clinical candidates, should they issue, will expire in 2039. We plan to file additional applications on aspects of our innovations that may have patent terms that extend beyond these dates. However, any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved products, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted on our patents or on third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our microparticle and implant technologies and novel prodrugs will depend on our success in enforcing the claims that have been granted or may grant. We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications that we have filed or may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any additional patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize drugs with similar mechanisms of action and/or duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 GB-102 patent coverage
 Patents solely owned by us
 We own a first patent family that generally describes our proprietary surface modifying microparticle technology that allows the microparticles to remain separate prior to in vivo administration and then aggregate in vivo into at least one microparticle of at least 500 microns that provides controlled drug delivery. Alternatively, our microparticles can be formed into an implant that is used in the eye. This family consists of one issued U.S. Patent (US 10,441,548) and two pending U.S. applications (US 2020/0000734 and US 2020/0000735) covering the GB-102 aggregating microparticle composition-of-matter and their pharmaceutical compositions. Several pending corresponding patent applications cover methods of use of these aggregated microparticles and their processes of manufacture. This patent family is now also in the national stage of prosecution in Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan. The expected year of expiration for these composition-of-matter patents, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2036, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We also own a second patent family that cover additional microparticle formulations and methods of manufacture, including for example suspensions of GB-102 and lyophilized solid GB-102 that have been treated to remove adhered air or gas. It consists of one issued U.S. Patent (US 11,160,870), two U.S. applications, and is currently in the national phase of prosecution in Australia, Canada, 
 20

China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, if issued, valid and enforceable, is 2038, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under U.S. or other national laws.
 We own a third patent family that discloses coordinated control of a number of processing factors that result in a significantly harder or more durable aggregated microparticle, and which may be used in the process of manufacture of our GB-102 product.

The family comprises one U.S. application (US 2021/085607). This patent family is now also in the national stage of prosecution in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and Russia. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, if issued, valid and enforceable, is 2039, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under U.S. or other national laws.
 Patent Filings Exclusively Licensed from JHU
 We have exclusively licensed from JHU a first patent family that claims microparticles with a hydrophobic polymeric core (such as PLGA or polylactic acid (PLA) or a combination of both PLGA and PLA) and a hydrophilic coating (such as PLGA permanently linked to polyethylene glycol) to reduce inflammation for intraocular injections and their methods of use. This patent family includes four U.S. Patents (US 8,889,193; US 9,566,242; US 9,937,130; and US 10,369,107). This patent family also currently includes one pending U.S. application, , as well as a corresponding patent application in Europe and a granted patent in Canada. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2031, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We have also exclusively licensed from JHU a second patent family, which covers sunitinib-encapsulated polymeric microparticles, including GB-102, and their use as therapeutic compositions to treat disorders of the eye. This patent family currently includes two U.S. pending applications, US 2017/0273901 and US 2019/0275001 and is also pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia. The application has been allowed in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Russia. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2035, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 A third patent family exclusively licensed from JHU discloses method for reducing neuronal damage in the eye that includes administration of a sustained release formulation of dual leucine kinase inhibitor in a polymeric particle, and wherein the dual leucine kinase inhibitor may be sunitinib. This family consists of two issued U.S. Patents, US 10,525,034 and US 11,013,719, one pending U.S. application, US 2021/0251959, and corresponding applications in Europe, China, Japan and Hong Kong. The application has been allowed in Japan. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2035, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 GB-401 patent coverage
 We own a fifth patent family that describes the composition of matter of a range of proprietary prodrugs, one of which is a prodrug of a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor that is in GB-401. This patent family provides the basis for compound (new chemical entity), pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use of these prodrugs. The family includes one pending U.S. patent application, US 2020/0031783, and corresponding applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia. The expected year of expiration for these composition-of-matter patents, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2038, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We own a sixth patent family that consists of an international application (WO 2021/237096) that describes microparticles and implants with high-drug loadings of GB-401, which we intend to file in the United States and other selected foreign countries on or before the deadline to do so.  The expected year of expiration for this patent family, if issued, valid and enforceable, is 2041, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of terms that may be available under U.S. or other national laws.
 The four patent families that we solely own described above covering GB-102 also cover aggregating microparticles that encapsulate GB-401, pharmaceutical compositions of these aggregating microparticles, and methods of use. Therefore, we have six patent families that cover GB-401 as a compound and in an aggregating microparticle, and their uses and manufacture.
 In addition, the first patent family exclusively licensed from JHU described above that describes polymeric microparticles has claims that cover GB-401, pharmaceutical compositions of these microparticles, and methods of use.

The first family is currently pending in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Japan. The second family is currently pending in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The expected year of expiration for these patent applications, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2037, without regard to any extensions, adjustments or restorations of term that may be available under national law. 
 License agreements
 Johns Hopkins University
 In June 2011, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with JHU, which has been amended from time to time, which we refer to as the JHU Agreement. Pursuant to the JHU Agreement, JHU granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to three patent families to research, develop, make, use and sell products and provide services in any field, and a non-exclusive license to use specified know-how and materials with a provision that JHU will not grant a license to know how and materials to any other commercial entity. The JHU first patent family describes microparticles with a hydrophobic polymeric core (such as PLGA or PLA or a combination of both PLGA and PLA) and a hydrophilic coating (such as PLGA permanently linked to polyethylene glycol) to reduce inflammation for intraocular injections and their methods of use, which technology is incorporated into our GB-102 product candidate. The JHU licensed fourth and fifth patent families cover potential future technologies. See “Intellectual Property” above for additional description of the JHU patent families.
 22

In September 2015, the JHU Agreement was amended to include the JHU second patent family which covers sunitinib-encapsulated polymeric microparticles, including GB-102, and their use as therapeutic compositions to treat disorders of the eye. Under the terms of the amended JHU Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee, with a remaining amount to be paid upon the occurrence of certain events. We also agreed to pay an additional one-time, non-refundable fee of $100,000 on the occurrence of the first commercial sale of a product falling under the claims of a patent in the second patent family.
 In April 2016, the JHU Agreement was further amended to include a third patent family which discloses a method for reducing neuronal damage in the eye that includes administration of a sustained release formulation of a dual leucine kinase inhibitor in a polymeric particle, and wherein the dual leucine kinase inhibitor may be sunitinib, and thus is relevant to GB-102. Under the terms of the amended JHU Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee, and a milestone payment for the grant of the first patent. We also agreed to use our best efforts to develop a licensed product under the third patent family and enter into a Phase I clinical trial on or before April 2019, and to have cumulatively spent several million dollars on research and development within six years of execution of the amendment.
 Upon execution of the JHU Agreement in 2011, we paid JHU an upfront license fee in the low tens of thousands of dollars and issued to JHU a low single digit percentage of our equity interests as of such date. We have also reimbursed JHU for the prosecution and maintenance costs incurred by JHU for the licensed patent rights prior to our entering into the JHU Agreement, and we are responsible for all of the ongoing costs relating to the prosecution and maintenance of the JHU patent rights licensed to us. We also agreed to pay minimum annual royalties in the tens of thousands of dollars per year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product or service.
 The JHU Agreement further requires single digit running royalties on our annual net sales, which may be reduced by 50% of any payments we make to third parties for freedom to operate, up to a maximum credit of 50% of the running royalty rate otherwise due to JHU. Royalties must be paid on products that fall within a patent claim of an issued and unexpired patent or a pending patent application that has not been finally rejected or is pending for less than seven years. We also must pay developmental milestones for achieving certain clinical progression events, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousand dollars per event, which in the aggregate, total less than $2 million per product. Under the JHU Agreement, prior to the Kala Agreement renegotiation described below, we were responsible for paying each developmental milestone payment for the first three products to achieve such milestone, and milestones for the second and third products are reduced by 50%. We further agreed to pay a percentage of any sublicense consideration we receive. Once commercial, we expect ongoing royalties on sales to be in the low single digits.
 The JHU Agreement will remain effective until (i) the later of the expiration date of the last-to-expire patents covered under the JHU Agreement or 20 years from the effective date; (ii) the termination by either party upon the bankruptcy or uncured breach of the other party or (iii) if we terminate the JHU Agreement, with a 90-day notification period. We may terminate the entire agreement or on a patent by patent basis if desired, subject to the 90-day notification period.
 Kala Pharmaceuticals
 A dispute arose between us, JHU and Kala, over rights licensed to us and Kala by JHU. In October 2014, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement, or the Kala Agreement, with Kala and JHU, which settled all pending disputes and amended our and Kala’s existing license agreements with JHU and created new rights and obligations among the parties.
 Under the Kala Agreement, each of Kala and us provided the other with a royalty-free, exclusive sublicense with respect to certain intellectual property rights granted by JHU in limited fields of use. Specifically, we provided Kala with an exclusive sublicense for the use of a particle with specific characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material through mucus, mucin or a mucosal barrier (provided that such delivery does not involve administration via injection to the eye), or the Kala Field of Use, and Kala provided us with an exclusive sublicense to the use of a particle with specific characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material to the eye via injection (excluding such use of any particle comprising or consisting of loteprednol etabonate). Kala also agreed not to use a particle with those specific characteristics that include sunitinib in the Kala Field of Use under the license from us or JHU. Neither we nor Kala owe JHU any payments under its existing JHU agreement with respect to the sublicenses granted to the other. Both we and Kala hold rights to sublicense our respective rights in connection with a future collaboration arrangement and subject to any such sublicensee being bound by the applicable terms of the Kala Agreement.
 Under the Kala Agreement, JHU agreed to a number of financial concessions to both us and Kala. The payments under the existing JHU agreements were modified by reducing all milestones and minimum annual royalties by 25%, including the development milestone payments due for the first licensed product; the development milestone payments due for the first license product were each extended by one year; development milestone payments for the second and third licensed products were eliminated; and the commercial milestone payments for the first commercial sale of a licensed product were reduced by 50% in the United States. New sales-based milestones were added for the second and third licensed products. Upon the second licensed product under the JHU Agreement reaching a certain level of sales or receiving sublicense royalty income, we are required to pay $100,000 plus the amounts of the eliminated development 
 23

milestones and reduced first commercial sale milestone. For the third licensed product, on reaching the same level of sales or receiving sublicense royalty income, we are required to pay $150,000 plus the amounts of the eliminated development milestones and reduced first commercial sale milestone. In addition, we, Kala and JHU released each other from any liability or claims known to Kala and us as of the Kala Agreement and arising out of the actions leading to, and related to the subject of, the Kala Agreement.
 The Kala Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all the patent rights that are the subject of the Kala Agreement. We may terminate one or more of the licenses or sublicenses granted to us in the Kala Agreement on a country-by-country basis for convenience upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Kala. We or Kala may terminate one or more the sublicenses granted to the other party under the JHU patent rights if the other party, or its employees, officers, directors, agents or representatives, takes certain steps to oppose, attempt to invalidate or prevent the issuance of any of the patent rights directly licensed to the terminating party by JHU.
 AffaMed Therapeutics
 In July 2019, we entered into a letter agreement with AffaMed Project Limited, or AffaMed, in connection with their purchase of our Series C preferred stock, which we refer to as the AffaMed Letter. Under the AffaMed Letter, we granted AffaMed a right of first negotiation, or the Option, to enter into a license agreement to exclusively develop, register and commercialize GB-102 solely in the territories of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and South Korea. The Option expired on July 31, 2021 and we have no further obligation to AffaMed to license rights to GB-102, and we no longer have any limits on our ability to develop, register and commercialize GB-102 in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and South Korea.
 Recent transactions
 In December 2021, we entered into a cross-licensing agreement with a private company pursuant to which we acquired exclusive rights to several small molecules for use in the fields of ophthalmology and otology and by which we granted back exclusive rights to certain small molecules for use outside the fields of ophthalmology and otology.  Per the terms of the agreement, we are required to work diligently to develop one or more products, make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones, and pay royalties upon commercial sales of products that we develop incorporating these molecules.
 In March 2022, we acquired a private company in the United States with certain gene therapy technology and preclinical data.  The company was purchased for cash, and no further payments are required until FDA approval of a product based upon the acquired assets and the sale or utilization of any priority review voucher that may be granted in connection with such approval.
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is 
 24

submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans.
 If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
 FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to disclose, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Furthermore, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually.
 FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, FDA begins an in-depth review. Under PDUFA, FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. NDAs for most standard review drug products are reviewed within twelve months from submission of NDAs for new molecular entities, or NMEs, and within ten months from submission of NDAs for non-NMEs. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. NDAs for most priority review drug products are reviewed within eight months from submission of NDAs for NMEs and within six months from submission of NDAs for non-NMEs. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance 
 25

with current good manufacturing practices is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Post-approval requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, providing the FDA with updated safety information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and promotion and advertising requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed or promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices after approval. Drug 
 26

manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or take other administrative or judicial enforcement actions if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. A recent opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, held that a generic manufacturer launching a product with a patented method-of-use carve out may, nonetheless, still be liable for patent infringement by inducement based on certain information in the label and external information such as press releases and product catalogues. GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 7 F.4th 1320 ‎‎(Fed. Cir. 2021) reh’g denied, en banc, Glaxosmithkline LLC v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 3812 (Fed. Cir., Feb. 11, 2022).  
 If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA may not receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the period of exclusivity.
 Patent term extension
 27

After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue development or approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Hatch-Waxman patent certification and the 30-month stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application enables the applicant in certain circumstances to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings in approving a similar product or published literature in support of its application. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for a new or improved formulation, a new route of administration or a new use of a previously approved product.
 Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the 
 28

applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s prior findings of safety or effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements
 In the United States, pharmaceutical company activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for 
 29

money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government priced reporting purposes.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported information is made publicly available on a searchable website.  Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 Commercial distribution of products requires compliance with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. Sales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings.

Pharmaceutical insurance coverage and health care reform
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, include changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. 
 There have been executive, legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, replace, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain aspects, of the ACA.  For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included, among other things, a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.”  In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge constitutionality of the individual mandate.  It is unclear whether there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA.   Further, prior to the Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and closed on August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the ACA that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or other healthcare measures on our business.
 31

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Medicare reductions phase back in starting with a 1% reduction in effect from April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 before increasing to the full 2% reduction.  Moreover, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. By way of example, in December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. On September 9, 2021, the Biden Administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The HHS plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to (1) give Medicare authority to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, (2) authorize HHS to negotiate Medicaid supplemental rebates on behalf of states, (3) allow employer-based, ACA marketplace and commercial health insurance plans to access Medicare negotiated drug prices, (4) place a cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and redistribute a higher proportion of drug costs to Part D and manufacturers, (5) mandate purchase of the least costly-alternative and to institute value-based or outcomes-based pricing arrangements, (6) disincentivize drug price increases, (8) facilitate approval and prescription of biosimilar and generic drugs, (9) increase drug pricing transparency, (10) prohibit certain types of rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, and (11) develop drug pricing models by tying price to outcomes. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare authority to negotiate drug prices and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent new statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will likely be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for such product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Finally, in the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most European Union member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and the European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 27 full time employees, all in the United States, 7 of whom have an M.D. or Ph.D. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive and cash-based performance bonus plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.  
 Properties and facilities
 Our principal executive office is located Redwood City, California, and consists of 2,560 square feet of office space under a lease which expires in August 2022. We use this facility for operations and administrative purposes. We also have a facility located in Baltimore, Maryland, which consists of 15,649 square feet of office and laboratory space under a lease which expires in June 2023. We 
 32

use the Maryland facility for our internal research and development activities. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
 Legal proceedings
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.
