Item 1. Business.
General
CSS Industries, Inc. (“CSS” or the “Company”) is a creative consumer products company, focused on the seasonal, gift and craft categories. For these design-driven categories, the Company engages in the creative development, manufacture, procurement, distribution and sale of our products with an omni-channel approach focused primarily on mass market retailers. 
Seasonal The seasonal category includes holiday gift packaging items such as ribbon, bows, greeting cards, bags, tags and gift card holders, in addition to specific holiday-themed decorations, accessories, and activities, such as Easter egg dyes and novelties and Valentine's Day classroom exchange cards. These products are sold to mass market and online retailers, and production forecasts for these products are generally known well in advance of shipment. 
Gift The gift category includes products designed to celebrate certain life events or special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, or the birth of a child. Products include ribbons and bows, floral accessories, infant products, journals, gift card holders, all occasion boxed greeting cards, memory books, scrapbooks, stationery and other items that commemorate life's celebrations. Products in this category are primarily sold into mass, specialty and online retailers, floral and packaging wholesalers and distributors, and are generally ordered on a replenishment basis throughout the year. 
Craft The craft category includes sewing patterns, ribbons and trims, buttons, knitting needles, needle arts and kids' crafts. These products are sold to mass market, specialty, and online retailers, and are generally ordered on a replenishment basis throughout the year.
CSS’ product breadth provides its retail customers the opportunity to use a single vendor for much of their seasonal, gift and craft product requirements. A substantial portion of CSS’ products are manufactured and packaged in the United States and warehoused and distributed from facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, with the remainder sourced from foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. The Company also has a manufacturing facility in India that produces certain craft products, including trims, braids and tassels, and also has a distribution facility in India. The Company’s products are sold to its customers by national and regional account sales managers, sales representatives, product specialists and by a network of independent manufacturers’ representatives. CSS maintains purchasing offices in Hong Kong and China to administer Asian sourcing opportunities. 
The overall objective of the Company is to grow profitable sales and improve return on invested capital ("ROIC") through five strategic pillars. These strategic pillars include:
*Defend the base business - Design, product innovation, category leadership

* | Expand to adjacent categories with a focus on brands - Focus on fragmented markets, brands, omni-channel

*Build an omni-channel business model - Dedicated resources, leverage technology

* | Improve ROIC by maximizing margins while minimizing capital investment - Streamline and focus on economic value add and working capital

*Build a collaborative, One CSS culture - Communication, accountability, diversity

CSS operates sixteen manufacturing and/or distribution facilities located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, the United Kingdom, Australia and India. A description of the Company’s product lines and related manufacturing and/or distribution facilities is as follows:

• | Ribbon and bows are primarily manufactured and warehoused in nine facilities located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, South Carolina and Alabama. The manufacturing process is vertically integrated. Non-woven ribbon and bow products are primarily made from polypropylene resin, a petroleum-based product, which is mixed with color pigment, melted and pressed through an extruder. Large rolls of extruded film go through various combinations of manufacturing processes before being made into bows or packaged on ribbon spools or reels as required by various markets and customers. Woven fabric ribbons are manufactured domestically or imported from Mexico and Asia. Imported woven products are either narrow woven or converted from bulk rolls of wide width textiles. Domestic woven products are narrow woven. 


• | Journals, educational products, memory books, scrapbooks, stationery, infant products, and other gift items are imported from Asian manufacturers and warehoused and distributed primarily from two distribution facilities in Alabama.


• | Floral accessories, including pot covers, foil, waxed tissue, shred, aisle runners, corsage bags and other paper and film products, are manufactured in a facility located in New Hampshire or imported from Mexico. Manufacturing includes gravure and flexo printing, waxing and converting. Products are warehoused and distributed from a distribution facility in Pennsylvania. 


• | Sewing patterns are purchased and distributed from a third party printer and are also manufactured and distributed from a facility located in Kansas. Sewing patterns are also warehoused and distributed from a distribution facility in the United Kingdom and a distribution facility in Australia. 


• | Certain craft items, including trims, braids and tassels, are manufactured from two facilities in India and imported and distributed from a facility in Illinois.

Other products including, but not limited to, buttons, knitting needles, needle arts, kids crafts, boxed greeting cards, gift tags, gift card holders, gift bags, gift wrap, decorative tissue paper, classroom exchange Valentine's Day products, Easter products, and decorations are produced to the specifications of CSS and are imported primarily from Asian manufacturers and warehoused and distributed from facilities in Illinois, Alabama, and Pennsylvania.
The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2019 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
During our fiscal 2019, CSS experienced no material difficulties in obtaining raw materials or finished goods from suppliers.
Intellectual Property Rights CSS has a number of copyrights, patents, tradenames, trademarks and intellectual property licenses which are used in connection with its products. Substantially all of its designs and artwork are protected by copyright. Intellectual property license rights which CSS has obtained are viewed as especially important to the success of its classroom exchange Valentine's Day cards and stickers. It is CSS’ view that its operations are not dependent upon any individual patent, tradename, trademark, copyright or intellectual property license. The collective value of CSS’ intellectual property is viewed as substantial, and CSS seeks to protect its rights in all patents, copyrights, tradenames, trademarks and intellectual property licenses.
Sales and Marketing Most of CSS’ products are sold in the United States and Canada by national and regional account sales managers, sales representatives, product specialists and by a network of independent manufacturers’ representatives. CSS maintains permanent showrooms in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Hong Kong and Australia where buyers for retail customers will typically visit for a presentation and review of new product lines. Products are also displayed and presented in showrooms maintained by various independent manufacturers’ representatives in major cities in the United States and Canada. Relationships are developed with key retail customers by CSS sales personnel and independent manufacturers’ representatives. Social stationery products are sold by sales representatives that specialize in the gift and specialty channel, as well as by key account representatives. Craft ribbon and bow products are also sold through sales representatives or independent manufacturers’ representatives to wholesale distributors and independent small retailers who serve the floral, craft and retail packaging trades. The Company also sells custom products to private label customers, to other

social expression companies, and to converters of the Company’s ribbon products. Custom products are sold by both independent manufacturers’ representatives and CSS sales managers. 
Customers are generally mass market retailers, discount department stores, specialty chains, warehouse clubs, drug and food chains, dollar stores, office supply stores, online retailers, independent card, gift and floral shops and retail teachers’ stores. Sales to Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for 24% of our sales during fiscal 2019 and sales to Jo-Ann Stores, LLC and its affiliates accounted for 13% of our sales during fiscal 2019. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s sales in fiscal 2019. Our ten largest customers, which include mass market retailers, warehouse clubs, national craft chains and national drug store chains, accounted for 66% of our sales in our fiscal 2019. Approximately 70% of the Company’s net sales are attributable to gift and craft products with the remainder attributable to seasonal (Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Easter and back to-school) products. Approximately 22% of CSS’ net sales relate to the Christmas season. Seasonal products are generally designed and marketed beginning up to 18 to 20 months before the holiday event and manufactured during an eight to ten month production cycle. Due to these long lead time requirements, timely communication with third party factories, licensors, customers and independent manufacturers’ representatives is critical to the timely production of seasonal products. Sales terms for our seasonal products do not generally require payment until just before or just after the holiday, in accordance with industry practice. CSS products, with some customer specific exceptions, are not sold under guaranteed or return privilege terms. The Company has certain limited products, primarily sewing patterns, that are on consignment at mass market retailers and the Company recognizes the sale as products are sold to end consumers at point-of-sale terminals.
Competition among retailers in the sale of the Company’s products to end users is intense. CSS seeks to assist retailers in developing merchandising programs designed to enable the retailers to meet their revenue and profit objectives while appealing to their consumers’ tastes. These objectives are met through the development and manufacture of custom configured and designed products and merchandising programs. CSS’ years of experience in merchandising program development and product quality are key competitive advantages in helping retailers meet their objectives.
Competition CSS competes with various domestic and foreign companies in each of its seasonal, gift and craft categories. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company while many are smaller, private companies that we compete with across our product lines. CSS believes its products are competitively positioned in their primary markets. Since competition is based primarily on category knowledge, timely delivery, creative design, price and, with respect to seasonal products, the ability to serve major retail customers with single, combined product shipments for each holiday event, CSS believes that its focus on products, combined with consistent service levels, allows it to compete effectively in its core markets.
Backlog Production forecasts for products within our seasonal category are generally known well in advance of shipment. Orders for products within our gift and craft categories are generally ordered on a just-in-time replenishment basis by our customers and an order backlog does not typically exist, except when major program resets occur. 
Employees
At May 28, 2019, approximately 2,000 persons were employed by CSS (increasing to approximately 2,400 as seasonal employees are added). The Company believes that relationships with its employees are good. Due to the seasonal nature of certain of its businesses, the number of production employees fluctuates during the year. 
With the exception of the bargaining unit at the ribbon manufacturing facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, which totaled 86 employees as of May 28, 2019, CSS employees are not represented by labor unions. The collective bargaining agreement with the labor union representing the Hagerstown-based production and maintenance employees remains in effect until December 31, 2020. Historically, we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreements without any disruption of operating activities.
Acquisitions
The Company endeavors to build on existing relationships with seasonal, gift and craft customers by expanding and diversifying its product lines to grow its presence in the largest retailers in North America. This includes both capitalizing on opportunities for organic growth in existing businesses as well as acquiring companies which fit into appropriate acquisition parameters. Though we are pausing on acquisitions in the near term, we will continue to actively meet with seasonal, gift and craft companies to review and assess potential acquisition targets. Historically, significant revenue growth at CSS has come through acquisitions. Over the long term, management anticipates that it will continue to consider acquisitions as a strategy to stimulate growth.

On June 1, 2018, a subsidiary of the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the business and net assets of Fitlosophy, Inc. ("Fitlosophy") for $2,500,000 in cash and transaction costs of $25,000, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2019. In addition to the $2,500,000 paid at closing, the Company may pay up to an additional $10,500,000 of contingent earn-out consideration, in cash, if net sales of certain products meet or exceed five different thresholds during the period from the acquisition date through March 31, 2023. The contingent consideration payments will be paid, if at all, generally within 20 days after the end of each rolling twelve-month measurement period (quarterly through March 31, 2023). At the date of acquisition, the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was $1,600,000. As of March 31, 2019, we updated our assessment of the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $1,366,000 which is included in accrued other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Fitlosophy is devoted to creating, marketing, and distributing innovative products that inspire people to develop healthy habits by focusing on effective goal-setting through journaling. Products include a complete line of fitness and wellness planning products all sold under the fitlosophyTM, live life fitTM and fitbookTM brands. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of $1,390,000 was recorded as goodwill. The Company determined that a triggering event occurred due to the fact that the Company’s total stockholders’ equity was in excess of the Company's market capitalization. Given this circumstance, the Company bypassed the option to assess qualitative factors to determine the existence of impairment and proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of its impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,390,000. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no goodwill.
On November 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets and business of Simplicity Creative Group ("Simplicity") from Wilton Brands LLC ("Wilton") for a total consideration of $69,617,000 and transaction costs of $3,411,000. Simplicity is a leading provider of home sewing patterns, decorative trims, knitting and crocheting tools, needle arts and kids' crafts products under the Simplicity®, Wrights®, Boye®, Dimensions®, and Perler® brand names. Simplicity's products are sold to mass-market retailers, specialty fabric and craft chains, wholesale distributors and online customers. The Company primarily financed the acquisition with borrowings of $60,000,000 under its credit facility. A portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow for certain indemnification obligations. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of $9,642,000 was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill was subsequently written off as a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
On December 13, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets and business of The McCall Pattern Company and certain affiliated subsidiaries ("McCall"), for $13,914,000 in cash, plus transaction costs of $1,484,000. McCall designs, manufactures, and sells home sewing patterns under the McCall’s®, Butterick®, Kwik Sew® and Vogue Patterns® brand names. McCall is a leading provider of home sewing patterns, selling to mass market retailers, specialty fabric and craft chains, and wholesale distributors. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and resulted in a bargain purchase due to the fair value of the net assets acquired of $33,528,000 exceeding the amount paid. In connection with this bargain purchase, the Company recorded a gain of $19,614,000 in the consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2017. 
On July 8, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Lawrence Schiff Silk Mills, Inc. ("Schiff") for $1,125,000 in cash. Schiff was a leading U.S. manufacturer and distributor of narrow woven ribbon prior to its April 2016 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and resulted in a bargain purchase due to the fair value of the net assets acquired of $1,501,000 exceeding the amount paid. In connection with this bargain purchase, the Company recorded a gain of $376,000 in the consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2017.
