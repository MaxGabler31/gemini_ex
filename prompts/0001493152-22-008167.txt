Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are engaged in the development, production and marketing of innovative visual solutions composed of imaging equipment, cloud and software based image processing (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and additional algorithm methodologies). Some of our products that utilize our micro ScoutCam™ technology are used in medical procedures as well as various applications in other industries. Our current business model is a business-to-business (B2B) approach in which we seek to identify target businesses interested in integrating our micro ScoutCam™ technology, or commissioning individual projects using our technology. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from applications of our micro ScoutCam™ technology within the medical, defense and aerospace fields. We have recently begun examining additional applications for our visual solutions portfolio (composed of image acquisition, data collection and storage and image processing), including Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and Condition Based Monitoring (CBM), as well as additional industry sectors such as aviation, automotive, industrial non-destructing-testing industries energy and maritime (we refer to these applications and sectors as I4.0) We plan to further expand our activity in these non-medical spaces.
 

Pictured above (from left to right) are the Company’s micro ScoutCamTM 1.0 Lum and micro ScoutCam™ 1.2.

Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013 under the name Intellisense Solutions Inc. We were initially engaged in the business of developing web portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sale of vegetarian food products over the Internet. However, we were unable to execute our original business plan, develop significant operations or achieve commercial sales.
 
We received initial funding in March 2014 in the aggregate amount of $19,980 through the sale of common stock to two of our former officers and directors, who purchased in the aggregate 1,998,000 shares of our common stock at $0.01 per share.
 
On January 10, 2019, we formed Canna Patch Ltd., or Canna Patch, an Israeli corporation, of which 90% was initially owned by our Company, and the remaining 10% owned by Rafael Ezra, Canna Patch’s Chief Technology Officer. Canna Patch did not have any operations and on December 4, 2019, we sold 100% of our holdings in Canna Patch.
 
On September 16, 2019, Intellisense and Medigus Ltd., an Israeli company traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, entered into an Exchange Agreement (as defined herein). For additional information about the Exchange Agreement, refer to – “ CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below.

On December 30, 2019, we acquired ScoutCam Ltd. As a result of our acquisition of ScoutCam Ltd., we now own all of ScoutCam Ltd.’s issued and outstanding share capital and have integrated and adopted ScoutCam Ltd.’s business into our Company as our primary business activity.
 
ScoutCam Ltd. was formed in the State of Israel on January 3, 2019 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medigus and commenced operations on March 1, 2019. ScoutCam Ltd. was incorporated as part of a reorganization of Medigus, which was designed to distinguish ScoutCam Ltd.’s miniaturized imaging business, or the micro ScoutCam™ portfolio, from Medigus’ other operations and to enable Medigus to form a separate business unit with dedicated resources focused on the promotion of such technology. On December 1, 2019, Medigus and ScoutCam Ltd. consummated a certain Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, which transferred and assigned certain assets and intellectual property rights related to its miniaturized imaging business. For additional information about the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below. On May 18, 2020, in connection with the Arkin Transaction (as defined below), the Company and Medigus entered into a certain Side Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”), whereby the parties agreed to amend certain terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement and the License Agreement. For additional information about the Letter Agreement, refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below.
 
On April 20, 2020, ScoutCam Ltd. entered into an Amended and Restated Intercompany Services Agreement with Medigus (the “Intercompany Services Agreement”), which effectively amended and restated an intercompany services agreement dated May 30, 2019. For additional information about the Intercompany Services Agreement, refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our vision is to improve the performance of organizations by offering prestigious tools that enhance the visual technological capabilities and maximize AI analysis capabilities for companies across a variety of industries. Our mission is to become a global leader providing innovative, off-the-shelf and custom-tailored visualization and analysis solutions to organizations across a variety of industries based on highly resistant cameras and supplementary technologies. We are currently focused on custom-tailored solutions, and as a result have a very limited offering of off-the-shelf products, which are used mainly as models for new uses of our technology and capabilities rather than as a major source of revenue. Moreover, as we focus only on the visualization apparatus and supporting components, including for example a small camera (that consists of a miniature Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor or CMOS video sensor, optics, filters, electronics, housing and cables), illumination, cleaning methods (e.g., irrigation), and/or a mechanical structure based on the customer’s needs, in most cases our products are components of the customer’s end-user products rather than independent end-user products.
 
Certain illustrative examples of our component parts that have been previously integrated into our clients’ end-user products include:

The Company’s micro ScoutCam™ 6.5 Lum, pictured above, was integrated into a NASA-commissioned project, and as a result it became the first micro camera utilized in orbit when it was successfully operated outside the International Space Station in May 2015.
 

Pictured above is a single-use visualization solution that was developed and sold to A.M. Surgical, which was designed to replace expensive and bulky reusable endoscopes used in carpal tunnel surgery by their Stratos surgical device. We prepared both wired and wireless versions. Our wireless device was cleared for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is compliant with FCC regulations.
 
Our business model in the medical domain includes engaging companies seeking to add video visualization to their existing or new product(s) or considering the development of new products that include micro video visualization. Accordingly, our customer base is exclusively comprised of businesses, and therefore we are entirely removed from marketing, manufacturing, selling and distributing end-user products to consumers. Our engagement with businesses is ordinarily conducted in two phases. During the first phase, we conduct the research and development that is required in order to specify, design, develop, and produce the designated visualization apparatus, all for an agreed-upon compensation amount (e.g., a non-recurrent engineering fee). During the second phase, we manufacture the apparatus and sell it to the customer for an agreed-upon transfer price. In some cases, by customer request, we offer complete ‘turn-key’ contracts in which we are responsible for most or all product phases, from the specifications phase to the provision of completed components or products that are packaged and ready for sale. In such cases, we may conduct necessary regulatory tests and handle required regulatory approvals. In addition, we may also be responsible, as necessary, for packaging, sterilization, labeling, and shipment.
 
In the I4.0 domain, which target PdM and CBM applications, we intend to engage with companies who wish to increase the monitoring capabilities of different elements of a device using our visual monitoring solutions (these include build of image acquisition, data collection and storage, and image processing capabilities based on AI, ML and additional algorithm concepts). Based on our product portfolio with customized solutions as needed, this will allow our customers to receive alerts on anomalies and failures as they are occur on the monitored component, analyze and track trends and development of the anomaly and predict any impending failure of the component as a result of such anomaly over time and usage.
 
As a result, we expect customers to benefit from a reduction in downtime of their monitored equipment, using the prediction capabilities of the platform to efficiently plan maintenance work on future faulty components. Another outcome we expect is more cost effective management of resources, since components will only need to be replaced as a result of their actual condition rather than a strict maintenance schedule.
 
The use of an image based platform in the fields of PdM and CBM provides richer and more informative data and insights not available with traditional sensing methods. Together with the AI and ML models customized for the relevant use cases, we expect this will provide customers with a clearer view of the status of their equipment, increasing revenues by saving on direct expenses and increasing the uptime of their equipment.
 
Our customers include technology-based companies and organizations, which are mainly large, well-established, international corporations. Larger corporations provide financial stability, large purchased quantities, recurring revenue, and valid forecasts for extended durations. In addition, we engage customers from various industries, such as biomedical, aerospace, energy, transportation, certain sensitive or classified industries, security and defense, and research.
 
In order to locate and secure new customers we employ both active and passive marketing strategies. As part of our active approach, we employ three business development managers, in addition to other consultants, who analyze target industries and assess whether visualization solutions may add value to companies operating in those industries. Once we have identified a potentially relevant industry, we approach a variety of target companies and market the benefits of integrating our visualization solutions into their products. In addition, in order to assist us in identifying such industries and target companies, we consult with subject matter experts from various industries.

In addition to the active marketing strategy described above, we also employ a multitude of other marketing channels in order to increase the exposure of our services to relevant industries. These marketing channels include advertising, participating in relevant tradeshows and conferences, web-marketing, which includes a well maintained Company website, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), social media presence, distribution of press-releases in target countries, as well as conventional marketing means, including brochures and presentations. Additionally, we issue industry-specific marketing materials that are tailored to highlight the relevant features of our technology to a specific target industry.
 
Our marketing measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | engaging third party companies as territorial representatives in key markets; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | initiating business engagements based on leads received through our website, through active web based tools for lead generation, or via other methods or means; 
● | conducting initial technical scopes and discussions together with such prospects in order to evaluate the feasibility of their contemplated projects; 
● | maintaining an updated and detailed website presenting our core competency, solutions, use cases and proven track record; 
● | promoting our website in different search engines and other digital forums through SEO campaigning as well as other proactive digital marketing measures; 
● | employing certain social media platforms for campaigning and advertising; 
● | reconnecting with our large database, which includes a multitude of past prospects; 
● | developing and refining marketing communications materials, including digital and printed brochures; and 
● | participating in major vision technology exhibitions as well as industry specific events. 

 
In addition to our business development efforts that are mainly based on currently existing or future customer needs, we aim to identify new market opportunities. These efforts include systematical analysis of industrial fields as well as medical fields and procedures in order to identify where visualization solutions, including image analysis, might benefit and attract value. When a potential opportunity is identified, we protect our rights by establishing relevant intellectual property safeguards, develop various prototypes that may be relevant for the specific application and engage key opinion leaders in that field to validate the feasibility of our solutions. In the medical domain, given that we are not a business-to-consumer, or B2C, company, our business model does not include commercialization of end-user products; nevertheless, we seek to partner with relevant companies to convert our innovative prototypes into market-ready products, complete the required regulatory clearances, and commercialize them based on revenue share models. Regarding the I4.0 domain, we are in the process of transforming our products and projects into market ready solutions, aiming to commercialize our platform as part of a SaaS model offering with multi-year contracts which include required hardware, software, cloud service and ongoing support and maintenance.
 
Regarding project based solutions, we have certain internal procedures in place once a potential customer is identified which help provide a roadmap for the ensuing working relationship. Prior to any formal engagement with a potential customer, two of our departments – business development and R&D – work in parallel to define an understanding with the customer that will ordinarily incorporate two phases: (a) an R&D phase, during which the R&D team develops a custom-tailored visualization component that synthesizes our technology and skill with the customer’s stated requirements, specifications, and business constraints, and which phase generally includes a formal agreement with respect to a Non-Recurrent Engineering (NRE) fee that is typically payable according to a pre-defined set of milestones; and (b) a production phase, during which we manufacture and supply the component parts for an agreed upon transfer price.

Over the years, we have offered and implemented tailor-made pricing schemes that allows us to separately price services rendered during the previously described first phase. Pricing of this first phase is typically prepared by the engineering team, which provides an assessment of the anticipated costs associated with the R&D of the project, which price will depend on a given customer’s specifications and project vision. Such costs may include, inter alia, engineering labor, any contracts with sub-contractors, tooling, off-the-shelf and newly designed components, materials, prototypes production, testing, management overhead, and travel costs. Once we have completed our cost estimation for the R&D phase, we issue a quote for such services to the customer.
 
In order to develop a transfer price in connection with the aforementioned second phase, the expected Bill-Of Material (BOM) and Cost-Of-Good Sold (COGS) are established and we develop a quotation accordingly. Often times there are certain modifications to the original project outlined and agreed upon in the R&D phase, which might necessitate an increase or decrease to the pricing of the overall project. For that reason, we tend to include a certain margin of flexibility in the final target transfer price. In addition, we usually link the end transfer price with both annual and per-order Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ), in order to reflect the actual production quantity of the COGS as well as to commercially incentivize the customer to order larger quantities.
 
Both the negotiation process and the contract drafting are usually done in collaboration with the customer, such that both sides can verify throughout the process that the final agreement meets their technological and business expectations. Furthermore, we seek to maintain close contact with the customer throughout the two phases of our engagement, including for example, by way of teleconferences, virtual and actual meetings, document exchanges, on-site visits, and reporting of any completion of predefined milestones.
 
Regarding our off the shelf products, the NRE phase in project based commercial interactions is not relevant, and the pricing model is set up front based on the cost, margin and value that the product creates.
 
Our Customers
 
Currently, we have one major customer that is expected to generate most of our forecasted revenue in the near term: a large international bio-med company that is developing a visualization component for its minimally-invasive surgical device. In addition to the foregoing material customer, we are engaged in initial negotiations with multiple potential customers operating in a variety of sectors, including biomedical, aerospace, aviation, automotive, energy, military and security, and others. In the I4.0 segment, aviation industries (both manned and unmanned) are currently the source of our greatest level of interest, with recent growing interest coming from the transportation (specifically railway) and energy (specifically wind turbine) sectors. We are pursuing these potential engagements with the goal of securing proof of concepts and launching commercial pilots that may then materialize into multi-year production contracts. We are in various stages of engagement with a variety of customers in all the above mentioned industries.
 
In the biomedical space, for example, we generally seek to partner with medical device and pharmaceutical companies that develop endoscopes with or without additional functionality. This variation allows the endoscope to be introduced into anatomical parts that were previously (prior to adopting ScoutCam’s visualization solution) not accessible within the video-endoscope space either because of outer diameter limitations and/or price. To this end, we focus on single-use products that accommodate the global trend to transition from expensive, multi-use products that require a thorough cleaning protocol, but which cannot be sterilized, to single-use products.
 
Lastly, we have recently mobilized efforts to market the possibility of employing our visualization technology and solutions for the purposes of monitoring sensitive mechanical structures and elements in the aviation sector, engaging on a pilot basis with the Israeli Air Force regarding their helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles and with several defense companies. Such an application complements global market trends associated with Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things, in which machines are programmed to test themselves and their production output, which then automatically alerts the processor of any potential problems at the outset of an endeavor.

Competition
 
There are currently several companies that offer small cameras, including, but not limited to, Opcom, Fujikura-Picoramedic, Awaiba, Fisba, and Misumi. Unlike these competitors, we offer customized solutions, which include additional components as needed. Other companies, such as IntraVu, Medit, and SPI Engineering, offer complete, small diameter, off-the shelf endoscopes/borescopes. Our focus, however, is on customizing and integrating our solutions into a given customer’s device. Certain companies, such as Enable, Myriad Fiber Imaging Tech., Inc., and Precision Optics, act as our direct competitors, since they offer similar services to those that we offer.
 
In addition, there are currently many companies that develop and provide monitoring solutions for PdM and CBM. These monitoring solutions can be the sensor itself, data collection and storage, AI processing, or a combination of these capabilities. The CBM and PdM solutions are usually based on traditional sensing solutions such as vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensors. Based on our research and discussions with customers, we believe these traditional sensing methods are limited in their ability to provide an in depth view of the condition of the monitored components and usually alert on the occurrence of an anomaly when component failure has already occurred, which is too late in some cases. From the AI perspective, there are several vendors providing off-the-shelf AI capabilities which then require customization per market, use case, and/or data source. Our more holistic approach and reliance on image based solutions creates richer and more informative data, leveraged by AI and ML algorithms, enabling our customers to deploy predictive maintenance programs.
 
Proprietary Rights and Technology
 
As we develop customized components and/or products per market needs or per specific customer requirements, our various projects are constantly in different stages of development, including: planning, early R&D for a proof of concept, R&D for a prototype, final product/component development, engineering necessary for a production-ready version, and production of initial batches.
 
We currently own a total of six patent families which we consider material to our business and operating success. Our intellectual property rights include patents and patent applications that were transferred to us by Medigus as part of the Addendum No. 1 to Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Addendum”), the License Agreement and the Letter Agreement, additional patent assets developed by ScoutCam and an asset assigned to us from a third party. For additional information about the License Agreement refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below. Under the Addendum, and subject to certain limitations as further set forth therein, Medigus transferred to us the following material patent families in exchange for a license in connection with the marketing and sale of the Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler:

If ultimately issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, such patent would be expected to expire in early 2042.
 
Employment
 
We currently have approximately 35 full-time (or near full-time) employees. This number is expected to grow. We may recruit additional employees to the R&D team.
 
Research and Development
 
Our R&D organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies, features, products, and integrations of our component parts. Research and development employees are located primarily in our principal corporate office on Omer, Israel. We currently have approximately 14 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities.
Regulation
 
Our approach to regulation is generally determined based on a given project. In our engagements with customers operating in the biomedical sector, we comply with the medical device standards in that corresponding territory, such as the FDA or International Organization for Standardization (ISO), among others. Compliance with these regulations is achieved through our QA department and the support we receive from highly experienced quality assurance and regulatory affairs consultants. In addition, we are being audited annually by MEDCERT GmbH, a German Notified Body.
 
For instance, ISO 13485:2016 is a regulatory benchmark that we comply with while working on our medical device projects. ISO 13845:2016 is similar to ISO 9001 in terms of its quality management system (QMS) requirements, however, ISO 13485:2016 is generally considered more rigorous and comprehensive.

Given that we do not manufacture or distribute end-user products to the medical sector, and instead service businesses pursuant to a B2B model, we are subject to far fewer regulatory standards commonly associated with medical device manufacturers or distributors. We develop and manufacture components for other companies, and therefore our involvement in the regulatory submission demands comparatively less responsibility This notwithstanding, we are careful to communicate with the business customer in order to identify certain regulatory dimensions inherent to the project, to which we should pay additional attention. For example, when a component of ours is integrated into a business’s end-user product, such as for the purpose of touching human tissue, we develop and manufacture our parts and components while taking into account certain applicable regulatory standards. These standards might include, inter alia, relevant FDA regulations (e.g. CFR 21 part 820, the medical device reporting requirements (MDR), among others) as well as ISO regulations (e.g. ISO 14644-1, specifically in connection with cleanrooms and associated controlled environments, among other items, or ISO 10993, in connection with the biological evaluation of medical devices). Furthermore, we prioritize our team’s compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directives (RoHS) and REACH (EC 1907/2006).
 
Similarly, if a component part of ours is incorporated into an electronic device for the purpose of being used inside a human body, we ensure compliance with certain FDA requirements as well as IEC 60601 for safety and Electrostatic discharge, including the heating of parts at more than 42 degrees Celsius, as well as a variety of additional technical standards designed for the safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment. Moreover, we perform risk management assessments in accordance with EN ISO 14971:2019 and ISO/TR 24971:2020.
 
In certain instances, our customers prefer that we conduct the testing of its products in internationally certified labs in order to further guarantee our component parts satisfy the applicable regulatory standards. In this scenario, we perform the required tests as a service to the customer and provide the customer with the official test results, specifically in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017, which the customer can later use in order to apply for the required marketing clearance of its end-user product.
 
Since we are targeting to sell our products to customers in the aviation sector, we are in the process of implementing the AS9100D Standard to comply with aerospace industry requirements. Once achieved, this standard will allow us to operate with an aerospace compatible quality management system.
 
Israeli Government Programs
 
As a result of certain agreements between Medigus and ScoutCam Ltd. (for additional information about these agreements refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below) the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA, approved a transfer of IIA know-how developed by Medigus in the framework of the Bio Medical Photonic Consortium, or the Medigus Consortium, to ScoutCam Ltd.
 
Accordingly, all rights and obligations with regard to the IIA under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law, 5744-1984, or the Innovation Law, in connection with such know-how now apply to ScoutCam Ltd.
 
The following are details regarding the rights and obligations within the framework of ScoutCam Ltd.’s activity in the Medigus Consortium, which continue to apply to ScoutCam Ltd. notwithstanding the termination of the Medigus Consortium:
 

(i) | The property rights to information which has been developed belongs to the Medigus Consortium member that developed it. However, the developing entity is obligated to provide the other members in the Medigus Consortium a license for the use of the new information, without consideration, provided that the other members do not transfer such information to any entity which is not a member of the Medigus Consortium. The provision of a license or of the right to use the new information to a third party is subject to approval by the administration of the MAGNET Program at the IIA; 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Medigus Consortium member is entitled to register a patent for the new information which has been developed by it within the framework of its activity in the Medigus Consortium. The foregoing registration does not require approval from the administration of the MAGNET Program at the IIA; and 
(iii) | The know-how and technology developed under the program is subject to the restrictions set forth under the Innovation Law, including restrictions on the transfer of such know-how and any manufacturing rights with respect thereto, without first obtaining the approval of the IIA. Such approval may entail additional payments to the IIA, as determined under the Innovation Law and regulations.

Obligations relevant to us under the Innovation Law include the following:
 

● | Local Manufacturing Obligation. The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law require that we manufacture the products developed with these grants in Israel. Under the regulations promulgated under the Innovation Law, the products may be manufactured outside Israel by us or by another entity only if prior approval is received from the IIA (such approval is not required for the transfer of less than 10% of the manufacturing capacity in the aggregate, in which case a notice should be provided to the IIA). In general, due to manufacturing outside Israel, with respect to royalties bearing grants we would be required to pay royalties at an increased rate, usually 1% in addition to the standard rate and increased royalties cap (between 120% and 300% of the grants, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside Israel). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Know-How Transfer Limitation. The Innovation Law restricts the ability to transfer, in any manner, know-how funded directly or indirectly by the IIA (sale of products is not prohibited), unless the IIA approves doing so and subject to the terms of the Innovation Law and of the IIA’s approval. Among other things, transfer of IIA funded know-how outside of Israel requires prior approval of IIA and in certain circumstances is subject to certain payments to the IIA, calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law. If we wish to transfer IIA funded know-how outside of Israel, the terms for approval will be determined according to the character of the transaction and the consideration paid to us for such transfer. The IIA approval to transfer know-how created, in whole or in part, in connection with a IIA-funded project to third party outside Israel where the transferring company remains an operating Israeli entity is subject to payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law that is based, in general, on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants to the company’s aggregate investments in the project that was funded by these IIA grants, multiplied by the transaction consideration, considering statutory depreciation and less royalties already paid to the IIA. The transfer of such know-how to a party outside Israel where the transferring company ceases to exist as an Israeli entity is subject to a redemption fee formula that is based, in general, on the ratio between aggregate IIA grants received by the company and the company’s aggregate research and development expenses, multiplied by the transaction consideration considering statutory depreciation and less royalties already paid to the IIA. The regulations promulgated under the Innovation Law establish a maximum payment of the redemption fee paid to the IIA under the above mentioned formulas and differentiates between two situations: (i) in the event that the company transfers its IIA funded know-how, in whole or in part, or is sold as part of an M&A transaction, and subsequently ceases to conduct business in Israel, the maximum redemption fee under the above mentioned formulas will be no more than six times the amount received (plus annual interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred, or the entire amount received from the IIA, as applicable; (ii) in the event that following the transactions described above (e.g. asset sale of IIA funded know-how or transfer as part of an M&A transaction) the company continues to conduct its research and development activity in Israel (for at least three years following such transfer and maintain staff of at least 75% of the number of research and development employees it had for the six months before the know-how was transferred and keeps the same scope of employment for such research and development staff), then the company is eligible for a reduced cap of the redemption fee of no more than three times the amounts received (plus annual interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred. In addition, special rules and payment formulas apply for certain kinds of transfers of know-how outside of Israel, such as R&D licenses. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel not according to the R&D Law may give rise to financial exposure as well as criminal liability. 
● | Approval of the transfer of IIA funded technology to another Israeli company may be granted only if the recipient assumes and abides by the provisions of the Innovation Law and related regulations, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and manufacturing rights outside of Israel (in addition, there will be an obligation to pay royalties to the IIA from the income of such sale transaction as part of the royalty payment obligation). 
● | Approval to manufacture products outside of Israel or consent to the transfer of technology, if requested, might not be granted. Furthermore, the IIA may impose certain conditions on any arrangement under which it permits ScoutCam Ltd. to transfer technology or development out of Israel.
