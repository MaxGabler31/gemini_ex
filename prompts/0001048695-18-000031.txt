General
F5 Networks is a leader in multi-cloud application services. Our software and hardware solutions enable every application, anywhere to go faster, smarter, and safer. We serve mid-to-large enterprise, public sector, and service provider customers around the globe.
Our core technology includes a full-proxy, programmable, massively-scalable software platform called TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System). The core features and functions of TMOS enable our products to inspect and modify the content of IP traffic flows at network speeds to deliver a range of application services. Our programmable interface, called iRules, allows customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect, manage and modify traffic. 
Introduced in 2004, the TMOS platform supports the industry’s broadest array of application services, including local and global traffic management, network and application security, access management, encrypted traffic inspection, web fraud prevention, firewalling, web acceleration, and numerous other network and application services. These services are available as software modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance, scalable, purpose-built BIG-IP appliances and chassis-based VIPRION systems; or as software-only Virtual Editions that run in public and private

clouds. Our Silverline managed service offerings allow customers to subscribe to online denial-of-service protection and web application firewall services. Our BIG-IQ centralized management offering gives customers the flexibility to create a secure hybrid infrastructure with consistent policies and centralized management across multiple cloud platforms as well as traditional data centers.
Since the introduction of TMOS, we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology. In 2003, for example, we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uRoam, Inc. and its FirePass SSL VPN technology that has become an important element of our Access Policy Manager (APM) offering. The following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of MagniFire Websystems, Inc. and its TrafficShield security appliance, which became the foundation of our Application Security Manager (ASM) and Advanced WAF products. In 2013, we introduced Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM), enabling enhanced network firewall capabilities. In 2013, we also continued to expand our security offerings with the acquisition of Versafe, a provider of web anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions that has become the basis for our Web Fraud Protection solutions, and in 2014 we acquired Defense.Net, a cloud-based DDoS protection service that complements our on-premises DDoS solution and is currently available on our Silverline SaaS platform.
The majority of our revenue today is derived from sales of BIG-IP and VIPRION products, as well as associated professional services. Our BIG-IP family of products are available as packaged software, appliances, and on our scalable VIPRION systems. 
Our hardware-based products are purpose-built devices integrating industry-standard components, such as Intel-based general-purpose processors, high performance cryptographic offload components, and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays). The architecture of these systems is designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading repetitive, compute-intensive functions such as encryption and compression to specific components, and enabling complex application-layer processing at network speed. Deployed throughout the IT infrastructure, our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable customers to consolidate multiple application services. This consolidation reduces their total cost of ownership and helps drive down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications.
Our software-only offerings provide the same application services available on our purpose-built hardware but are available for use in traditional, private cloud, and public cloud environments. Our Virtual Edition (VE) offerings run on all standard hypervisors, are portable across major cloud environments, deliver faster throughput than competing products, and offer the broadest array of integrated application services available. VEs give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed, spin them up and down with each instance of an application, and move them easily between traditional data centers and multiple private or public cloud platforms - while also incorporating technologies such as microservices and container environments. 
Whether they are deployed as VEs or on purpose-built hardware, our application services can be centrally managed from our BIG-IQ management platform.
We also offer cloud-based, fully managed security services through F5's Silverline offerings. The Silverline brand provides customers proven security technologies coupled with world-class security professionals who manage these offerings from F5's security operations center (SOC). Current primary services include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection and web application firewall (WAF) services.
In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of professional services including consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other technical support services.

Industry Context
Growth and Evolution of Applications
Today, as more and more businesses go digital, increasingly the value of the modern enterprise resides in its applications and its data. In all, applications make up the digital DNA of an enterprise, enabling new customer experiences, increased revenue opportunities, and scaled operations. In fact, research shows that there are over 250 million enterprise application workloads alive in the world today, growing to approximately 1.7 billion over the next few years. Applications have become a primary vehicle through which businesses develop and deliver their goods and services, whether physical or digital in nature.
Emergence of the Dynamic Data Center and Multi-Cloud Infrastructures
From a broad perspective, the goal of IT organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them, regardless of where those applications exist. F5 helps organizations accomplish this goal with software-based application services that support varied and evolving deployment models.
Dynamic Data Center. Server virtualization has enabled organizations to group or partition data center compute resources to meet user demand dynamically and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes. More recently, software-defined networking (SDN) offers organizations a means to reduce costs, increase flexibility, and simplify deployment and management of IT infrastructure through network virtualization. F5 products play key roles in application delivery and security in both environments.
Multi-Cloud Environments. Many organizations are taking advantage of the growing availability of private and public cloud resources as a flexible, secure, and reliable alternative to owning and managing static infrastructure components directly. F5 State of Application Delivery (SOAD) and other studies show that customers are increasingly moving towards multi-cloud architectures where applications on-premises must coexist and collaborate with applications in the cloud and across multiple clouds. F5 solutions can simplify the deployment, delivery, security, and management of applications in such environments.
These changes in the data center and multi-cloud environments have created new challenges for the security of networks, data, and applications. With increasing frequency, sophisticated attackers have sought to compromise applications, particularly in highly distributed environments. Moreover, advanced denial-of-service attacks have exposed major vulnerabilities in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming devices and effectively shutting down the networks. In addition, many network-level security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols that applications depend on to transmit data. Intrusion detection and prevention devices, which rely on signature databases of known threats, afford some protection against these types of attacks. However, they offer limited protection against many of the most common threats, including information leakage, content spoofing, cross-site request forgery, or “zero-day” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities.
In addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt, destroy, or block access to network applications, organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data. The proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones, tablets, and laptops the ability to access corporate materials from virtually anywhere via private and public cloud resources, as well as traditional data centers. This, in turn, has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are only able to access applications and data for which they are authorized, and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users.
Application Services
"Application Services" are network and security services - sometimes referred to as Layer 4-7 services or even application delivery services. There is a large and growing variety of these services available today, covering availability, performance, security, identity, and access management, to name a few. 
In our view, application services emerged from the disaggregation of capabilities that formerly were integrated into devices such as Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) but are now software-defined, loosely coupled, and easily consumed. In essence, making it easier to attach an individual service to an application based on a specific need at a specific point in time.
The benefit of robust application services is that they enable IT to enforce consistent service quality across the entire application portfolio. This “consistent service quality” means that there is an additional layer of security, availability, and reliability that is enforced independently of whether the applications have such capabilities built-in or not. It is critical in a time where much of the user experience is digital in nature, delivered via the cloud, and increasingly built by teams of developers outside of the IT organization. 
When made a core part of an enterprise-wide infrastructure, an application services provider like F5 can provide a level of assurance to the business that its application portfolio remains available, reliable, and secure.

The Need to Optimize the Secure Delivery of Applications and Data
With the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of IT infrastructures, there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over IP networks. IP-based traffic passing between end-user devices, servers, and cloud resources is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled. The basic disassembly, routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require limited intelligence. By contrast, managing, inspecting, modifying, redirecting, and securing application traffic going to and from servers can require highly intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions. Broadly speaking, all of those functions are aspects of application delivery.
Application delivery services dynamically manage, secure, and optimize the flow of traffic between users and servers (physical or virtual), and cloud environments, freeing up other resources by offloading common network functions, such as encryption, IPv4/IPv6 translation, compression, authentication, rate-shaping, and a variety of specialized functions, including network and application security services, policy management, and WAN optimization, that would otherwise have to be coded into applications. Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of applications, it isn't practical to replicate these functions within each instance of an application and maintain consistent policies across a broad spectrum of different applications. In traditional data centers, it has been common practice to deploy an array of point products in front of server farms to provide various services, but that typically requires integrating, maintaining, and upgrading disparate technologies from different vendors, a process that is time-consuming and expensive in terms of both capital and operating costs. From a security standpoint, it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices. In such environments, a more practical and efficient solution is a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single, high-performance device. In virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority, software designed to run on standard hypervisors provides the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardware-based solutions.
Although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider IT infrastructures, service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones, tablets, wearables, and other mobile devices. To cope with these challenges, many service providers have been migrating legacy 2G/3G infrastructures to 4G/5G/LTE networks and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) data centers that require an array of network and application services. Today, most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors, and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices. Increasingly, they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed. To cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4G/5G/LTE networks, the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure, and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data, service providers have also adopted the Diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers.
F5’s Strategy: Multi-Cloud Application Services
At F5, our mission is based on the fact that businesses depend on apps. Whether it’s apps that help connect businesses to their customers or apps that help employees do their jobs, we make sure apps are always available and secure, anywhere. The world’s largest enterprises, service providers, financial and educational institutions, government entities, and consumer brands rely on F5 to stay ahead of security, cloud, and mobility trends. 
Protect your applications 
Apps are the gateway to your data, and most breaches happen at the app level. Protecting your data and your business requires thinking about app security first with integrated solutions to defend critical areas of risk. 
In any environment 
Wherever you deploy your apps - on-premises or in private, public, or multi-cloud environments - our enterprise grade app services will follow. These performance and security services include load balancing, DNS services, web application firewall (WAF), identity and access federation, and DDoS mitigation, among others. 
With flexible models
To keep pace with innovation, many customers need greater budget flexibility. F5 can provide enterprise-grade app services via hardware or software, with flexible licensing and subscription models such as perpetual licenses, annual licenses, or pay-as-you-go options. We also provide application security capabilities as-a-service if you need on-demand application protection. 
Our goal is to lead the industry in providing application services that ensure the safe, fast, and reliable delivery of applications to any user, anywhere, anytime - regardless of a user's location or where the application resides. These services

include availability, security, and performance. They also include managing and orchestrating resources, as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers, networks, and cloud-based resources. Our products are designed to provide strategic points of control throughout the IT infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged. Key components of our strategy include:
Expanding our addressable market with comprehensive application services.
Since the introduction of TMOS, we have developed a suite of BIG-IP software modules, such as Local Traffic Manager (LTM), BIG-IP DNS, Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM), Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT), Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM), Application Security Manager (ASM), Access Policy Manager (APM), and our web-fraud protection capabilities, WebSafe and MobileSafe. All of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our BIG-IP and VIPRION hardware and as Virtual Editions that run on standard hypervisors. 
In 2018, we introduced a portfolio of stand-alone offerings directly meant for security users, including Advanced Web Application Firewall (Advanced WAF), DDoS Hybrid Defender, SSL Orchestrator, and Access Manager. In addition, we offer DDoS protection and web application protection as subscription-based managed services on our cloud-based Silverline SaaS platform. Regardless whether these services are deployed as software-only solutions or as modules running on our purpose-built hardware, our BIG-IQ management platform allows customers to apply and update consistent policies across their F5 services from a centralized resource. 
F5's multi-faceted approach addresses the needs of today's evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings. Moreover, in step with our product development efforts and acquisition strategies concerning related or adjacent technologies, we believe our current addressable market is significantly broader and more diverse than the ADC market as industry analysts have defined it. 
Investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs.
We meet with our customers often and maintain multiple customer advisory relationships to ensure that our development efforts are aligned with their needs. We continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our TMOS platform as well as new technologies to deliver new features and functions that address the complex, changing needs of our customers. Although the bulk of our investment is software development, concurrent development of tightly integrated hardware that delivers consistent, guaranteed high-performance continues to be an appreciable element of our investment strategy. We also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets.
Continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners.
F5 works with many of the world’s leading technology companies to improve manageability, strengthen security, and ensure faster and more successful deployments. Joint customers benefit from the integration and interoperability that result from this close collaboration.
In recent years, we have developed partnerships with Cisco, HP, Microsoft, and VMware to provide integrated application services for their offerings. In addition, we have advanced partnership efforts around Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VMware vCloud, Cisco ACI, and many other technologies to provide cloud-based application services and solutions for customers. We plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders and emerging players.
Leveraging DevCentral, our online community of network architects and developers.
Customization of our products' capabilities via iRules, iRules LX, and related technologies enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. Our online community, DevCentral, lets customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use F5's programmable technologies to solve problems and enhance the security, performance, and availability of applications. A corollary benefit is that a number of the solutions posted by DevCentral participants have become standard features in newer releases of TMOS. DevCentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that helps guide product development efforts.
F5 Solutions
F5 offers the industry’s most comprehensive set of application services for enterprises, governments, and service providers around the globe. These solutions may be deployed on-premises, in a private cloud (which could be hosted by a hosting provider), in a public cloud, or in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment.
7

Our integrated application services are available via software modules on our purpose-built hardware, as software-only Virtual Editions (VEs) that run on standard hypervisors, and as cloud-based solutions. These products function as strategic points of control in IP networks, inspecting, modifying, and directing traffic to optimize the security, availability, and delivery of applications and data to any user, anywhere, anytime, and on any device. Our service provider solutions address the complex needs of service providers and complement our TMOS-based products by enabling fast, reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packet-based 4G/LTE networks and network functions virtualization (NFV) environments. We believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their IP networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs, enhance productivity, and improve service to employees, customers, and partners.
Since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of Application Delivery Networking as it has been traditionally defined. Today, we also offer solutions that include application security, secure remote access, enhanced firewall capabilities, optimization, access policy management, carrier-grade network address translation, Diameter signaling, policy enforcement, fraud detection and more, opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets.
Operating System and Service Module Software
The core of our primary application delivery technology is TMOS, our Traffic Management Operating System, introduced in September 2004. The full-proxy characteristics of the TMOS architecture enable our products to intercept, inspect, and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of IP-enabled application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure, optimize, and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on.
Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS)
Since TMOS was launched, we have added thousands of new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic passing between users and applications. TMOS includes several features and functions that are unique to our products, with examples such as those listed below:

• | Programmability and customization of F5 products for applications (iApps), for control and management (iControl), for the data plane (iRules and iRules LX), and for threshold breaches and alerts (iCall). See more details below in the DevOps, Programmability, and APIs sub-section.


• | ScaleN is a set of three unique capabilities that enhance the flexibility of our products:


◦ | Clustered Multiprocessing (CMP) allows customers to cluster and aggregate processors (cores) within BIG-IP appliances or VIPRION chassis products.


◦ | Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing (vCMP) enables the creation of separate virtual instances of TMOS within an appliance or chassis, each with a different configuration and assigned to a different application.


◦ | Device Service Clustering (DSC) gives customers the ability to group devices and services across an array of physical and virtual devices (BIG-IP appliances, VIPRION chassis, or Virtual Editions). Devices can be added to or removed from a DSC without disrupting application services, and application services can be independently managed within the cluster.

TMOS includes features that enhance the ability of our products to protect and hide networks and applications from denial-of-service attacks and other types of security threats. Other enhancements include gateway support for software-defined networks (SDN), symmetrical and asymmetrical application acceleration, subscriber and application aware enforcement for service providers, management and orchestration of multiple devices, and improved visibility that allows customers to monitor and record the performance of applications and users. The most recent versions of TMOS deliver leading application services with enhanced public cloud integration and more sophisticated security policies for on-premises and hybrid cloud environments. Enhancements in iRules LX enable programmability across traditional, cloud, and hybrid architectures and leverage an extensive Node.js library that allows DevOps teams to create customized services quickly and easily.
Software Modules
The features and functions embedded in F5 products provide integrated software services that cover a broad range of application-aware network functions from load balancing to security. These services are available as software modules designed to run on our purpose-built hardware, as software-only Virtual Editions with any standard hypervisor, and in a variety of cloud-based environments. Example offerings in the BIG-IP product line include:
8


• | Local Traffic Manager (LTM) provides intelligent load balancing, traffic management, and application health checking.


• | BIG-IP DNS improves the performance and availability of global applications by intelligently directing users to the closest or best-performing physical, virtual, or cloud environment. In addition, it enhances DNS security by automatically scaling to absorb a rapid increase in queries resulting from a denial-of-service attack and mitigates complex threats from malware and viruses by blocking access to malicious IP domains.


• | Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM) enables high-performance network firewall capabilities designed to ensure that traffic is not interrupted even under the most intense attacks. AFM scales to support millions of concurrent connections per second and uses the flexibility of iRules, sophisticated filtering, immediate blacklisting, and over a hundred built-in threat vectors to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks. We also offer a carrier-class version of AFM designed to meet the rigorous requirements of an S/Gi firewall in service provider networks.


• | Application Security Manager (ASM) and Advanced WAF are web application firewall products that provide comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized and targeted attacks. Combining a positive security model (“deny all unless allowed”) with signature-based detection, ASM can prevent “zero-day” attacks in addition to known security threats. Advanced WAF additionally provides malicious bot protection, application-layer encryption, API inspection, and behavior analytics to help defend against more sophisticated application attacks.


• | Access Policy Manager (APM) and Access Manager provide secure, granular, context-aware access to networks and applications while simplifying authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management. They include an endpoint security service that validates client devices, including personal devices used by employees to access corporate applications and data, to protect organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental data loss, and rogue device access. This allows users to apply repeatable access policies across many devices, networks, applications, and servers with centralized visibility of their authorization infrastructure. Access Manager additionally provides API authorization and man-in-the-middle attack prevention with real-time login credential encryption.


• | SSL Orchestrator provides high-performance decryption of inbound and outbound SSL/TLS traffic, enabling security inspection to expose threats and stop attacks. Dynamic service chaining and policy-based traffic steering allow organizations to intelligently manage encrypted traffic flows across the entire security chain with optimal availability. SSL Orchestrator ensures encrypted traffic can be decrypted, inspected by security controls, then re-encrypted, delivering enhanced visibility to mitigate threats traversing the network. As a result, organizations maximize their security services investment for malware, data loss prevention (DLP), ransomware, and next-generation firewalls (NGFW), thereby preventing inbound and outbound threats, including exploitation, callback, and data exfiltration.

Software modules can be licensed individually or as part of an integrated system. In addition, our “Better” and “Best” offerings bundle certain modules and are sold at a discount to the price customers would pay if each of the included items were purchased separately. 
Cloud-Based Subscription Services

• | Silverline is a SaaS platform that allows customers to subscribe to security services running on our own high-performance, massively-scalable hardware in cloud-based points of presence around the globe. Two services are currently available on Silverline: Denial of Service (DoS) protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF). Depending on the level of protection they require, customers can route traffic through Silverline 24/7 or only when an attack is detected. For customers who want to minimize the upfront costs and expense of maintaining on-premises solutions, these services are simple to deploy and an affordable alternative. For large enterprises, subscribing to these services in conjunction with F5's on-premises DDoS Hybrid Defender and Advanced WAF can provide a first line of defense against attacks before they have a significant down-time impact on their application or network services.

Service Provider Solutions
In addition to the solutions described above, F5 also offers a number of technologies specifically aimed at the service provider market, including:

• | The GiLAN Solution


◦ | GiLAN solution is made up of BIG-IP LTM and DNS, Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) and Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM). The modules have been described above in this document.


◦ | Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) offers a broad set of tools that enables service providers to successfully migrate to IPv6 while continuing to support and interoperate with existing IPv4 devices and content. BIG-IP CGNAT offers service providers tunneling solutions with Dual-Stack Lite capabilities as well as native network address translation solutions such as NAT44 and NAT64. It provides carrier-grade scalability by offering a

9

very high number of IP address translations, very fast NAT translation setup rates, high throughput, and high-speed logging.

◦ | Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM) offers service providers a comprehensive set of traffic classification capabilities to accurately identify the specific applications and services subscribers are using and how they’re using them. This information allows them to steer application and subscriber traffic to the most appropriate value-added services (such as web caching, video optimization, or parental control) and reduce the burden on other services. PEM also provides deep reporting, enabling service providers to build tailored services and packages based on subscribers’ application usage and traffic classification.


• | Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)

All software modules BIG-IP LTM, AFM, PEM, CGNAT, DNS, and others are available as Virtual Editions which make up Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). F5 offers NFV solutions as pre-packaged and orchestrated network functions (e.g., GiLAN, GiFW) as well as individual module licenses and “VNF Better” and “VNF Best” offering bundles that customers can use to build their own VNFs. Pre-packaged, ETSI NFV model-aligned NFV solutions provide significant simplification for customers that are moving and scaling NFV architecture. Network functions can be pre-configured, deployed, and lifecycle-managed by VNF Manager and scaled automatically to reach desired (purchased) capacity. Also, automation capabilities built into pre-packaged NFV solutions will enable faster transition to 5G services. 
Our pre-packaged NFV solutions can be plugged into overall orchestrators via VNF Manager. VNFs built from individual VE instances can be orchestrated with the service provider’s orchestration engines through open APIs and integrated with external SDN controllers.
We also offer a variety of licensing options, including subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and Enterprise Licensing Agreements (ELAs).

• | Carrier Class Firewall (CCFW)

F5’s carrier-class network firewall provides end-to-end security. From customer billing and provisioning systems to protecting LTE network infrastructure and strengthening mobile device security including protection against DDoS attacks. Our multilayered, redundant security platform supports new 4G-LTE, 5G, and VoLTE technologies and easily integrates with today’s NFV environments. Defending assets at scale, without impairing performance is the security approach that earns us the trust of all ten of the top Tier-1 operators.

• | Signaling Traffic Management

Service Provider networks use several key protocols like the Diameter signaling protocol which is a de facto standard adopted by service providers to deal with the massive increase in signaling traffic that accompanies the mobile industry’s transition to 4G/5G/LTE networks. F5’s BIG-IP platform supports traffic management and security of traffic associated with protocols like Diameter, SIP, GTP, and also IoT protocols like MQTT that are widely used in service provider networks. Diameter, SIP, and other Load Balancers deliver cost-effective connectivity, scalability, and control to service providers migrating from legacy infrastructures to LTE and IMS networks.

• | 5G

With a growing adoption of the 5G wireless standard, the majority of service providers are experiencing a significant increase in capacity requirements and automation needs to deal with distributed and virtualized environments. While all F5 Service Provider solutions mentioned support current 5G deployments, pre-packaged NFV solutions are built to provide automation and enable carriers’ easy transition to 5G. In addition, as the 5G standard evolves, we will continue expanding our set of 5G-specific solutions like IoT Firewall, GTP Firewall, Network Slicing solutions, etc.
Hardware Platforms
All of our purpose-built hardware products are designed to enhance the performance of our software by leveraging a combination of custom FPGA logic and off-the-shelf silicon, providing a balance of cost and flexibility. Currently, we offer two types of hardware configurations: BIG-IP appliances; and our chassis-based VIPRION products. Both BIG-IP and VIPRION run TMOS and support our product software modules. We also sell specialty appliances that integrate specific software services and are only available as standalone products.
Datasheets for all of our hardware platforms are available in the products section of our website.
BIG-IP Appliances
10

Platforms in our family of BIG-IP appliances differ primarily in their performance and size characteristics resulting from the hardware components and configurations that make up these systems. Currently, BIG-IP appliances are available in two product lines: a standard series and the newer, cloud-ready iSeries (introduced in the second half of calendar year 2016). Enhancements in performance, scalability, and hardware programmability enable F5 products to run various software services, including F5's hypervisor technology called virtual clustered multiprocessing (vCMP), which allows complete segmentation of BIG-IP systems into independent virtual BIG-IPs.
VIPRION Chassis-Based Systems
Currently, we offer four chassis-based systems: VIPRION 4800, VIPRION 4480, VIPRION 2400, and VIPRION 2200. VIPRION’s unique CMP architecture distributes traffic evenly across all available processors and allows customers to add or remove blades without disrupting traffic. It also helps customers simplify their networks by consolidating application delivery services with vCMP, saving management costs as well as power, space, and cooling in the data center. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we introduced the VIPRION 4450 blade for VIPRION 4800 (8-blade chassis) and VIPRION 4480 (4-blade chassis). Each blade delivers greater than 100Gb of throughput, and a fully loaded VIPRION 4800 can support more than one billion concurrent connections.
Software Platforms
BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE)
Virtual Edition (VE) is F5’s software ADC and Security services platform. VE was introduced in 2011 to enable customers to leverage F5’s services in virtualized and cloud-based environments. Currently, VE is deployable on most hypervisors including VMware ESXi, KVM, Xen, and Microsoft Hyper-V, as well as in various cloud environments such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and OpenStack. VE is optimized for performance and interoperability, including a high-performance version supporting up to 40G throughput and integration into automation/orchestration frameworks (Ansible, Puppet, Terraform, OpenShift, and Cloud Foundry). F5 also provides tools and supported cloud templates based on a robust set of APIs in our GitHub repository to simplify and automate provisioning and configuration of our services. The same breadth of BIG-IP software modules can be deployed on VE, providing customers the ability to deliver consistent services and security policies for their applications and gain operational agility when deploying in multiple cloud environments. VE is offered in a variety of licensing options including as a subscription license, as part of an enterprise licensee agreement, as a perpetual license, and in a utility model through several F5 cloud partners. VE is the core platform for addressing the adoption of NFV, Cloud, and DevOps by Enterprise IT and Service Provider networks.

F5 Automation Toolchain
The F5 Automation Toolchain provides a set of composable elements that deliver declarative, intent-based APIs for the F5 platform. These APIs are backed by strong API Contracts that enable forward and backwards compatibility, rapid iteration and release. Toolchain components are designed to provide:

• | A powerful abstraction layer for complex Application Services

11


• | Integration with F5 and third-party Automation, Orchestration, and Management solutions and frameworks


• | Capabilities that enable the Infrastructure-as-Code and Configuration-as-Code methodologies preferred by DevOps enabled customers

Components are available as installable packages that run on the TMOS platform or as containerized instances that can run independently in common Container and Virtualization platforms such as Kubernetes and VMware. The components enable agile, DevOps-centric Application Service Lifecycle management, allowing customers to automate and orchestrate:

• | Lifecycle of F5 devices and virtual instances (Declarative Onboarding Extension)


• | Lifecycle of complex Layer 4-7 Application Services (Application Services 3 Extension)


• | Offload of telemetry data for devices, instances and deployed Application Services (Telemetry Streaming Extension)


• | Integration with third-party systems and solutions through declarative APIs backed by strong API Contracts

DevOps, Programmability, and APIs
F5’s DevOps, Programmability, and API portfolio enables automation, orchestration, and partner integration capabilities across F5’s product lines. 
iControl REST is our platform API, built on REST (Representational State Transfer), which is a simple, stateless architecture delivered over HTTP(S). It uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is rapidly becoming the most commonly used format for transferring data pairs. Combined with the fact that iControl REST is effectively an extension of tmsh (our command line interface), it provides a low overhead solution, both in terms of operational expense, as well as time to learn. iControl LX allows for out-of-band customizations to the control plane just as iRules and iRules LX do for the data plane. It provides the foundation for F5’s programmable extensibility layer, enabling users to extend and create fundamentally new platform capabilities. It enables users to run Node.js “extensions” on BIG-IP which enable custom behaviors at new iControl REST API endpoints. These extensions can be initiated and controlled by calling their new REST API endpoints.
iApps is a set of portable, customizable, reusable templates that enable the rapid and predictable deployment of our products in front of dozens of applications from vendors including Cisco, Citrix, Microsoft, Oracle, and VMware. iApps also allows customers and partners to create templates that simplify the deployment and provisioning of their own applications. iApps LX extends iControl LX by enabling a rich presentation layer (GUI) and JSON-based application templates.
iCall is a control plane scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. iCall enables administrators to react to specified data plane events by executing services on the management plane. It can also be used periodically to manage backups or repopulate DNS, or to provide regularly scheduled services such as configuration audits.
iRules is a powerful, built-in data plane scripting language that enables users to customize how our products intercept, inspect, transform, and direct inbound or outbound application traffic. iRules LX enables programmability across traditional, cloud, and hybrid architectures and leverages an extensive Node.js library that allows DevOps teams to create customized services quickly and easily.
Third-party orchestration systems such as Ansible, Terraform, Chef, and Puppet are critical for the DevOps community/application owners. F5 is primarily investing in Ansible and Python SDK module delivery to enable simplified and declarative BIG-IP onboarding and configuration.
Additional programmability characteristics include the following:

• | iRules LX Streaming support


• | High-performance Node.js-native data plane programmability


• | iApps LX framework to enable rich presentation layer for:


• | SSL Orchestrator


• | DDoS Hybrid Defender


• | APM Access Guided Configuration


• | F5 Automation Toolchain Components


• | F5 API Contracts


• | Ensures API forward and backwards compatibility, prevents breaking changes


• | Transparency of endpoint lifecycle state (EA, GA, Internal, Test, Deprecated) to ensure customers use appropriate APIs and plan for upgrades

12


• | iControl LX


• | Enables customers to extend fundamental platform capabilities via custom REST API endpoints


• | Provides the base platform for F5 Automation Toolchain Components

Product Development
We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners. Our product development organization which, along with product management, encompasses our products and technology group (PTG), employs standard processes for the development, documentation, and quality control of software and systems that are designed to meet these goals. These processes include working with our business development and marketing teams, customers, and partners to identify technology innovation opportunities to better meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets.
Over 90 percent of our product development organization is engaged in software development in 8 major locations. The LTM, DNS, core cloud management, and orchestration products and platforms are primarily developed in Seattle, Washington. Development of Security products is centered in Tel Aviv, Israel and San Jose, California with our Web Application Firewall and WebSafe/MobileSafe centered in Tel Aviv, and our core firewall (AFM) and Identity and Access products and technologies developed in San Jose. Policy Enforcement Manager is also developed in San Jose.
Our hardware engineering team is located in Spokane, Washington, San Jose, and Tel Aviv.
Smaller development sites including Boulder, Warsaw, and Lowell also support the core development teams in the larger centers. Additionally, we have recently opened a dedicated facility to continue to scale and extend the development of the entire product line, including Core Platform, Cloud, and Security technologies in Hyderabad, India.
Members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had research and product development expenses of $366.1 million, $350.4 million, and $334.2 million, respectively.
Customers
Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, and healthcare, along with government customers. In fiscal year 2018, sales outside of the Americas represented 44.3% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels, including distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), managed service providers (MSPs) and systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2018 was derived from these channel sales. Our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts.
F5 sales teams. Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale of our products and services to their customers. We reward our partners that identify new business and provide sales expertise for our portfolio of products and solutions through various incentive programs. We also sell our products and services directly to customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are managed by our major account team. Systems engineers, with deep technical domain expertise, support our regional sales account managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale technical solution engineering and support resources as needed.
Distributors, VARs, and MSPs. As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors, VARs, and MSPs. We derive a 
13

majority of our product sales from VARs and MSPs rely on our large distributors for fulfillment, training, and partner enablement.
Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.
For fiscal year 2018, sales to five of our worldwide distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc., Tech Data, Synnex Corporation, Arrow ECS and Westcon Group, Inc. represented 16.6%, 11.6%, 10.8%, 10.7%, and 10.4% of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with these distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant Ingram Micro, Inc., Tech Data, Synnex Corporation, Arrow ECS and Westcon Group, Inc. the right to distribute our products to resellers, with no minimum purchase requirements.
Systems integrators. We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, HP Enterprise Services, and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application deployments or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance.
Resellers and Technology Partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently, we partner with Dell and HP, who resell our products, and with other large technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware and Cisco, who recommend our products to their customers. Management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team, which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with this belief, our marketing organization works directly with customers and partners, as well as F5's distinct business units and product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position.
To support the growing number of developers using our products, we continue to promote and expand DevCentral, F5's online community site that provides technical resources to customers, prospects, and partners wanting to extend and optimize their use of our solutions. A key aspect of DevCentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with iRules and iCall. At the end of fiscal year 2018, DevCentral had more than 350,000 registered members. In fiscal year 2019, we will further expand our developer marketing efforts to include participation in third party ‘appdev’ and ‘devops’ communities.
We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products. These include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products, business relationships, and technology partnerships. In addition, we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising, digital outreach, and social media efforts.
More recently, F5 established a dedicated team of seasoned security researchers called F5 Labs. F5 Labs combines the threat intelligence data we collect with the expertise of our security researchers to provide actionable, global intelligence around current cyber threats and identify future trends. The teams investigate everything from threat actors and the nature and source of attacks to post-attack analysis of significant incidents in order to create a comprehensive view of the threat landscape. From the newest malware variants to zero-day exploits and attack trends, F5 Labs provides the latest insights from our threat intelligence team.
Backlog
At the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we had product backlog of approximately $30.5 million and $25.6 million, respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers, or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer 
14

prior to shipment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.
Customer Service and Technical Support
We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that include installation, phone support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting, and training services.
We provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base.
Prior to the installation of our products, our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions.
Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates, software error correction releases, hardware repair and replacement, and, in the majority of cases, round-the-clock call center support. Free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract. We also offer an online, automated, self-help customer support function called “AskF5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions, allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk. This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent level. We also offer an online service called iHealth, which allows customers to diagnose up-to-the-minute snapshots of their BIG-IP systems. Diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects, a description of the issue, recommendations for resolution, and a link to further information within the AskF5 knowledge base.
F5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products, including local and wide area network system administration and management. We also have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers as having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products. To provide our customers with onsite and remote help, we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network management, documentation and performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to a third-party contract manufacturer for building, assembling, and testing according to our specifications.
Our purpose-built systems are manufactured by Flex LTD. Subcontracting activity at Flex encompasses prototype builds, full production, and direct fulfillment. Flex also performs the following activities on our behalf: material procurement, PCB assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, and direct shipment. We provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturer to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity, and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand. Flex procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products, and tests them according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, value-added resellers, or end users. Generally, we do not own the components. Title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturer to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location. If the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.
Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source.
Testing of all sub-assemblies and assembled systems of our products is performed at Flex's facilities in Zhuhai, China and Guadalajara, Mexico. A small number of systems are built up to a non-functional state and shipped to Guadalajara for configuration and final testing. Systems built and fulfilled in Zhuhai are for distribution to APAC and Japan end users. Systems 
15

built in Guadalajara are shipped to the Flex's fulfillment center in Milpitas, California for distribution primarily to EMEA and the Americas.
Competition
The expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities, many of which are outside the bounds of the Application Delivery Networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as Gartner, Dell’Oro, and others. In addition to server load balancing, traffic management, and other functions normally associated with application delivery, our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security, and policy management, where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional ADC vendors. The ability to create customized, programmable services using iRules, iControl, iCall, and similar technologies has also enabled us, our customers, and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no off-the-shelf solution. As a result, we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features, functions, and capabilities of our products, or accurately represent the addressable market for those products.
Within the more narrowly defined traditional ADC market, several companies sell server load balancing products and capabilities. These include Citrix Systems, Inc., Radware Ltd., and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set, such as: A10 Networks, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Array Networks, Inc., Avi Networks, Barracuda Networks, Inc., NGINX, HA Proxy, and Kemp Technologies.
In related markets, we compete with companies such as the following:

• | Cisco, Juniper Networks, and A10 for carrier-grade firewall capabilities;


• | Akamai, Imperva, Citrix, and Barracuda Networks in the web application firewall market;


• | Cisco, Juniper, and A10 in Carrier Grade NAT;


• | Symantec / Blue Coat and A10 in SSL Orchestration;


• | Pulse Security for Access Policy Manager;


• | Procera, Allot, Sandvine, and other DPI vendors with our PEM offering; and


• | Akamai, Arbor, and Radware in DDoS protection.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance, customer support, brand recognition, the scope of distribution and sales channels, and pricing. Certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. However, because of the superior performance, broad functionality, and unique capabilities of our products, which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness, we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. F5 holds 313 patents in the United States and has 23 international patents (with applications pending for various aspects of our technology). Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we had 4,409 full-time employees, including 1,268 in product development, 1,682 in sales and marketing, 891 in professional services and technical support and 475 in accounting and finance, administration and operations. 
16

None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.
