Offshore Resources
 
For our offshore energy clients, we provide environmental risk advisory services, critical issues analyses, and project siting support.  We help clients obtain federal, state, and local permits and conduct agency and tribal consultation.  We develop environmental/biological/marine studies, surveys, and modeling and provide GIS-based data management and mapping services.  We also have teams of public outreach experts that provide stakeholder engagement and community outreach services for clients.  We provide environmental monitoring/ compliance services during construction as well as post-construction.
Pipelines and Liquefied Natural Gas (“LNG”)
 
This market includes onshore pipelines and domestic upstream (exploration and production) oil and gas development and permitting projects, offshore and onshore LNG import and export terminals and associated pipelines, and deep water ports for exporting crude oil.  Our extensive suite of pipeline services includes route selection, evaluation of alternatives, field surveys, regulatory compliance and permit support, preparation of environmental monitoring and restoration plans, and environmental inspection, including development of quality assurance specifications.
 
The rapid development of shale gas resources has advanced the U.S. from having to import natural gas to now producing natural gas in excess of domestic needs. This has transformed the U.S. LNG marketplace from permitting and constructing LNG import terminals to permitting and constructing LNG export terminals.  We have also worked with clients to develop offshore and onshore LNG import and export terminals and associated pipelines.
 
Renewables
 
The renewable market includes solar energy and onshore and offshore wind energy projects. This is a very dynamic market, where increasingly favorable economics of renewables and changing regulations are leading to new regional markets and the frequent emergence of new market entrants.  We have extensive experience providing strategic environmental consulting services to wind energy developers.  We also support solar energy developers during all phases of solar projects and have supported these projects in more than 30 states.  We conduct critical issues analyses, feasibility and siting studies, permitting and due diligence audits, environmental impact assessments, project permitting and construction monitoring and operational compliance.
Electric Transmission
 
This market includes projects associated with underwater and underground transmission lines, urban rebuilds, and renewable generation interconnections in the U.S. and South America.  We prepare feasibility studies, evaluate alternative routes, analyze environmental impacts, and acquire utility certificates, approvals, and permits for electric transmission facilities to bring electric power from its source to regional population centers as well as to upgrade aging infrastructure.
 
Site Assessment and Remediation (“SAR”)
 
Within our SAR market, we provide a variety of services related to environmental liabilities from hazardous waste sites, including due diligence, site assessment, risk assessment, preliminary assessment/site inspection, remedial investigation and feasibility study, corrective/remedial action planning, remedial design, construction oversight, brownfield and property redevelopment, and searches for potentially responsible parties.  We provide services to commercial clients, federal government agencies and various state agencies and municipalities located within the states of New York, Florida, Illinois, South Carolina, and Washington.  Our significant federal SAR clients and services include the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”).

Armed Services
 
Our U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) clients include the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and other branches of the DOD.  We provide real property master planning, military programming, geospatial data and systems support, database management, encroachment planning and water resources planning services at DOD air stations and bases, weapons ranges, and onshore and offshore range complexes in the U.S. and internationally.  We develop technologically advanced military master planning tools by leveraging the latest in GIS and information technology.  We assist DOD installations with incorporating renewable energy and reducing their environmental footprint while sustaining mission requirements and maintaining positive relationships with the surrounding communities.
Federal Lands and Waters
 
Our federal lands and waters work includes planning/NEPA and other non-SAR work for federal clients including the U.S. Forest Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and BLM.
International and Communications
 
Our International and Communications work encompasses international project development for telecommunications and offshore activities such as oil and gas, as well as joint opportunities with our Latin American subsidiaries and ongoing telecommunications work.
Resilient Communities
 
We help clients in building community resilience, emergency management planning, and disaster preparedness and recovery with an emphasis on planning, adaptation, and mitigating impacts of sea level rise and climate change.  We also help organizations and government agencies to become more resilient by assisting them to plan for, respond to, and recover from extreme disruptive events that can result in a wide range of cascading emergencies, with emphasis on building more resilient communities.  Our strength in meeting the challenges of disaster management, mitigation, prevention and recovery lies in the breadth of our multidisciplinary staff and resources and our rapid deployment capability.
Water and Ecosystem Restoration
 
Our Restoration team provides invasive species management, stream and shoreline habitat restoration, bank stabilization, fish passage, and other services to clients and is focused on expanding our 20 years of experience in these areas to new clients and geographies. Funding for water and ecosystem restoration projects flows from Natural Resource Damage Assessment funds, federal programs, local agency contracts, and non-government organization and other grant-funded projects.
Contract Backlog
 
Firm backlog represents an estimate of gross revenue expected to be recognized over the remaining life of projects under contracts that are awarded, funded and in progress.  These projects include work to be performed under contracts which contain termination provisions that may be exercised without penalty at any time by our clients upon written notice to us, in which case the client would only be obligated to pay us for services provided through the termination date.  A significant portion of our revenue is generated through projects awarded under Master Service Agreements with our clients.  In these instances, only the current unfinished projects are included in our backlog.

 Firm backlog by operating segment is summarized in the following table.
 

 | January 31, 2019 | | July 31, 2018 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+--------+---------------+--
 | (in thousands) | 
Total firm backlog of uncompleted contracts: | | | | 
U.S. operations | $ | 51,744 | | $ | 49,081
South American operations | | 14,721 | | | 9,465 
Consolidated totals | $ | 66,465 | | $ | 58,546
Anticipated completion of firm backlog in next twelve months: | | | | | 
U.S. operations | $ | 43,716 | | $ | 42,991
South American operations | | 8,909 | | | 8,325 
Consolidated totals | $ | 52,625 | | $ | 51,316

 
For our U.S. operations, new orders reported as additions to firm backlog kept pace with work delivered on projects during the first six months of fiscal year 2019.   The increase in firm backlog for our South American operations during the same period was the result of significant new orders that outpaced completion of projects.
 
In addition to the firm backlog summarized in the table above, we also have been awarded contracts that are partially or entirely unfunded, but which are expected to be partially or entirely funded during the remaining life of the associated projects.  Total unfunded backlog approximated $24.0 million and $23.0 million at January 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, respectively.  Until these projects are funded, we cannot be certain regarding the value of gross revenue that we will recognize under these contracts.
 
Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of profitability. Our method for calculating backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies.  In addition, we have revised our methodology for calculating backlog from that used for backlog disclosures included in Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC prior to July 31, 2018.
 
Competition
 
We are subject to competition with respect to each of the services that we provide.  No single entity currently dominates the environmental services industry or has the capability to serve the entire market.  Some of our competitors are larger than us, have greater financial and other resources than we do, or may be more specialized in certain disciplines or locations.  Other U.S. competitors have special status as small businesses which allows them to compete for U.S. government contracts set-aside to be awarded exclusively to small business concerns.  We compete primarily on the basis of our reputation, quality of service, expertise, responsiveness and price.
Management Team and Employees
 
Our management and staff are comprised of individuals with advanced degrees representing scientific and engineering disciplines working together in multidisciplinary teams to provide innovative solutions.  The members of our executive management team have extensive experience in the environmental consulting industry.
 
As of July 31, 2018, we had 779 employees (602 full-time) in all of our offices, which included 532 employees (393 full-time) in domestic offices and 247 employees (209 full-time) in foreign offices of consolidated subsidiaries.
 
In March 2019, we initiated specific staff reduction initiatives pursuant to a plan to restructure the Company’s U.S. operations.  Refer to Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional disclosure regarding the Corporate Restructuring Plan and related Staff Reduction Programs.
