ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

General
Johnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global diversified technology and multi industrial leader serving a wide range of customers in more than 150 countries. The Company creates intelligent buildings, efficient energy solutions, integrated infrastructure and next generation transportation systems that work seamlessly together to deliver on the promise of smart cities and communities. The Company is committed to helping our customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through strategic focus on our buildings and energy growth platforms.
Johnson Controls was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1885 as Johnson Electric Service Company to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. The Company was renamed to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 1974. In 1978, the Company acquired Globe-Union, Inc., a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of automotive batteries for both the replacement and original equipment markets. The Company entered the automotive seating industry in 1985 with the acquisition of Michigan-based Hoover Universal, Inc. In 2005, the Company acquired York International, a global supplier of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning ("HVAC") and refrigeration equipment and services. In 2014, the Company acquired Air Distribution Technologies, Inc. ("ADTi"), one of the largest independent providers of air distribution and ventilation products in North America. On October 1, 2015, the Company formed a joint venture with Hitachi to expand its building related product offerings.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Johnson Controls, Inc. ("JCI Inc.") and Tyco completed their combination with JCI Inc. merging with a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Tyco (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, Tyco changed its name to “Johnson Controls International plc” and JCI Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson Controls International plc. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, "Business Combinations." JCI Inc. was the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the historical consolidated financial statements of JCI Inc. for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be

the historic financial statements of the Company. Refer to Note 2, "Merger Transaction," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
The acquisition of Tyco brings together best-in-class product, technology and service capabilities across controls, fire, security, HVAC and power solutions, to serve various end-markets including large institutions, commercial buildings, retail, industrial, small business and residential.  The combination of the Tyco and Johnson Controls buildings platforms creates opportunities for near-term growth through cross-selling, complementary branch and channel networks, and expanded global reach for established businesses. The new Company benefits by combining innovation capabilities and pipelines involving new products, advanced solutions for smart buildings and cities, value-added services driven by advanced data and analytics. 
On October 31, 2016, the Company completed the spin-off of its Automotive Experience business by way of the transfer of the Automotive Experience Business from Johnson Controls to Adient plc ("Adient") and the issuance of ordinary shares of Adient directly to holders of Johnson Controls ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. Prior to the open of business on October 31, 2016, each of the Company's shareholders received one ordinary share of Adient plc for every 10 ordinary shares of Johnson Controls held as of the close of business on October 19, 2016, the record date for the distribution. Company shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Adient, if any. Following the separation and distribution, Adient plc is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "ADNT." The Company did not retain any equity interest in Adient plc. Adient's historical financial statements are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation. 
The Building Technologies & Solutions ("Buildings") business is a global market leader in engineering, developing, manufacturing and installing building products and systems around the world, including HVAC equipment, HVAC controls, energy-management systems, security systems, fire detection systems and fire suppression solutions. The Buildings business further serves customers by providing technical services (in the HVAC, security and fire-protection space), energy-management consulting and data-driven solutions via its data-enabled business. Finally, the Company has a strong presence in the North American residential air conditioning and heating systems market and is a global market leader in industrial refrigeration products.
The Power Solutions business is a leading global supplier of lead-acid automotive batteries for virtually every type of passenger car, light truck and utility vehicle. The Company serves both automotive original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and the general vehicle battery aftermarket. The Company also supplies advanced battery technologies to power start-stop, hybrid and electric vehicles.
On November 13, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with BCP Acquisitions LLC (“Purchaser”). The Purchaser is a newly-formed entity controlled by investment funds managed by Brookfield Capital Partners LLC. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions therein, the Company has agreed to sell, and Purchaser has agreed to acquire, the Company’s Power Solutions business for a purchase price of $13.2 billion. Net cash proceeds are expected to be $11.4 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses. The transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions and required regulatory approvals. The operating results of the Power Solutions business will be reported as a discontinued operation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Products/Systems and Services
Building Technologies & Solutions
Building Technologies & Solutions sells its integrated control systems, security systems, fire-detection systems, equipment and services primarily through the Company’s extensive global network of sales and service offices, with operations in approximately 70 countries. Significant sales are also generated through global third-party channels, such as distributors of air-conditioning, security, fire-detection and commercial HVAC systems. The Company’s large base of current customers leads to significant repeat business for the retrofit and replacement markets. In addition, the new commercial construction market is also important. Trusted Buildings brands, such as YORK®, Hitachi Air Conditioning, Metasys®, Ansul, Ruskin®, Titus®, Frick®, PENN®, Sabroe®, Simplex® and Grinnell® give the Company the most diverse portfolio in the building technology industry.
In fiscal 2018, approximately 26% of its sales originated from its service offerings. In fiscal 2018, Building Technologies & Solutions accounted for 75% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions services both automotive OEMs and the battery aftermarket by providing advanced battery technology, coupled with systems engineering, marketing and service expertise. The Company is the largest producer of lead-acid automotive batteries 
4

in the world, producing and distributing approximately 154 million lead-acid batteries annually in approximately 70 wholly- and majority-owned manufacturing or assembly plants, distribution centers and sales offices in approximately 20 countries worldwide. Investments in new product and process technology have expanded product offerings to absorbent glass mat ("AGM") and enhanced flooded battery ("EFB") technologies that power start-stop vehicles, as well as lithium-ion battery technology for certain hybrid and electric vehicles. The business has also invested to develop sustainable lead and poly recycling operations in the North American and European markets. Approximately 75% of unit sales worldwide in fiscal 2018 were to the automotive replacement market, with the remaining sales to the OEM market.
Power Solutions accounted for 25% of the Company’s fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales. Batteries and key components are manufactured at wholly- and majority-owned plants in North America, South America, Asia and Europe.
Competition
Building Technologies & Solutions
The Building Technologies & Solutions business conducts its operations through thousands of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis. Key factors in the award of contracts include system and service performance, quality, price, design, reputation, technology, application engineering capability and construction or project management expertise. Competitors for HVAC equipment, security, fire-detection, fire suppression and controls in the residential and non-residential marketplace include many regional, national and international providers; larger competitors include Honeywell International, Inc.; Siemens Building Technologies, an operating group of Siemens AG; Schneider Electric SA; Carrier Corporation, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation; Trane Incorporated, a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited; Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Lennox International, Inc.; GC Midea Holding Co, Ltd. and Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. In addition to HVAC equipment, Building Technologies & Solutions competes in a highly fragmented HVAC services market, which is dominated by local providers. The loss of any individual contract would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions is the principal supplier of batteries to many of the largest merchants in the battery aftermarket, including Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Robert Bosch GmbH, DAISA S.A., Costco, O’Reilly/CSK, Interstate Battery System of America and Wal-Mart stores. Automotive batteries are sold throughout the world under private labels and under the Company’s brand names (Optima®, Varta®, LTH® and Heliar®) to automotive replacement battery retailers and distributors and to automobile manufacturers as original equipment. The Power Solutions business competes with a number of major U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and distributors of lead-acid batteries, as well as a large number of smaller, regional competitors. The Power Solutions business primarily competes in the battery market with Exide Technologies, GS Yuasa Corporation, Camel Group Company Limited, East Penn Manufacturing Company and Banner Batteries GB Limited. The North American, European and Asian lead-acid battery markets are highly competitive. The manufacturers in these markets compete on price, quality, technical innovation, service and warranty.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog relating to the Building Technologies & Solutions business is applicable to its sales of systems and services. At September 30, 2018, the backlog was $8.7 billion, of which $8.4 billion is attributable to the field business. The majority of backlog relates to fiscal 2019. At September 30, 2017, the backlog was $8.5 billion, of which $8.2 billion is attributable to the field business. The backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.
Raw Materials
Raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations, including lead, steel, tin, aluminum, urethane chemicals, brass, copper, sulfuric acid, polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents, were readily available during fiscal 2018, and the Company expects such availability to continue. In fiscal 2019, commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Generally, the Company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.

The Company owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. The Company, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.
The Company’s trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. The Company, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions.
Most works of authorship produced for the Company, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating the Company’s claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Laws addressing the protection of the environment (environmental laws) and workers’ safety and health (worker safety laws) govern the Company’s ongoing global operations. They generally provide for civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where Company-related materials have been released into the environment.
The Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. Certain of the Company’s businesses are, or have been, engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment. The Company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances.
The Company’s operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, payment of penalties. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," of this report for a discussion of the Company’s potential environmental liabilities.
Environmental Capital Expenditures
The Company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures. Environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in fiscal 2018 related solely to environmental compliance were not material. It is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year.
Government Regulation and Supervision
The Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., in areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. The Company's security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the U.S. are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the Company's fire businesses. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the Company's worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company's business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, the Company employed approximately 122,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 48,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 74,000 were outside the United States. Approximately 31,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good.

Seasonal Factors
Certain of Building Technologies & Solutions sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment generally increases in the summer months. This seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the Building Technologies & Solutions business that have no material seasonal effect.
Research and Development Expenditures
Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures.
