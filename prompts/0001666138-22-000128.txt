Item 1. Business

The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below. Our business, operations and financial position are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and related notes and the Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Company Overview
Atkore Inc. (collectively with all its subsidiaries referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “Atkore,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 4, 2010. Atkore is the sole stockholder of Atkore International Holdings Inc. (“AIH”), which in turn is the sole stockholder of Atkore International, Inc. (“AII”).
We are a leading manufacturer of Electrical products primarily for the non-residential construction and renovation markets, as well as residential markets, and Safety & Infrastructure products for the construction and industrial markets. The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable, and installation accessories. This segment serves contractors in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel. The Safety & Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security, and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure. These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and end-users. We believe we hold #1 or #2 positions in the United States by net sales in the vast majority of our products. The quality of our products, strength of our brands, our scale and national presence provide what we believe to be a unique set of competitive advantages that position us for profitable growth.
Our mission is to be the customer’s first choice by providing unmatched quality, delivery, and value based on sustainable excellence in strategy, people, and processes.
Our Products
Atkore is committed to providing our customers with a safe, sustainable, and innovative portfolio of high quality electrical, mechanical, safety, and infrastructure products and solutions. In total, we serve several end-markets, including new non-residential construction, maintenance, repair and remodel (“MR&R”), residential, OEM, and international markets. 
We continuously seek to improve our product offerings and develop innovative new products that meet the changing needs of our customers, which include industry trends toward digital design tools and labor saving solutions. The majority of Atkore products have Building Information Modeling (“BIM”) models available for our customers’ use. 
Significant product categories within our Electrical segment include metal electrical conduit and fittings, plastic pipe and conduit, electrical cable and flexible conduit, and international cable management systems, which are critical components of the electrical infrastructure for new construction and MR&R markets. Significant product categories within our Safety & Infrastructure segment include mechanical pipe, metal framing & fittings, construction services and perimeter security. Our metal framing products are used in the installation of electrical systems and various support structures, and our mechanical tube products can commonly be found in solar applications. 
Atkore continues to invest to add capabilities and capacity to develop innovative products and solutions to make installation faster and easier. Recent examples of our innovation include the patented MC Glide Tuff armored cable, the winner of the EC&M 2022 Product of the Year in the Wire & Cable category, which facilitates faster and smoother pull through during installations; Eagle Basket, which quickly latches together; and Cellular Core Conduit, which bends easier than PVC conduit.
Customers
We are acutely aware of the importance of our equipment operating reliably, and we strive to deliver the safest, highest quality products. Our sales and marketing processes are primarily focused on serving our customers, including electrical, industrial and specialty distributors, who sell to contractors, and OEMs. We believe customers view Atkore as offering a strong value proposition based on our broad product offering, strong brands, short order cycle times, reliability and consistent product quality. For each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 91%, 90%, and 89% respectively, of our net sales were sold to customers located in the United States. Our net sales by geographic area were as follows: 

 | Fiscal Year Ended 
(in millions) | September 30, 2022 | | September 30, 2021 | | September 30, 2020
United States | $ | 3,553 | | | $ | 2,637 | | $ | 1,563
International | 361 | | | 291 | | | 202
Total | $ | 3,914 | | | $ | 2,928 | | $ | 1,765

Atkore has a well-established customer base, which includes many of the largest companies in their categories. In fiscal 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 38% of net sales. No single customer, even after consolidating all branches of such customer, which often make independent purchasing decisions, accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
Our customers include global electrical distributors (such as Consolidated Electrical Distributors, Inc., Graybar Electric Company, Rexel, Sonepar S.A. and Wesco International, Inc.), independent electrical distributors including super-regional electrical distributors (such as U.S. Electrical Services Inc., Crescent Electric Supply Co. and United Electric Supply Company, Inc.) and members of buying groups (such as Affiliated Distributors, Inc., IMARK Group, Inc. and STAFDA) as well as industrial distributors and big-box retailers (such as The Home Depot, Inc.). We also support alternative energy OEMs, with many applications used in solar system infrastructure.
Manufacturing 
We currently manufacture products in 47 facilities and operate a total footprint of approximately 6.8 million square feet of manufacturing and distribution space in eight countries. Our headquarters are located in Harvey, Illinois, which is also the location of our largest manufacturing facility. Similar to our distribution footprint, our manufacturing footprint is currently concentrated in the United States, with additional facilities in Australia, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

With respect to our tube and conduit products, we believe we are a technology leader in the in-line galvanizing manufacturing process and have developed specialized equipment that enables us to produce a variety of low-cost high-quality galvanized tube products. For example, our subsidiary, Allied Tube & Conduit Corporation, or “Allied Tube,” developed an in-line galvanizing technique (Flo-Coat) in which zinc is applied in a continuous process when the tube and pipe are formed. The Flo-Coat galvanizing process provides superior zinc coverage of fabricated metal products for rust prevention and lower cost manufacturing than traditional hot-dip galvanizing. Another example is our Cellular Core conduit, which employs a co-extrusion process to create three firmly bonded layers with the inner layer as a cellular core, creating a conduit that weighs less and is more flexible while meeting UL standards.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We use a variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products. Our primary raw materials are steel, copper and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) resin. We believe that sources for these raw materials are well-established, generally available and are in sufficient quantity that we may avoid disruption to our business if we encounter an interruption from one of our existing suppliers. Our primary suppliers of steel are Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor; our primary suppliers of copper are AmRod and SDI LaFarga; and our primary suppliers of PVC resin are Westlake, Formosa and Oxy Vinyls. We strive to maintain strong relationships with our suppliers. 
Responsible sourcing and supply chain management are critical to Atkore’s ability to provide high quality products to our customers. We expect our suppliers to carry out Atkore’s values and commitments by using resources responsibly, reducing the environmental footprint of their operations whenever possible, and upholding fair employment and human rights principles as outlined in our Supplier Integrity and Sustainability Standards.
Distribution
Atkore adds value to the customer experience with a comprehensive portfolio of electrical products and strategically located regional distribution centers. Additionally, we drive value for our customers through a single order across our broad product portfolio coupled with services like our ReliaRoutes hub-and-spoke fixed trucking lanes and technologies like our mobile app to track orders and schedule pickups.
We primarily sell and distribute our products through electrical, industrial and specialty distributors and OEMs. For many of the more than 13,000 electrical-distributor branches in the United States, our products are must-stock lines that form a staple of their business. We serve a diverse group of end markets, including new construction, MR&R and infrastructure, diversified industrials, alternative power generation, healthcare, data centers and government. End-users, who are typically electrical, industrial and mechanical contractors as well as OEMs, install our products during non-residential, residential and infrastructure construction and renovation projects or in assembly and manufacturing processes.
Distribution-based sales accounted for approximately 84% of our net sales in fiscal 2022. We distribute our products to electrical and industrial distributors from our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as from over 40 dedicated distribution facilities operated by our agents. Our products are also stocked by electrical and industrial distributors who are located across the United States. Some of our products are purchased by OEMs and used as part of their products and solutions in applications such as utility solar framing, and conveyor systems. OEM sales accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales for fiscal 2022.
Our distribution footprint is concentrated in North America (the United States and Canada), with additional facilities in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
Seasonality 
In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Weather can impact the ability to pursue non-residential construction projects at any time of the year in any geography, but historically, our slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters of each fiscal year when frozen ground and cold temperatures in many parts of the country can impede the start and pursuit of construction projects. Sales of our products have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects. 
Marketing
Our marketing efforts are focused on key stakeholder audiences including electrical and industrial distributors, contractors, engineers, government entities, and OEM customers. These combined efforts communicate the value proposition of the overall Atkore brand by bringing together complementary 
solutions in our portfolio while reinforcing the individual value propositions of our leading sub-brands such as Allied Tube & Conduit, AFC Cable Systems, Kaf-Tech, Heritage Plastics, Unistrut, Power-Strut, Cope, US Tray, FRE Composites, United Poly Systems, Calbond and Calpipe. 
Atkore sales are enabled through external commissioned sales agents and internal sales teams that drive customer acquisition and retention. Our comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions is continually enhanced by driving innovation into our markets with new product introductions, such as the digital tools that support project design and selection.
Prompted by evolving customer needs in an increasingly competitive, cost-and-efficiency conscious construction industry, we refreshed our branding strategy in 2020 from a house of brands to a branded house, uniting all brands under one master brand, Atkore, and adopted the “Building Better Together” theme to demonstrate how we work with our customers and our customers’ customers. An indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and branding strategy is the marketplace recognition Atkore has garnered through several awards in the last 2 years, including the tED Best of the Best Award for Marketing Excellence, an AD Electrical Marketing Excellence Award, and a tED Advertising Award.
Competition 
Our principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional manufacturers and differ by each of our product lines. We also face competition from manufacturers in Canada, Mexico and several other international markets, depending on the product. We believe our customers purchase from us because we provide value through the quality of our products, the breadth of our portfolio and the timeliness of our delivery. Competitive pressures are generally in the areas of product offering, product innovation, quality, service and price. 
The main competitors in each of these segments are listed below: 

Electrical: Zekelman Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Corporation, Nucor Corporation, Southwire Company, LLC, Dura-Line Corporation, and Encore Wire Corporation plc.
Safety & Infrastructure: Zekelman Industries, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, ABB Ltd., Hubbell Incorporated, nVent Electric plc., and Haydon Corporation
Management of Information Technology Systems 
Historically, information technology has not been a significant differentiator for us in our markets, however, we believe that the ease of doing business with us will become increasingly important to our growth and are making significant investments to improve our operations and provide valuable solutions for our customers. Over the past six years, Atkore has made significant investments in technology to improve our business and provide value to our customers.
Currently, we operate our business using commercially available hardware and software products with well-developed support services. In addition to these widely available IT products, we developed a new application for our agents that we believe will improve the overall order entry process. Additionally, during fiscal 2016, we invested in installing and implementing a new general ledger and financial reporting system for the entire Company replacing a number of systems used in various parts of the Company. We have also chosen to migrate our email service and various other information technology services to a cloud computing platform hosted by Microsoft. During fiscal 2019, we completed the implementation of an integrated system for order management, advanced warehouse management, finished goods inventory management and accounts receivable. 
We are in the final stages of a customer-facing technology investment that streamlines the process of designing installation plans, ordering, and managing the process through delivery, providing speed and accuracy not available from our competitors. 
In today’s business environment, cybersecurity is of paramount importance and Atkore has also invested significantly to strengthen our cybersecurity posture.
Human Capital Resources 
Culture
Atkore believes that a culture of engagement and alignment drives continuous improvement, enhances our customers’ experience, and delivers strong performance. 
We aim to foster a workplace where our employees feel aligned with our mission, proud of our culture and engaged in their work. Our annual Employee Engagement and Alignment Survey is one of our primary tools to assess our performance as an employer of choice and to measure employee engagement and satisfaction. 
Atkore operates under a set of core values of Accountability, Teamwork, Integrity, Respect and Excellence and the Atkore Business System, which prioritizes Strategy, People and Processes, the fundamentals of how we Build Better Together. Our culture provides employees with opportunities for personal and professional development as well as community engagement, all of which contribute to our Company’s overall success. In addition to many other awards, in 2020, Atkore was recognized as a Great Place to Work-CertifiedTM company. 
Employee Base
As of September 30, 2022, we employed approximately 5,000 full-time equivalent employees of whom approximately 20% are temporary or contract workers. Our employees are primarily located in the United States, with about 14% employed at our international locations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 
As of September 30, 2022, approximately 18% of our domestic and international employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. All unions are either located in the United States or Canada with no unions or Worker’s Councils at any of our other locations abroad.
From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for re-negotiations. On July 14, 2020, the Company and the United Steelworkers Union, representing approximately 350 employees, reached an agreement on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement for our largest facility in Harvey, Illinois, which expires in April 2024. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Safety, Health and Well-Being
At Atkore, nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our people. We seek to ensure that employees, customers, contractors, and visitors to our facilities go home safely at the end of each day, and we empower everyone to proactively identify and eliminate risks to promote an injury-free and incident-free workplace. 
In 2021, we launched our new safety brand “Let’s Make It Home,” a safety program encompassing our commitment to safety and reinforcing the importance of living our values in order to create a workplace where everyone feels respected, appreciated and safe. Developed by and for employees, Let’s Make It Home makes safety at Atkore personal and reminds everyone that safety is integral to every action. 
In 2021, we also introduced updates to our Life Saving Rules, which provide additional guidance on the actions every employee must take to ensure safe practices across our operations. Our employees are required to receive Atkore Kore Training and Safety Alerts, which cover high-hazard occupational safety concerns and compliance with both internal and external safety and environmental permits. Every one of our sites completes a self-assessment and certification of completion. 
We believe Atkore’s investments in safety, health and well-being are critical to supporting and protecting our most important asset: our people. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At Atkore, we believe that diversity of all types contributes to our success and that our differences make us better. We believe that supporting a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace fosters a culture of openness and innovation. Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) is embedded throughout the company with a range of programs driven by our DE&I Roadmap, which helps us identify and execute specific actions and monitor our progress toward a workplace where all employees feel they belong and are empowered to do their best work. 
In 2021, we integrated DE&I topics into our employee onboarding process and rolled out unconscious bias training for salaried employees. We include the importance of building diverse and inclusive teams in manager training and structure the interview process to minimize implicit biases. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment training. 
We regularly evaluate our progress on DE&I across the company. Our longstanding DE&I Steering Committee leads many of our programs and internal efforts, evaluating how we can continue to improve and create a more inclusive culture. Each employee is encouraged to bring their uniqueness to the Company, which unlocks their individual potential and Atkore’s organizational potential. 
Talent Development and Retention
Our ability to successfully operate, grow and implement key business strategies is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees at all levels of our Company. As part of our human capital resource objectives, we support our employees by using strategic workforce planning to forecast future needs, building, and leveraging an inclusive leadership mindset, and applying a robust talent management process, including our onboarding and immersion program and our monthly organizational leadership review cadence. 
We provide opportunities for advancement through rotational and stretch assignments and best practice leadership roles. In fiscal 2022, approximately 34% of our total positions filled came from internal promotions, highlighting our commitment to developing our employees.
The Company rewards employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including attractive medical plans, retirement plans, opportunities for annual bonuses and, for eligible employees, long-term incentives and equity-based compensation. The Company believes our compensation program allows us to attract and retain talented employees.
Engagement and Alignment 
We have a culture of engagement and alignment and believe fully engaged employees stay focused on being a standout leader, support the decisions of the leadership team and strive for breakthrough results. An aligned employee lives our mission and values, learns our strategic priorities and links their individual goals to those priorities. Our 2022 engagement and alignment survey had an overall participation rate of 78%. In fiscal 2022, 67% of our hourly workforce participated in the survey, compared to 61% of hourly employees in fiscal 2021. The result of the survey showed the following favorable percentages: Engagement 83%; Alignment 86%; Safety 91%; and Diversity Equity & Inclusion 83%.
Human Rights
Atkore is committed to supporting human rights and fair labor practices. We will not tolerate human rights abuses of any kind, including human trafficking, child labor or incidents of corruption within our company or supply chain. Employees are encouraged to report any potential violations or concerns, and all reports are promptly and impartially investigated. 
Our Human Rights Policy defines our dedication to protecting human rights and is driven by our core values and is aligned with national and international principles of human rights. 
Atkore’s Supplier Integrity and Sustainability Standards set forth our expectation that suppliers uphold our commitment to human rights. In 2021, we launched our Supplier Business Review Agenda with several of our largest suppliers to ensure our partners could conduct business in alignment with our values. 
Intellectual Property 
Patents and other proprietary rights can be important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We periodically review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, in an effort to avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 
We own a portfolio of patents and trademarks. Other than licenses to commercially available third-party software, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business taken as a whole. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We rely on both trademark registration and common law protection for trademarks. Trademark rights may potentially extend indefinitely and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. 
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks. For more information on these risks, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes.” 
Regulatory Matters 
Our facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulations including the protection of human health, safety and the environment. Among other things, these laws govern the use, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; regulate emissions or discharges of pollutants or other substances into the air, water, or otherwise into the environment; impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances and protect the health and safety of our employees. 
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital expenditures in addition to ordinary course costs to comply with applicable current and future environmental, health and safety laws, such as those governing air emissions and wastewater discharges. In addition, government agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in our environmental permits which increase our costs. These laws are subject to change, which can be frequent and material. More stringent federal, state or local environmental rules or regulations could increase our operating costs and expenses.
The cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and capital expenditures required to meet regulatory requirements is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position. 

In October 2013, the State of Illinois filed a complaint against our subsidiary Allied Tube, alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, or the “IEPA,” relating to discharges to a storm sewer system that terminates at Allied Tube’s Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. The State sought an injunction ordering Allied Tube to take immediate corrective action to abate the alleged violations and civil penalties as permitted by applicable law. Allied Tube has reviewed management practices and made improvements to its diesel fuel storage and truck maintenance areas to resolve the State’s claims. We entered into a consent order that required Allied Tube to pay a nominal penalty, install base low-flow oil and water separation equipment and take certain additional remedial actions to resolve the State’s claim. The installation of the low-flow oil and water separation equipment is complete and certain additional remediation activities are in progress. We do not currently expect that any remaining obligations would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In August 2014, we received from the IEPA the terms of a proposed new stormwater discharge permit for our Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. Because the facility did not meet the zinc limit set forth in the proposed permit, the Company commenced negotiations with the IEPA to agree upon mutually acceptable discharge limits. During these negotiations, the facility was operating under an extension of the terms of our existing stormwater discharge permit. In October 2016, we received the final permit. A mutually agreed upon compliance plan was part of the permit. The compliance plan included studies to reduce zinc emitted from galvanizing manufacturing operations, implementation of more rigorous discharge management practices, evaluation of the installation of passive/cost effective stormwater treatment and receiving stream studies to determine if a less stringent permit limit would be as protective of the water system as the October 2016 permit limit. The permit was modified in December 2019 to accommodate trials of a metal coating technology that would nearly eliminate the largest source of zinc emissions from our galvanizing operations. Although the metal coating trials were not successful, we have completed the installation of zinc treatment systems for the storm water discharges, are further reducing the zinc emitted from the galvanizing manufacturing operations and are capturing stormwater for treatment and use in our manufacturing process. A new permit was issued August 5, 2021 that included a less stringent permit limit based on the receiving stream evaluation, which also included a one-year start-up / shake-down period to meet the new zinc limit. We continued to keep the IPEA informed on our progress. The facility achieved compliance within the one-year start-up / shake-down period. Ongoing compliance with the stormwater discharge permit is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We are continually investigating, remediating or addressing contamination at our current and former facilities. For example, we are currently monitoring and passively remediating groundwater contamination at our Wayne, Michigan facility. Future remediation activities may be required to address contamination at or migrating from the Wayne, Michigan site. We have maintained good working relationships with the State of Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, Energy, the City of Wayne and the residents surrounding our facility. We hold periodic public meetings to keep the community apprised of the current monitoring data and the remedial efforts taken or planned. We do not expect planned remedial efforts to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Many of our current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which additional investigation and remediation obligations could arise in the future and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
