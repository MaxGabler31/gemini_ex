ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company Background:

During the years from 1999 to 2016 Pacific WebWorks was an application service provider and software development firm that developed business software technologies and services for business merchants and organizations using Internet and other technologies. We specialized in turnkey applications allowing small to medium sized businesses to expand over the Internet. Our product family included tools for web site creation, management and maintenance, electronic business storefront hosting and Internet payment systems for the small to medium sized business and organization. From 2011 to 2016 the Company expanded operations to also include an investment and business consulting arm to seek opportunities in synergistic industries or businesses. 

The Companys business declined precipitously in the second half of 2015 and on February 23, 2016 the Company filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah, and soon afterwards ceased its business activities. On August 19, 2016 the Company proposed a Plan of Liquidation and on November 28, 2016 the Court entered an order confirming the Plan of Liquidation and establishing a Liquidating Trust. On December 28, 2016 all remaining assets and liabilities of the Company were transferred to the Liquidating Trust. In 2017 the Liquidating Trust, with Court approval, collected or sold all remaining assets and made payments to all secured and unsecured creditors such that those claims were paid in full. As a result of these transfers the Company became an empty shell company, with no assets and no liabilities. The Companys only activity in 2017 was the preparation and filing of periodic reports as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 18, 1987, as Asphalt Associates, Inc. and changed its name to Pacific WebWorks, Inc. in January 1999. From 1999 to 2016 it operated as an application service provider and software development firm. As noted above, it filed for bankruptcy in February 2016. 

Description of Current Business:

The Companys sole officer and director has determined that the Company lacks the resources to re-enter the software development business. Therefore, the Companys sole officer and director has determined to seek a merger or an acquisition with a larger, better capitalized entity that will benefit current shareholders. Therefore, as of the date hereof, the Company can be defined as a "shell" company, an entity which is generally described as having no or nominal operations and with no or nominal assets. As a shell company, our purpose at this time, described more fully below, is to negotiate a business agreement or combination with a larger entity which will bring greater value to our shareholders. As of the date hereof, we have not identified any potential merger or acquisition partner.

The Companys sole officer and director believes that a potential merger or acquisition target will be a business which seeks the benefits of our shareholder base or status as a reporting issuer. The Companys sole officer and director will not restrict its search to any specific industry or geographic location. The Companys sole officer and director anticipates that the Company may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because a business partner might require exclusivity. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.

 We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product, or to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital. This discussion of the proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky due to general economic conditions, rapid changes in the business environment, and shortages of available capital. The Companys sole officer and director believes that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of a reporting issuer, but this is by no means certain.

The Companys sole officer and director, Daniel Masters, has agreed to provide the necessary funds, without interest, for the Company to comply with the 1934 Act reporting requirements, provided he is an officer and director of the Company when the obligation is incurred. The officer has not, as of the date hereof, set a maximum dollar amount that he is willing to provide to the Company.

It is anticipated that we will incur nominal expenses in the implementation of the business plan described herein. Because we have no capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses, the Companys sole officer and director will pay these charges with his personal funds, as interest free loans to the Company or as capital contributions. However, if loans, the only opportunity which he will have for repayment of these loans will be from a prospective merger or acquisition candidate.

Acquisition Opportunities:

The sole officer and director of the Company will seek out business combination opportunities through his personal business contacts. Our President regularly attends meetings of the National Investment Banking Association, the San Diego Venture Group, the Los Angeles Venture Association, and similar groups where businesses seeking to expand and investors and related professionals (e.g. consultants, accountants, and attorneys) meet in hopes of working together. The sole officer and director of the Company will not be limited in his search to these groups but believes that these groups will provide a networking platform from which to seek business combination opportunities.

In implementing a structure for a particular business venture, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of an agreement, it is probable that the present officer and director and the present shareholders of the Company will no longer be in control of the Company. In addition, and especially if there is a business combination, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition or merger, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our shareholders or may sell their stock in the Company. It is anticipated that any securities issued by our Company in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of verifying revenue and 

5
 bearing costs, including costs associated with the Companys attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.

It is our present intent that we will not submit a potential merger, acquisition, or similar reorganization to our shareholders for approval. We are incorporated under the laws of Nevada and Nevadas Revised Statutes, Section 78.320, provides that  any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, a written consent thereto is signed by stockholders holding at least a majority of the voting power  In no instance where action is authorized by written consent need a meeting of stockholders be called or notice given.

Our President, Daniel Masters, owns 66.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock; thus his written consent to a potential merger or acquisition constitutes more than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize such a reorganization under Nevada law. Prompt notice of any such action will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K and also on Forms PREM14C and DEFM14C and copies of these filings will be sent by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each of our shareholders. 

Our present intent is that we will not enter into a business combination agreement with an entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements at the time of closing of the proposed transaction and supply other information that is normally disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are subject to all of the reporting requirements included in the 1934 Act. These rules are intended to protect investors by deterring fraud and abuse in the securities markets through the use of shell companies. Included in these requirements is the affirmative duty of the Company to file independent audited financial statements as part of its Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition, as well as the Companys audited financial statements included in its annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, in the filing of the Form 8-K that we file to report an event that causes us to cease being a shell company, we are required to include that information that is normally reported by a company in its original Form 10.

We do not intend to hire an investment banker, a business broker, or a similar professional specializing in business acquisitions. Once a potential acquisition has been identified we do intend to utilize the services of an attorney experienced in business acquisitions to prepare or review the merger or acquisition agreements and documents. Because we have no capital with which to pay legal fees our President, Daniel Masters, has agreed to pay these fees with personal funds, as an interest free loan to the Company or as a capital contribution. However, this is a voluntary agreement; Mr. Masters is not contractually obligated to pay this expense.

Accounting in the Event of a Business Combination

Future business combinations will be recorded in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805 (ASC 805). 

We have been informed that most business combinations will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with us being the surviving registrant. As a result of any business combination, if the acquired entitys shareholders will exercise control over us, the transaction will be deemed to be a capital transaction where we are treated as a non-business entity. Therefore, the accounting for the business combination is identical to that resulting from a reverse merger, except no goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. For accounting purposes, the acquired entity will be treated as the accounting acquirer and, accordingly, will be presented as the continuing entity. 

Issuer Status

Based upon our proposed future business activities, it is likely that we will be deemed a blank check company (see Risk Factors). The Securities and Exchange Commission definition of such a company is a development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its 

6

business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person, and is issuing penny stock.

A penny stock security is any equity security other than a security (i) that is a reported security (ii) that is issued by an investment company (iii) that is a put or call issued by the Option Clearing Corporation (iv) that has a price of $5.00 or more (except for purposes of Rule 419 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) (v) that is registered on a national securities exchange (vi) that is authorized for quotation on the NASDAQ Stock Market, unless other provisions of the defining rule are not satisfied, or (vii) that is issued by an issuer with (a) net tangible assets in excess of $2,000,000, if in continuous operation for more than three years or $5,000,000 if in operation for less than three years or (b) average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years. Our stock will likely be deemed a penny stock.
JOBS Act

The United States Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), which provides for certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are reporting companies and are emerging growth companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to:

·
 have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

·
 comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);

·
 submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and

·
 disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) and the election is irrevocable.

Competition:
 
We will compete with a wide variety of public shell companies seeking reverse acquisitions. These competitors range from operating companies to companies like ours which have no operations, and from 

7
 companies with substantial assets including substantial cash deposits to companies like ours with no assets.
