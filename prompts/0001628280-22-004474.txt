Item 1. Business
Bentley Systems: The Infrastructure Engineering Software Company
We are a leading global provider of software for infrastructure engineering, enabling the work of civil, structural, geoprofessional, and plant engineering practitioners, their project delivery enterprises, and owner‑operators of infrastructure assets. We were founded in 1984 by the Bentley brothers and on September 25, 2020, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”). Our enduring commitment is to develop and support the most comprehensive portfolio of integrated software offerings across professional disciplines, project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure sectors, and geographies. Our software enables digital workflows across engineering disciplines, distributed project teams, from offices to the field, and across computing form factors, including desktops, on-premises servers, cloud-native services, mobile devices, and web browsers. We deliver our solutions via on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. Our users engineer, construct, and operate projects and assets across the following infrastructure sectors:
•public works (including roads, rail, airports, ports, and water and wastewater networks)/utilities (including electric, gas, water, and communications). We estimate that this sector represents 52% of the net infrastructure asset value of the global top 500 infrastructure owners (the “global top 500 infrastructure owners”) based on the 2021 edition of the Bentley Infrastructure 500 Top Owners, our annual compilation of the world’s largest infrastructure owners ranked by net depreciated value of their tangible fixed assets;
•industrial (including discrete and process manufacturing, power generation, and water treatment plants)/resources (including oil and gas, mining, offshore, and environmental). We estimate that this sector represents 34% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value; and
•commercial/facilities (including office buildings, hospitals, and campuses). We estimate that this sector represents 14% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value.
We address both the project and asset lifecycle phases of infrastructure, each with applications and enterprise information systems. Our Project Lifecycle solutions encompass conception, planning, surveying, design, engineering, simulation, and construction, as well as the collaboration offerings required to coordinate and share the work of interdisciplinary and/or distributed project teams. Our Asset Lifecycle solutions span the operating life of commissioned infrastructure assets, allowing our accounts to manage engineering changes for safety and compliance and to model performance and reliability to support operating and maintenance decisions.
Our Solutions
We offer solutions for enterprises and professionals across the infrastructure lifecycle. Our Engineering Applications and Geoprofessional Applications support the breadth of engineering and geoprofessional disciplines and are primarily desktop applications for professional practitioners. Our project delivery and asset performance Enterprise systems are provided via cloud and hybrid environments, developed respectively to extend enterprise collaboration during project delivery, and to manage and leverage engineering information during operations and maintenance. Our Industry Solutions solve domain‑specific problems for owners of infrastructure assets, and the project delivery ecosystems that support these owners. Our cloud-native iTwin Platform solutions enable digital twin workflows, which can span project and asset lifecycles.
Our comprehensive solutions for the entire project delivery and asset performance lifecycle—spanning conception, planning, surveying, geoscience, design, simulation, construction, and operations—include Engineering Applications, Geoprofessional Applications, Enterprise Systems, Industry Solutions, and our iTwin Platform for infrastructure digital twins.
Engineering Applications. Our Engineering Applications are for modeling and simulation. Our modeling applications are domain-specific authoring tools used by professionals for the 3D design and documentation of infrastructure assets. Our simulation applications enable engineers to analyze the functional performance of the designs created with our modeling applications (or those of competitive vendors), preferably in iterative digital workflows, to improve engineering outcomes and to ensure compliance with design codes.
Benefits of our Engineering Applications to infrastructure engineers include:
•Better designs. Our modeling and simulation applications work together to improve infrastructure engineering quality, for instance to eliminate “clashes” across respective disciplines’ work. Each application is for a specific purpose (asset-type or discipline; for example, OpenRoads for roadway design), and supports corresponding asset-specific engineering workflows (for example, the workflow a civil engineer would use in designing a road) by virtue of:
•Better engineering productivity. We endeavor to provide in our applications the most advanced and automated intelligence for transforming engineers’ conceptual decisions into complete, detailed, and editable deliverables; and
•Better configurability and continuity. We take care to enable users to continuously refine their modeling preferences and standards across successive generations of our applications. This capability enables engineers, throughout their careers, to maintain continuity and compatibility with their preferred interfaces, formats, and methodologies, while advancing their work at the leading edge of innovation;
•Better deliverables. Our applications share a common modeling environment to enable streamlined coordination and production of multi-discipline documentation; and
•Better handoff. Our comprehensive modeling environment and our supplemental cloud services enable projects to enrich information sharing (and to minimize problematic translations) across project delivery processes. For instance:
•by starting with reality modeling of existing conditions (often from drone surveying);
•by sharing engineering component definitions across disciplines and projects; and
•through “constructioneering” digital workflows, which automate the exchange of 3D design models to control GPS-enabled construction equipment (for earthmoving and paving), and to validate and preserve the resulting 3D as‑built models for maintenance.
Geoprofessional Applications. Our Geoprofessional Applications support modeling and simulation to help engineers and scientists develop a detailed understanding, and take full account of, near and deep subsurface conditions.
Our recent acquisition of Seequent Holdings Limited (“Seequent”) adds industry‑leading earth modeling, geoscience‑data management, and geoprofessional team collaboration software to our portfolio. The integration of these sophisticated technologies in combination with our existing geotechnical products, supplements visible built asset representations above ground with more probabilistic modeling of invisible subsurface conditions – deepening the potential of infrastructure digital twins.
Benefits of our geoprofessional applications to infrastructure professionals include:
•Delivering a clearer picture of what lies beneath. Our geodata modeling and visualization technologies helps geoprofessionals see what lies in the subsurface. When they can see it, they can understand it and make better decisions that reduce ground risk throughout the project lifecycle – saving budget and compressing timelines;
•Connecting workflows. As infrastructure and engineering projects become ever more complex, users need greater confidence in the earth sciences disciplines which support all surface infrastructure. The combination of Seequent’s subsurface geoscience and our existing geotechnical products means users have more flexibility in how they comprehensively solve complex geoscience and engineering problems; and
•Better decisions that benefit people and the planet. Our geoprofessional applications help geoprofessionals to develop vital mineral resources more sustainably, design and build better infrastructure, protect the environment, source renewable energy, and help resolve historical challenges such as groundwater contamination. Our technology enables engineers and geoprofessionals to collaborate - ensuring infrastructure digital twins can reach full subsurface depths and augment environmental and economic resilience.
Enterprise Systems. Our Enterprise Systems support data management and collaborative workflows for both project delivery and asset performance.
Project Delivery Systems. Our Project Delivery systems support information and document management, engineering‑specific collaboration and work‑sharing for distributed project teams and enterprises, and construction planning, modeling and execution. The scope of these solutions is not limited to users of only our own engineering applications.
Often during the project delivery lifecycle, key data are constantly changing, with inputs received from multiple sources, resulting in the need for a single source of information that is used to collect, manage, and disseminate information for the whole project team. Our software assures that the rapidly-changing data are managed in a common data environment (“CDE”) such that only the correct milestone versions can be shared and referenced across the project. This functionality enables infrastructure project organizations to “virtualize” their talent so that the required work can be shared by all participants everywhere through our software, reducing the need for physical co-location of the project resources.
Our 4D construction modeling software spatially and temporally integrates a project’s 3D engineering models into its construction schedules to assess sequencing strategies and to visualize and understand planned and actual progress over the project timeline. Our solutions also enable project delivery teams to optimally define and manage discrete engineering, construction, and installation work packages, including the construction trades’ “workface planning,” which considers crafts and materials by day and zone. For work packages, which increasingly take advantage of modular offsite fabrication and manufacturing, our software manages and enables 4D visualization of the necessary spatial and logistical interfaces.
Benefits of our Project Delivery systems to project delivery enterprises include:
•Distributed work-sharing. Our solutions incorporate the rigorous workflow protocols required for structured coordination across engineering and construction supply chains and across geographies, enabling global sourcing for integrated project delivery, while maximizing economics, quality, and safety;
•Comprehensive collaboration. Our software leverages cloud and hybrid environments to streamline the aggregation, distribution, and interaction for project deliverables, ensuring that the right project participants have the right information in the right format at the right time, including at the project site and on every device; and
•Construction visibility. Our solutions’ broad span and continuous detail across design integration, construction modeling and work packaging, and mixed‑reality 4D visualization, advances predictability, accountability, and safety throughout the construction process.
Asset Performance Systems. Our Asset Performance systems span the operating life of commissioned infrastructure assets, capturing and managing changes to engineering models and enterprise information for compliance and safety, and to model performance and reliability to support operating and maintenance decisions.
Our Asset Performance systems are used to manage engineering information and geospatial relationships for operating and provisioning infrastructure across all sectors, including linear networks for transportation, energy transmission and distribution, water, and communications. Our asset performance modeling provides the needed analytical context for “right-time” data, including from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensor capabilities, to yield actionable insights.
Benefits of our Asset Performance systems for owner‑operators include:
•Better compliance and assurance. Our systems intrinsically enforce the rigor appropriate for operating infrastructure assets in order to provide dependable visibility into the impact of changes;
•Better asset performance. Our solutions include operational dashboards that provide decision support insights to maintain and improve throughput and reliability; and
•Better risk management. Our solutions include predictive analytics that identify potential problems before they occur and ensure the accessibility of best‑available engineering information and models for mitigation and resilience.
Industry Solutions. Our Industry solutions solve domain‑specific problems for owners of infrastructure assets, and the project delivery ecosystems that support these owners. These offerings span reality modeling, urban mobility simulation, and design and engineering of utility and communication networks; and support fit‑for‑purpose infrastructure digital twins through configurations of our iTwin Platform.
Benefits of our current Industry solutions include:
•Evergreen reality models. Our reality modeling software maintains engineering‑ready 3D models of cities, asset sites, or project sites, incorporating incrementally updated surveys, and thus ensures that project teams or engineering departments can rely on up‑to‑date geospatial context for digital workflows;
•Domain specific solutions. Our Industry solutions for transportation owners solve such problems as managing their assets, bridge inspections, and determining safe routes for oversize or overweight vehicles. For cities, our solutions help with planning, visualization, and mapping, including 3D mobile mapping. For utilities, our solutions help in the design and operation of electric distribution and transmission networks and substations, and gas and district energy networks;
•Better resilience. Our solutions can integrate geotechnical, structural/seismic, and hydrological engineering modeling with evergreen 3D city models to harden infrastructure from flood and other natural hazards, and to apply engineering simulations for mitigation and emergency response;
•Resource conservation. Taking full advantage of our solutions can significantly increase efficiency and reduce waste. For instance, our water network modeling tools, applied to compare “as‑designed” specifications to observed flows and pressures, can help to non‑invasively locate subsurface water network leaks; and
•Fit‑for‑purpose infrastructure digital twins. We leverage our deep domain expertise and our iTwin Platform to support fit‑for‑purpose digital twins, such as our current offerings for industrial plants, water and wastewater networks, and communications towers.
iTwin Platform. Our iTwin Platform for infrastructure digital twin offerings enable our users to create and curate cloud‑native 4D digital representations of physical infrastructure assets, incorporating underlying engineering information, federated with operational data, and then to model, simulate, analyze, chronicle, and predict performance over time. Using digital twins, our users can more fully extend digital workflows across project delivery and asset performance, increasing the value of infrastructure engineers’ work.
Our digital twins technology is built on our iTwin Platform, which we use to build cloud services to enable digital twin workflows for a wide range of potential use cases. We have used the iTwin Platform to create cloud services which add digital twin capabilities to our project delivery and asset performance offerings, to create fit‑for‑purpose digital twin solutions for specific asset classes, and to support an emerging ecosystem of third-party developers.
Third parties can participate in this ecosystem by using iTwin.js, an open‑source development library, to develop desktop, mobile, or web apps that leverage the iTwin Platform or that augment iTwin products from us or from other third parties. While iTwin.js is open source, use of the iTwin Platform or of our products built on the iTwin Platform do require licenses from us.
Applications from Bentley Systems and third parties can participate in digital twin workflows through connectors, which enable any engineering file format to populate the iTwin Platform database schema. The iModel database is a distributed database based on a semantically intelligent infrastructure schema. It maintains transactional information to manage change as data is added or changed.
Benefits of our digital twin solutions to project delivery firms and owner‑operators include:
•Managing change. The design and construction of an infrastructure asset is complex and can take many years with participation of many different organizations working together as a widely distributed team. An operational asset may be designed to last many decades, with even more different stakeholders. Managing data transactions (who, what, when) against a timeline is key to enabling many digital twin workflows, such as revisiting why a design change was made at a particular point in time, orchestrating data from contributing disciplines to conduct design reviews, or comparing the performance of an asset at different points in time;
•Advanced insights. For project delivery, digital twins can reveal insights beyond what would be visible with traditional workflows; for example, a digital twin can show 3D heat maps highlighting where changes in a design have been unusually pervasive, indicating possible design flaws. For asset performance, such insights from digital twins can be used to evaluate different strategies for optimizing operational efficiencies and throughput;
•Predictive analytics. For project delivery, digital twins and machine learning can compare the progress of a current project with similar projects that have been previously completed, and identify in advance potential bottlenecks, in time to take corrective action. For asset performance, a digital twin can track observations from various operational inputs against design intelligence to predict future failures and recommend maintenance actions to minimize downtime;
•Continuous and comprehensive design reviews. For project delivery, digital twins can aggregate and align design models and data from all sources “on the fly” (without interruptions for translations, and without specialized software) to present immersive 3D status visualization in a web browser for any authorized stakeholder to participate in ongoing interactive design reviews;
•Convergence of OT, IT, and now ET. Infrastructure owner‑operators are increasingly able to instrument their assets with IoT sensors, producing torrents of Operational Technology (“OT”) data that are difficult to interpret. Software advances in Information Technology (“IT”) can in turn make data from enterprise transaction systems, such as maintenance work order history, accessible for analytics. But even OT and IT together cannot inform decisions for improved asset performance as sufficiently as when combined with accessibility to comparable analytics from the assets’ engineering models, which we refer to as the Engineering Technology (“ET”). Infrastructure digital twins notably enable the convergence of ET with OT and IT. With infrastructure digital twins, the design intent (the “digital DNA” captured in the digital twins’ engineering models and simulations) can serve as a baseline for comparison to IoT-monitored “as‑operated” performance, in light of the asset’s operations and maintenance history stored in IT systems, to enable integrated analytics to provide timely insights and recommended actions to optimize safety and performance; and
•Addressing a wide range of emerging use cases. There are proliferating use cases to address infrastructure lifecycle issues that are made possible by semantically opening up engineering data to be combined with observed operational data. Many of these use cases have heretofore been impractical by virtue of having required multiple disconnected steps in a manual process. For example, maintenance of a bridge traditionally depends upon manual visual inspections, generally requiring human inspectors climbing precariously to capture photographs and to produce written inspection assessments. The work can be dangerous, and entail subjective judgements which may not be repeatable. A digital twin for a bridge, on the other hand, advances periodic inspections to more continuous and/or real-time monitoring. Sensors on the bridge can gather data on traffic flow, vibration, and other indicators. Drones can (increasingly autonomously) capture imagery to be processed into a high-resolution reality model of the bridge, to which artificial intelligence (machine learning) can be applied to recognize cracks, corrosion, or other defects or changes in the bridge that may affect structural integrity. The digital twin’s structural models (which were initially developed to validate the “as‑designed” capacity) can then be reapplied to the “as‑operated” bridge conditions, to indicate to engineers potential needs for maintenance or remediation interventions. In addition to comparable operational engineering use cases for every existing infrastructure asset, there are at least as many non-engineering use cases where infrastructure digital twins can be leveraged, such as 3D city models being used to adapt for mobility and safety under pandemic lockdowns.
Comprehensiveness of Our Offerings
Our offerings are comprehensive across professional disciplines, lifecycle stages, infrastructure sectors, and geographies, resulting in what we believe to be durable competitive advantages:
Professional Disciplines. Each infrastructure project requires seamless and deep collaboration among professional disciplines, which can include civil, structural, geotechnical, geoscience subsurface engineers, and process engineers, architects, geospatial professionals, city and regional planners, contractors, fabricators, and operations and maintenance engineers. Our open modeling and open simulation applications facilitate iterative interactions between disciplines and coordination across project participants. Additionally, we believe our collaboration systems lead the market in managing infrastructure engineering firms’ preferred work-in-progress workflows.
For example, to illustrate the benefits of interdisciplinary digital workflows in roadway design, our offerings’ comprehensiveness can enhance both safety and economics by enriching the interfaces between geotechnical (earthworks) and structural analyses to share full 3D modeling details. Previously, structural decisions tended to be based on just a single imported parameter for subsurface foundation strength, frequently resulting in designs that included specifications and reinforcing materials beyond what was necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.
The importance of integrating our offerings broadly across disciplines is also a reason that we have always prioritized interoperability with competitors’ design tools. For major projects, owners and their contractors want to have the choice of the best professionals in every discipline, rather than limiting their choices to those using a particular software vendor’s applications. Our offerings win acceptance within major organizations and projects both through our breadth of applications, and through each application’s virtuosity in interpreting and emulating formats beyond our own.
Lifecycle Stages. Both project delivery enterprises and owner‑operators benefit from our solutions, which enable digital workflows to extend between project and asset lifecycles, from design to construction and ultimately asset management. This capability allows our users’ digital engineering models to be leveraged as the context for real-time condition monitoring to achieve better and safer operations and maintenance.
For an example of advantageous digital workflows from projects to assets, consider our solutions for permitting and routing of over‑weight and over‑sized loads by departments of transportation. Instead of routing based merely on static maximum load ratings for each bridge, we use actual bridge design models for dynamic structural simulations, and 3D clearances of the actual load configurations. As a result, user organizations are able to engineer safe routes to maximize commerce while protecting bridge longevity.
Infrastructure Sectors. Most major engineering and project delivery firms pursue an ever‑changing mix of projects across the public works/utilities, industrial/resources, and commercial/facilities sectors and for flexibility tend to favor an infrastructure engineering software vendor whose portfolio correspondingly spans their full breadth. This comprehensiveness provides diversification for our own business, as an incidental advantage. For example, when there have been cyclical downturns in the primarily privately‑financed industrial/resources and commercial/facilities sectors, we have historically witnessed offsetting counter‑cyclical government investment in public works/utilities.
Geographies. While design codes may vary by country, infrastructure purposes and engineering practices are fundamentally the same throughout the world, which makes it possible for our infrastructure modeling applications to be used globally. Our offerings are available in most major languages, supporting country‑specific design codes, standards, and conventions. Our development teams are also globally dispersed, due in part to acquisitions made in various countries, but also to provide any needed last mile localization of our applications. Our global comprehensiveness enables our project delivery accounts to compete more efficiently across geographic markets, thus also providing global supply‑chain sourcing choices for owners.
The Digital Twins Opportunity
We believe that digital progress in infrastructure advancement has to date lagged behind other economic domains for several reasons, including that:
•most existing infrastructure assets predate engineering modeling software;
•engineers’ work, including by way of building information modeling (“BIM”) or geographic information systems (“GIS”), has been sequestered in native file formats that amount to “dark data,” inaccessible without the software that was used to create it, and therefore unavailable for use in digital workflows or analytics; and
•construction processes are often fragmented and isolated from digital workflows altogether, resulting in engineering information being effectively abandoned between the project and the asset lifecycle phases of infrastructure.
Over our company’s history, as computing capabilities have advanced, the scope of infrastructure engineering software has correspondingly increased. However, project and asset lifecycle software markets have developed independently from one another and connecting digital workflows have not been offered. We believe that the new advancement of BIM and GIS to “evergreen” infrastructure digital twins will have the effect of merging what have to date been separate market spaces as well as enabling new use cases that were not possible or practical with previous technologies.

Period | Project Lifecycle Software | Asset Lifecycle Software 
1985 – 1995 | 2D Drafting (“Computer Aided Design” or “CAD”): Workstations and then personal computers make possible interactive graphical applications to automate the creation of previously manually drafted 2D engineering drawings. | 2D Mapping: Workstations and personal computers make possible interactive graphical applications to automate the creation of maps. 
1996 – 2005 | Collaboration: Networked personal computers and servers provide platforms for file-sharing and referencing. CDEs are introduced. | GIS: Networked personal computers and servers enable querying and visualization of geographic data. 
2006 – 2015 | 3D BIM: Increased personal computing power enables the development of 3D applications for design of specific asset types including buildings, process plants, roads, water networks, and buildings. CDEs and the internet lead to global work-sharing and collaborative BIM. | Geospatial: Increased computing address space enables geo-coordinated engineering models. GPS technology enables alignment of digital components and real-world coordinates.Asset Performance Management (“APM”): solutions are introduced for reliability-centered maintenance and risk-based inspection.
2015 – 2018 | Reality Modeling: Advances in digital imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs” or “drones”), and specialized software enable the automated capture of “as-operated” conditions of an asset or site in an engineering-ready, geo-coordinated 3D model. Cloud ubiquity enables Common Data Environments to evolve into Connected Data Environments. | APM evolves into Asset Performance Modeling, with engineering models recalibrated to reproduce and understand observed behaviors, and apply algorithms and analytics to derive insights and drive decisions. 
2019 – Present | 4D Digital Twins: Digital twins make possible the simulation of the behavior and the visualization of the changes of a project or infrastructure asset over time. Digital twins are continually updated in a cloud database and remain current and “evergreen,” over the full project and asset lifecycle, through continuous surveying of the physical context and embedded links to inputs from connected IoT sensors in the operating asset. With digital twins, users are empowered to better understand the impact of changes over time for projects and assets to improve project, construction, and operational efficiencies, predictability, and overall outcomes.

To enable infrastructure engineering to catch up to other sectors and to advance in “going digital,” we have enabled infrastructure digital twins, cloud‑provisioned digital representations of projects and assets that incorporate and converge their 3D physical conditions (“digital context”) for reality, their underlying engineering information (“digital components”) for veracity, and their 4D timeline of changes (“digital chronology”) for fidelity, enabling the merging of project and asset lifecycle workflows.
Digital twin solutions are now made possible by new technologies including UAVs and their intrinsic “surveying” sensors, machine learning, cloud computing, open‑source development libraries, distributed ledger software, and mixed‑reality visualization.
Our software to leverage these advancements for digital twin offerings includes:
•Reality modeling software, which processes any combination of overlapping digital photography, video, and scanned imagery to produce a 3D reality model. Our software then uses machine learning to recognize and classify components within the 3D model (such as equipment, structural elements, pipes, valves, tags, and nameplates). This process populates the reality model’s digital context with these digital components, adding intelligence which can be aligned with engineering models from the design stage;
•iModels, which can be created through connectors which we provide for our own engineering applications or for the major third‑party applications (and which can be developed for any others using our Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”)). Connectors transform data from the application’s proprietary format to correspond to the iModel’s distributed database schema. Since the iModel schema is comprehensive across infrastructure engineering disciplines (and can be extended as needed), all project and asset data can be aligned semantically and spatially with all other relevant models and data, allowing all this information to be accessed and queried to maximize the digital twin’s values of reality, veracity, and fidelity; and
•iTwin Platform cloud services, which provides a range of cloud services to support digital twin solutions. At its core is the iModelHub, a cloud service that hosts and manages change to a digital twin’s data, keeping it synchronized as required with physical and engineering changes. Our iTwin services can be added to any user’s or accounts’ environments to generate incremental value by incorporating infrastructure engineering data within cloud-native evergreen digital twins. The go‑to‑market strategy for our iTwin cloud includes:
•Sales to accounts using ProjectWise and AssetWise of complementary services built on the iTwin Platform, such as ProjectWise Design Review Service for comprehensive project‑wide 4D design review and status visibility;
•Sales of new solutions purposely built on the iTwin platform, such as PlantSight;
•Adding digital twin capabilities to an existing offering “powered by iTwin”, such as SYNCHRO; and
•Creation of a third-party ecosystem developing solutions built on the iTwin platform, using our open source iTwin.js APIs, by leveraging our acceleration initiatives such as iTwin Ventures, which invests in early-stage software companies building infrastructure digital twin solutions.
We believe that the growing adoption of infrastructure digital twins will serve to overcome the factors that have held back the digital advancement of infrastructure engineering, and will facilitate the broader use of intelligent engineering data in the operation of infrastructure assets. Moreover, we believe that due to the comprehensiveness of our solutions across project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure digital twins and newly enabled digital workflows spanning design, construction, and operations, will most particularly benefit our users and enhance our competitiveness.
Our Growth Strategies
We employ the following growth strategies to address the infrastructure engineering software market opportunities:
•Accretion within existing accounts. Most of our accounts currently use a small portion of our overall portfolio, even though they are often working on projects and assets where a large portion of our portfolio could be applied. We believe we can further penetrate our existing accounts by broadening their use of our portfolio. There are three primary mechanisms for this expansion:
•New commercial formulations. We continually innovate with new commercial formulations to align the use of our software to the needs of our users. We offer options enabling unrestricted access to our comprehensive software portfolio by the day, month, quarter, and year. We believe the flexibility in our commercial models and deployment options facilitates our accounts’ continuous growth in usage. In particular, enterprise 365 (“E365”) is our premier enterprise subscription that bundles virtually-delivered expert services, through a structured execution process, with our software, enabling us to work strategically with subscriber accounts to achieve the business outcomes they seek;
•Automating user engagement. We employ various technologies to drive user engagement. These technologies help to automate the user experience and drive engagement by suggesting and recommending best practices and appropriate software upgrades, as well as providing access to our deep bench of domain experts. We will continue to leverage these interactive technologies to virtually assist our users and drive engagement across our software offerings; and
•Adding new offerings. We have a history of building and maintaining leadership in infrastructure software engineering comprehensiveness and intend to continue to innovate and develop our software offerings. Selected recent examples of our product innovations include the introduction of newly integrated multi‑disciplinary modeling and simulation applications since 2019 for offshore wind turbines, since 2020 for 5G‑ready communications towers, and since 2021 to incorporate Seequent’s geoprofessional applications for subsurface digital twins. Over the near term, we believe our iTwin Platform’s cloud services represent a compelling opportunity to enhance value for our accounts. We intend to continue to develop and integrate new products and capabilities over time.
•Focusing on Asia. We believe Asia represents a large market opportunity and will continue to do so over the foreseeable future. According to the Oxford Economics Outlook, a majority of expected infrastructure spending for the period through 2040 is expected to occur in Asia. Additionally, we believe that in Asia there is an abundance of skilled engineers whose work can be virtually exported, as well as engineering organizations that are eager and aggressive to win mandates for engineering and construction projects around the world. We intend to continue investing in strategies to enhance our market position in Asia.
•Increasing inside sales. Historically, our account management resources have focused on larger firms. Smaller- and medium‑sized engineering firms, however, represent a significant market opportunity and have the same needs for our comprehensive portfolio as the larger firms. While these firms have generally been served by our competitors’ channel partners, we believe they will prefer to deal directly with us. We will continue to expand our global inside sales resources and to multiply their reach and effectiveness with superior digital tools to convert leads and to provide the self‑service administration that engineering practitioners prefer.
•Digital co-ventures. We have forged substantial alliances with other major participants in the infrastructure engineering supply chain, primarily to jointly develop and offer digital twin cloud services that extend the scope of our software. These alliances include:
•Siemens AG (“Siemens”): Our partnership integrates leading industrial software and IoT capabilities for a broad joint development program focused on improving outcomes during infrastructure operations and maintenance through digital workflows enabled by digital twins cloud services; and
•Microsoft: Our partnership extends Azure‑powered machine learning and analytics through digital workflows for infrastructure professionals and enterprises.
•Investing in programmatic acquisitions. Since our founding, we have purposefully pursued a strategy of regularly acquiring and integrating specialized infrastructure engineering software businesses. Our acquisitions have the following purposes:
•Filling in the breadth and depth of our comprehensive applications portfolio across disciplines and infrastructure sectors, especially where the developer organizations have already worked on integration and compatibility with our platforms and APIs;
•Extending our lifecycle comprehensiveness;
•Adding new horizontal technologies that we can incorporate within our platforms for the benefit of our applications and systems at large, such as reality modeling; and 
•Adding new distribution capacity, such as acquiring channel partners in geographies where we wish to accelerate our scale and growth.
Our executive management and our dedicated “BSY Investments” team (our executive team focused on portfolio development, mergers and acquisitions, venture capital investing, digital integrator business activities, and various incubating and accelerating business activities) proactively identify, develop, and evaluate acquisition opportunities across various disciplines and infrastructure sectors, and also consider unsolicited opportunities. We have a disciplined and robust diligence and valuation process for evaluating acquisition targets. Our general practice is to fully assimilate the acquired companies’ functions into our global functional structure as quickly as possible, supported by a dedicated team to manage and streamline the integration process. However, for rare “platform” acquisitions beyond our typical programmatic scale, we may choose to “onboard” in a different manner that would least jeopardize continuity of their independent momentum. We prioritize the retention and development of the incoming colleagues from our acquisitions, including offering talent mobility for key personnel. Further, many of our current executives are former founders and/or executive officers of companies we have acquired.
•Investing to develop an ecosystem in support of infrastructure digital twin adoption. Through our BSY Investments team, in addition to the aforementioned acquisition activities, we pursue strategic investments to enhance and grow our core software business with the objective of cultivating an ecosystem to stimulate the adoption of infrastructure digital twins. These investments may take the form of acquisitions, wholly owned start-up initiatives, minority equity stakes, alliances, or loans. BSY Investments’ responsibilities include:
•Digital Integrator Businesses are our relatively service‑intensive businesses that stimulate pull‑through demand for our solutions. Certain of our recent digital integrator activities include: (i) The Cohesive Companies, a consolidation of several acquisitions during 2020 and 2021, as well as certain legacy Bentley Systems professional services businesses. The Cohesive Companies provide advisory, systems integration, and technology strategies and services to help owner-operators advance their BIM, enterprise asset management, asset lifecycle information, and asset performance modeling environments; and (ii) Digital Construction Works, Inc. (“DCW”), a joint venture with Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. (“Topcon”), which integrates leading surveying technologies, geospatial machine control technologies and IoT technologies to augment digital twins and derived workflows in construction operations and infrastructure asset monitoring activities;
•iTwin Ventures is our business for investing up to $100 million of corporate venture capital funding for seed, early, and growth stage technology companies with promising and emerging opportunities for infrastructure digital twin solutions strategically relevant to our business. We operate and govern the activities of iTwin Ventures as a distinct venture capital business, and refer to this business as our iTwin Ventures corporate venture capital fund for both internal and external branding purposes; and
•Acceleration Activities are our vehicle for investing in initiatives with unusually high growth opportunity or where we see a need to incubate solutions to augment our current portfolio of products and services. Such initiatives presently include (i) investment in our OpenTower solution and related go-to-market activities to assist owners and operators of telecom towers rapidly transitioning to 5G and embracing digital twins to manage their critical tower assets; (ii) investing in, incubating, and integrating our sensemetrics and Vista Data Vision acquisitions to establish infrastructure IoT standardization and integration of IoT data into the Bentley Systems’ iTwin platform and to help digital twins remain evergreen by comparing the asset’s behavior to its design and construction specifications; and (iii) integrating and investing in go‑to‑market initiatives for our recently acquired Power Line Systems business to rapidly scale to address the looming demand and accumulating support and funding to harden, optimize, and expand the world’s electrical grids.
The forgoing activities of BSY Investments may have lower initial margin contribution than the mainstream of our software business activities due to the professional services nature of digital integrator revenues, due to the seed or early‑stage nature of the investments, or due to the focused and upfront investments to demonstrate technologies and accelerate market position and/or scale advantages for future returns.

iTwin Platform
Our iTwin Platform for infrastructure digital twins enables Bentley Systems and other third‑party developers to build solutions for a wide range of potential digital twin use cases. We have used this platform to create cloud services which complement and extend project delivery systems and asset performance systems offerings, to create fit‑for‑purpose industry digital twin solutions, and to support an emerging ecosystem of third‑party developers.
New complementary services leveraging the iTwin Platform for current products will be marketed and monetized under their existing brands. We may also incorporate iTwin capabilities to enhance currently monetized offerings. New products created on the iTwin Platform will have their own distinct branding and pricing. All will use the designation “Powered by iTwin” to help identify where the iTwin Platform advances have been leveraged.
The iTwin brand is reserved for the iTwin Platform. Its many cloud services will be leveraged both by us and by third‑party solutions.
Our Commercial Offerings
Licensing Models
Our applications are offered through perpetual licenses or term licenses, priced dependent on the country of purchase and use. Most accounts owning perpetual licenses subscribe to our SELECT coverage which, in addition to providing support and upgrades, enables the use of their licenses for each product to be pooled within each country. For most larger accounts (generally a minimum of $250,000 annualized recurring revenues), we have traditionally offered an enterprise license subscription (“ELS”), which entitles unlimited use of any of our applications for an annual fixed fee, reset annually generally based on actual usage (within each country) for the previous year. During the fourth quarter of 2018, to respond to and improve upon new commercial models offered by peers and competitors, we introduced a new global consumption‑based plan with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, E365 subscription, which is priced uniformly per application per day of actual usage in any country, and inclusive of Success Services (described below) by our colleagues to assist with expanding and gaining the most value from usage of our software. Most of our largest ELS accounts have upgraded to E365, and many of the remainder, and of our largest SELECT subscriber accounts, continue to upgrade each quarter.
Our ProjectWise and AssetWise enterprise systems are offered under our cloud services subscription program, charged quarterly based on actual users of “passports” and “visas” for various levels of functionality. Passport and visa pricing include Azure provisioning at our cost, although some accounts elect to continue on‑premises and/or hybrid hosting. CSS commercial models entail an annual funding commitment, generally paid upfront, based on an estimation of services to be used for the upcoming year. Actual consumption is monitored and invoiced against the deposit on a calendar quarter basis. Accounts are charged only for what gets used, and deposited amounts never expire. At the end of 2021, accounts representing approximately 60% of our total annualized recurring revenues had chosen to institute our new commercial models of CSS and/or E365 consumption funding for licensing of our software.
User Success
Over the last two years, we have reorganized our activities focused on substantive support for existing users and their accounts into our new User Success group, now consisting of approximately 600 colleagues, most with domain experience and credentials in infrastructure engineering. User Success has enabled us to transition from traditional paradigms of on‑demand technical support, and episodically contracted professional services, to instead delivering proactive and continuous engagement with users and accounts through “Success Plans.” Success Plans are designed with our accounts’ business outcomes in mind ensuring that users and accounts maximize the value achieved from our solutions. Working collaboratively with our accounts, User Success Specialists deliver Success Plans through structured engagements based on explicit and standardized “Success Blueprints” that include annual planning, virtual or in-person engagements with subject matter experts, and quarterly business reviews. Typically, our User Success colleagues engage with our accounts remotely. Success Plans, based on allotted credits toward multiple Success Blueprints per calendar quarter, are bundled into our new E365 commercial program which has grown rapidly among our larger accounts.
Our Accounts
We provide our software solutions to over 39,000 accounts in 186 countries worldwide. Our revenues are balanced and diversified between engineering and construction contracting firms who work together to deliver the design and construction of capital projects (representing 56%, 57%, and 55% of our 2021, 2020, and 2019 total revenues, respectively), and their clients, the world’s public and private infrastructure asset owners and operators (representing 44%, 43%, and 45% of our 2021, 2020, and 2019 total revenues, respectively).
We do not have material account concentration. No account, including any group of accounts under common control or accounts that are affiliates of each other, represented more than 2.5% of our total revenues in 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Our Technology
Our business is singularly focused on software for infrastructure engineering, primarily for the world’s largest projects and assets. As a result, we manage our software products to meet constraints imposed for fitness to this purpose. Our market position is built on several reputational hallmarks, including:
•generational stability of file formats, corresponding to the long lives of infrastructure projects and assets;
•commitment to openness and interoperability with competitors’ file formats;
•continuity of software applications’ lifecycles, never jeopardizing users’ cumulative investments by requiring them to “start over”; and
•highest capacity and performance, versus competitors, for large infrastructure models and datasets.
Application Framework
Our software solutions are delivered using flexible, reusable, and open technology, which results in highly integrated applications and cloud services that support comprehensive digital workflows in a scalable manner. For example, our modeling and simulation applications, including MicroStation, leverage a set of reusable components for graphics editing, visualization, solid modeling, and other capabilities. This open framework supports the addition of domain specific features, allowing us to offer highly compatible and well-integrated discipline‑specific applications based on this common framework.
Microsoft Integration
Our software leverages Microsoft’s platform technologies. We seek to take full advantage of integration with Microsoft Office 365 and other horizontal applications such as Teams for workflows that unify our engineering applications within enterprise environments across all computing form factors and devices.
iTwin Platform
Our iTwin Platform is a collection of cloud services used to create, curate, and leverage digital twins. The platform is used by us to create complementary digital twin offerings for current products, to embed digital twin capabilities in current products, and to support fit‑for‑purpose digital twin solutions for particular domains. Third parties can use the iModel.js open-source APIs to create desktop, mobile, and web apps, as well as cloud services and agents, that leverage and extend the iTwin Platform. They can create new digital twin solutions or provide complementary applications or services to existing Bentley Systems and third‑party solutions. The iTwin platform is managed by us on Azure providing anywhere, anytime access to infrastructure digital twin solutions for all stakeholders.
Our Licensing and Administration Platform
All of our applications and systems share a cloud‑native platform for license pooling, management of subscription entitlements, and usage reporting for us and for accounts, including for commercial consumption metrics. Our platform also logs usage of particular “instrumented” functions within our applications to enable our Success Plans to be of most value. Our platform can also provide in-application messaging to users from our User Success group.
Our Acquisitions
Since our founding, we have purposefully pursued a strategy of regularly acquiring and integrating specialized infrastructure engineering software businesses, including 33 acquisitions over the past five years.
As a public company, we have been able to make platform acquisitions which appreciably increase our scale and/or the scope of our platform capabilities. Our platform acquisitions have been:
•Seequent (2021), and subsequent complementary programmatic acquisitions, to enable infrastructure digital twin capabilities to incorporate modeling and simulation of full subsurface depths, and advancing infrastructure resilience and sustainability by helping geoprofessionals to understand environmental conditions and to mitigate environmental risks; and
•Power Line Systems (2022), to bring design, analysis, and management of overhead electric power transmission lines and structures to our grid digital twin solutions. Power Line Systems substantially completes the reach of our comprehensive portfolio for the lifecycle integration of grid infrastructure across electrical transmission, substation, and distribution assets, and communications towers.
Our relatively numerous and frequent programmatic acquisitions, which most often “fill white space” from within our ecosystem of adjacent smaller companies, add their particular value principally by virtue of our existing platform comprehensiveness, and accordingly we consider this programmatic aspect of our growth as characteristically within our mainstream business performance (unlike platform acquisitions). Our average historical annualized recurring revenues growth rate from programmatic acquisitions over the last five years has been approximately 1.5% measured on a constant currency basis. Examples of recent programmatic acquisitions, along with their purposes, include:
•Citilabs (2019) and Inro (2021), to add traffic simulation software for multi‑modal mobility digital twins;
•OrbitGT (2019), to add specialized capabilities for mobile mapping (such as vehicle‑based scanning and photogrammetry) to our reality modeling offerings;
•GroupBC (2020), to bring additional common data environment solutions for construction projects and infrastructure assets, and federate to iTwin cloud services, extending the value of project and asset information through digital twins;
•Cohesive Solutions (2020), and subsequent complementary programmatic acquisitions, to bring digital integrator expertise for the convergence, through digital twin cloud services, of digital engineering models (ET), with IT and OT, for infrastructure assets in the utilities, energy, and facilities sectors;
•Vista Data Vision (2021), to add intrinsic IoT capabilities for infrastructure digital twins to incorporate real‑time sensor data. By virtue of the resulting “infrastructure IoT” standardization, the full IoT ecosystem becomes seamlessly accessible for IT/OT/ET integration through infrastructure digital twins; and
•SPIDA Software (2021), adds a key element to our grid digital twin solutions, the design, analysis, and management of utility pole systems, which deliver the environmentally vulnerable “last mile” of critical infrastructure for vital energy and communications.
Our Competition
The market for our software solutions is highly competitive and subject to change. We compete against large, global, publicly‑traded companies that have resources greater than our own, and also against small, new, or geographically‑focused firms that specialize in developing niche software offerings. While we do not believe that any competitor offers a portfolio as comprehensive as ours, we do face strong competition, varying by infrastructure lifecycle phase and sector:
•our key competitors in public works/utilities applications include Autodesk, Inc., Trimble Inc., Hexagon AB, and Dassault Systèmes;
•our key competitors in industrial/resources applications include Hexagon AB, AVEVA Group plc, and Dassault Systèmes;
•our key competitors in commercial/facilities applications include Autodesk, Inc., Nemetschek SE, and Trimble Inc.;
•our key competitors in project delivery systems include Autodesk, Inc. and Oracle Corporation with their Primavera P6 and Aconex offerings; and
•our key competitors in asset performance systems include Aspen Technology, Inc., AVEVA Group plc, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., and General Electric Corp.
The principal competitive factors affecting our market include:
•product features, performance, and effectiveness;
•reliability and security;
•product line breadth, depth, and continuity;
•comprehensiveness of offerings across disciplines and infrastructure sectors;
•specification by and endorsement of infrastructure owners, and degree of adoption across the relevant supply chain;
•familiarity and loyalty by professionals throughout their training and careers;
•ability to integrate with other technology;
•capacity to operate at scale;
•capabilities for configurability and APIs;
•ease of use and efficient workflows;
•price, commercial model, and total cost of use;
•support of industry standards;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe we compete favorably against our competitors based on the factors above and that we distinguish ourselves through our comprehensive software portfolio, our commitment to both integration and interoperability across the entire infrastructure lifecycle, our flexible commercial models, and our direct sales channels.
Our Sales and Marketing
We bring our offerings to market primarily through direct sales channels that generated approximately 92% of our 2021 total revenues. Our direct sales channel includes:
•Account Managers, who are responsible for our largest accounts. For pre‑sales technical activities, Account Managers are supported by the engineering domain experts within our User Success organization;
•Inside Sales Specialists, who are responsible for servicing smaller‑ to medium‑sized accounts in territories defined by geography and product lines; and
•Product Sales Specialists, who are technical experts in a specific product line, help to sell across the territories of both Account Managers and Inside Sales Specialists.
We rely on specialist channel partners in geographic regions where we do not currently have a meaningful presence or where, for some of our offerings, direct sales efforts are less economically feasible. Channel partners accounted for approximately 8% of our 2021 total revenues.
Sales cycles for our applications tend to be relatively short, measured in weeks. The most prevalent transactions are increases by accounts in their use of our applications already in use. Our sales model allows and encourages accounts to try usage of our applications that are new to them with minimal obligation. We act upon our logs of such new usage to assign user success colleagues to help the new users in this expanded adoption.
Our ProjectWise and AssetWise enterprise systems offerings are generally sold through either proactive proposals or responses to requests for proposal, so sales cycles for those offerings range from months to several quarters. We have a comprehensive global proposals team to assure appropriate business development resources are allocated, to quality‑assure efficient and effective proposal contents, and to maximize the capture ratio for our proposal pursuit.
Our marketing functions include:
•Corporate marketing, to build brand awareness, brand equity, and thought leadership, including through corporate events and programs covering industry trends and challenges, and to conduct market research and industry studies;
•Industry and product marketing, for demand generation through digital marketing channels, including our website, Internet advertising, webinars, and virtual events, and paid and organic social media, and through traditional marketing channels such as trade print advertising, press releases, editorial placements, industry‑specific trade shows and conferences, in‑person seminars, and locally‑sponsored events; and
•Regional marketing, to localize and deliver our marketing programs throughout the world.
We also invest in our annual Year in Infrastructure Conference, which brings together leading infrastructure thought leaders from around the world for presentations on innovative projects, to learn about the latest advances to our applications and cloud offerings, and to network and share best practices. Our associated Year in Infrastructure and Going Digital Awards, which we held virtually in 2021 due to the COVID‑19 pandemic, attracted nearly 300 project nominations from our accounts to be judged by independent juries in 19 categories for digital advancements in infrastructure engineering.
Our Research and Development
We continue to make substantial investments in research and development because we believe the infrastructure engineering software market presents compelling opportunities for the application of new technologies that advance our current solutions. Our research and development roadmap balances technology advances and new offerings with continuous enhancements to existing offerings. Our allocation of research and development resources is guided by management‑established priorities, input from product managers, and user and sales force feedback.
We had more than 1,600 colleagues engaged globally in software research and development as of December 31, 2021. Each of our product advancement groups for Engineering Applications, Geoprofessional Applications, Enterprise Systems, and Industry Solutions have research and development resources and responsibilities. Our iTwin Services group consists of approximately 180 colleagues and is entirely devoted to the rapid development of new and incremental cloud‑native services for infrastructure digital twins. Our separate Technology office assesses the potential of new software technologies and sources.
As part of our resource allocation process, we also conduct a cost‑benefit analysis of acquiring available technology in the marketplace versus developing our own solutions. Our Portfolio Development office, in addition to pursuing appropriate acquisitions and digital-integrator startups, allocates funding for internal “acceleration” projects, to “make” rather than “buy.” Each such project is staffed with colleagues dedicated to the “intrapreneurial” incubation of a new offering, which is brought back to its respective sponsoring product advancement group after market introduction.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our research and development spending was $220.9 million, $185.5 million, and $183.6 million, respectively, and as a percentage of our total revenues was 22.9%, 23.1%, and 24.9%, respectively.
Digital co-ventures
In 2019, we and Topcon created an equally‑owned joint venture, DCW, to serve as a digital integrator for major construction projects and related enterprises. We and Topcon each contributed experienced colleagues in addition to the required capital commitments.
As part of our co‑venturing with Siemens, we undertake a program of joint research and development investment in which each company bears its own costs. These investments have led to jointly offered cloud services for infrastructure digital twins, some of which are already commercially available.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that the success of our business depends more on the quality of our proprietary software solutions, technology, processes, and domain expertise than on copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. While we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable, we do not believe that our competitive position depends primarily on obtaining legal protection for our software solutions and technology. Instead, we believe that our competitive position depends primarily on our ability to maintain a leadership position by developing innovative proprietary software solutions, technology, information, processes, and know‑how. Nevertheless, we rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in the United States (“U.S.”) and other jurisdictions to secure our intellectual property, and we use contractual provisions and non‑disclosure agreements to protect it. As of December 31, 2021, we had 134 patents granted and 48 patents pending in the U.S., the first of which expires on January 12, 2022, and 25 patents granted and 65 patents pending internationally, the first of which expires on August 14, 2022. In addition, from time to time we enter into collaboration arrangements and in‑bound licensing agreements with third parties, including certain of our competitors, in order to expand the functionality and interoperability of our software solutions. We are not substantially dependent upon any one of these arrangements, and we are not obligated to pay any material royalty or license fees with respect to them.
Our patents cover systems and methods relating to various aspects of software for infrastructure design and modeling, collaboration and work‑sharing, and infrastructure asset operations. Among other things, our patents address a broad range of issues in infrastructure domains from analyzing building energy usage and structural analysis, railway system maintenance, water network design and operation and augmented reality, as well as techniques for creating, storing, displaying, and processing infrastructure models.
To innovate and increase our strategic position, our software developers are incentivized to alert our internal patent committee to innovations that might be patentable or of strategic value. In 2021, our patent committee reviewed 21 invention disclosures submitted by our software developers, and filed 17 U.S. and 14 foreign patent applications, while 17 U.S. and no foreign patents were granted. We also plan to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for aspects of our technology and solutions that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. We have registered 173 trademarks, including “Bentley,” “MicroStation,” “AssetWise,” and “ProjectWise,” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the U.S.
Our names, logos, website names, and addresses are owned by us or licensed by us. This Annual Report on Form 10‑K contains trademarks, trade names, and service marks of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K may appear without the ®, TM, or SM symbols, but the lack of those references is not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks, trade names, and service marks. We do not intend our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade names, or service marks to imply, and such use or display should not be construed to imply, endorsement or sponsorship of us by these other parties.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)
At Bentley Systems, our commitment to ESG is driven by our service to engineering and related professions, and the positive impacts our products enable through the design, building, and operation of the world’s infrastructure. In 2021, we enhanced our ESG efforts and improved our performance, particularly in the areas of governance, strategy, and disclosure.
ESG Governance
In our first year as a public company, our primary objective was to establish strong ESG governance. In early 2021, we established formal Board oversight of ESG through the newly created Sustainability Committee of our board of directors. The Sustainability Committee, a committee of independent Bentley Systems directors, meets quarterly to assess the Company’s ESG performance, strategy, and disclosures. In addition, we enhanced internal governance of ESG through the formation of the internal ESG Steering Committee. The ESG Steering Committee meets regularly and consists of Bentley Systems executive sponsors from relevant functional departments and other subject matter experts with responsibilities for ESG strategy, implementation, and reporting.
ESG Strategy
To define our approach to ESG and our areas of focus, we reviewed the leading ESG reporting frameworks and engaged our ESG Steering Committee to develop our ESG Framework. Using the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board Software and IT Services Standard and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we identified nine areas of focus that align with our E, S, and G pillars. These areas are where we believe Bentley Systems can best create value and mitigate potential risks. Building from this initial framework, we seek to articulate our current performance in each area, develop strategies to manage these areas over time, and engage stakeholders to refine this framework following the ESG principles of materiality.
ESG Disclosure
As a first step to enhancing our ESG reporting, we developed an ESG website to centralize our relevant disclosures and to prepare for future reporting. The website details our ESG Framework, current ESG efforts, and numerous resources linked in the ESG Data Center.
To learn more, visit our ESG website at www.bentley.com/en/esg.
Human Capital Management
We consider our colleagues a key success factor in driving our continued growth. Our overall Talent Strategy focuses on building an inclusive and engaging culture in which our colleagues develop, collaborate, contribute, and thrive, so they can make a difference through advancing the world’s infrastructure.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,626 full‑time colleagues globally, including 1,860 in the Americas (the U.S., Canada, and Latin America (including the Caribbean)), 1,231 in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and 1,535 in Asia‑Pacific (“APAC”). None of our full‑time U.S. colleagues are unionized. Outside the U.S., a small overall portion of our colleagues in certain countries are represented by a colleague representative organization, such as a union or colleague association. Our colleagues bring 67 languages to fulfill the needs of our globally dispersed accounts and users. Our colleagues are highly qualified with an average of six years of total service with the Company and advanced academic credentials, including 124 doctoral degrees and 1,264 master’s‑level degrees.
We believe our culture and values are a key driver for attracting, developing, and retaining highly talented colleagues. Our culture and values are rooted in the philosophy of corporate responsibility and ESG, which drive workforce motivation to make an impact on the world’s infrastructure and improve quality of life, a passion to solve our users’ challenging problems through innovation and creativity, a desire to connect and collaborate, and a commitment to deliver on our promises.
Our approach to talent management is guided by our strong sense of corporate culture. We do this by striving to remain competitive with our peers and to embed opportunity, engagement, diversity, inclusion, and continuous growth throughout the entire lifecycle of talent management.
Talent Acquisition Strategy
Our Talent Acquisition Strategy leverages best practices to attract, engage, and hire diverse people and current and future leaders who will work hand‑in‑hand with all colleagues to achieve success. Thanks to our culture and values, investment in colleague development opportunities, and competitive total rewards, we enjoy high levels of colleague referrals to supplement our corporate hiring practices, which are encouraged through our colleague referral program. We also build relationships with universities around the world as part of our Future Talent Program to hire talented graduates into our rotational Graduate Development Program, which provides curated growth and development opportunities while creating a solid talent pipeline for our critical business units and teams.
As part of our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”), we deploy strategies to identify diverse candidates with each open position, take measures to keep our Talent Acquisition process free of bias, and in the U.S., we intentionally partner and advertise jobs with organizations focused on women, veterans, people of color, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ populations. As part of our university efforts, we partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (“HBCUs”) in the U.S. and provide free Bentley Systems software learning licenses to HBCU students. We have also expanded our reach to students in our local communities via partnerships with organizations like CodePath, a non-profit organization striving to eliminate educational inequity in technical education.
Professional Development
We are committed to investing in our most valuable resource, our colleagues. We provide our colleagues with various tools and opportunities to enhance their professional development and, as a result, the career potential of each colleague.

Engagement and Performance Management
Colleague engagement is critical to maintaining our strong sense of corporate culture. We conduct annual talent reviews and engagement surveys to ensure that we are executing business objectives, providing resources to optimize the performance and potential of our colleagues, and to ensure our colleagues are motivated and engaged.
In our 2021 Annual Colleague Engagement Survey, we were pleased to report an 86% participation rate across the organization despite the challenges of remote work. Of the colleagues who participated in the survey, 85% responded they were proud to work for Bentley Systems and 87% responded they would gladly recommend Bentley Systems as a place to work to people they know and respect.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
As a global company with colleagues of different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives based in more than 40 countries worldwide, our diversity is what makes us successful. Bentley Systems is committed to fostering and continuing to build programs to promote DEI so that all colleagues can reach their highest performance and potential. We have developed strategies and programs focused on DEI and increasing diversity and equity, as well as fostering a culture of inclusion and well‑being in the workplace. These strategies and programs include:
•Building Diversity. We are building a pipeline of diverse candidates by recruiting and partnering in education programs at HBCUs. We are partnering with professional organizations to support underrepresented groups in engineering and technology. We provide internships; scholarships; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) grants; mentorships; and programmatic support to organizations and schools with diverse and underrepresented groups. We implemented pre-hire assessments to reduce implicit bias in the hiring process;
•Colleagues. We continue to create an inclusive workplace through our colleague resource groups, the Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Alliance (“IDEA”), which provides our colleagues a platform to join other colleagues from all regions, levels, demographics, and departments to build community and celebrate our diversity and differences. IDEA currently has four global focus groups: Bentley Pride, Open Abilities, People of Color in the U.S., and Women at Bentley. Our IDEA groups have built community and provided platforms for discussion by hosting book clubs, panel discussion, speakers, and celebrating global awareness days and events. We also invest in the Bentley Network of Women (NOW), a development and mentoring program for women globally at the Director level and below; and
•Awareness and Training. We have implemented robust DEI training as part of our annual compliance commitments. We have held interactive sessions with our executives, emerging leaders, and talent acquisition in fostering DEI and eliminating unconscious bias, and have implemented training for hiring managers to ensure fairness in the interview process.
In the U.S., we have provided extended paid parental leave and benefits for qualified gender affirming surgery. We plan to continue our commitments to gender pay parity and analysis and benefits to ensure our colleague’s well‑being.
Additional information on our DEI program can be found on our website at www.bentley.com/en/about-us/diversity-equity-inclusion.
COVID-19 Response
From the start of the COVID‑19 pandemic, we took immediate action to ensure our colleagues had the equipment and resources they needed to work from home, which also enabled success for our users. Our global task force provided continuous communication, education, and support services to our colleagues. Their well‑being fueled our response plan and we created learning resources to support them throughout the pandemic. These learning resources included guides and practices for managers to lead virtually with empathy, tips for maintaining team collaboration, and resources and support for colleagues to maintain a healthy work‑life balance. We are proud to share that at no point during the COVID‑19 pandemic have we had to resort to furloughs.
As the pandemic continues, and work flexibility is seen as the key to success for our business and colleagues’ well‑being, we created the Infrastructure Empowered Workforce Plan (the “IEWP”) in July 2021. The principle of the IEWP is for colleagues to take advantage of the world’s infrastructure through mobility, productive and enjoyable facilities, and the flexibility to work remotely, all while leveraging the power of technology. The IEWP encourages our colleagues to make the best of both remote and in‑office working worlds to perform at a high level in contributing to our company’s success— and accordingly to the world’s economy and environment, which depends on infrastructure.
The IEWP is built on a solid foundation of trust, empowering colleagues to make responsible and effective choices about the right balance between working from the office and remotely. This plan does not require colleagues to come into the office at any specific frequency. Rather, it provides colleagues the flexibility to make these choices with their manager and within their teams, to achieve business success and maintain a high level of productivity and engagement.
From the IEWP survey conducted in September 2021, 85% of our colleagues who participated in the survey responded that they believed the IEWP will positively contribute to their work‑life balance and 78% responded that the IEWP will positively impact their productivity and effectiveness at work.
