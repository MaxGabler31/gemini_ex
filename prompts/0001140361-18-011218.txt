Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize novel, hospital-based therapies capable of transforming treatment paradigms in the management of acute, life-threatening neurological and other conditions. Our initial product candidates target rare, acute, life-threatening neurological and other conditions for which we believe the approved existing therapies, if any, are inadequate.
 
We believe EG-1962, our lead product candidate, can fundamentally improve patient outcomes and transform the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or aSAH, which is bleeding around the brain due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. A single dose of EG-1962 delivers high concentrations of nimodipine, the current standard of care, directly to the brain with sustained drug exposure over 21 days. EG-1962 utilizes our proprietary, programmable, biodegradable polymer-based development platform, or our PrecisaTM development platform, through a novel delivery mechanism that enables targeted and sustained drug exposure while potentially avoiding dose-limiting side effects associated with currently available formulations of nimodipine.  EG-1962 has been granted orphan drug designation and Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or SAH. The European Commission has granted orphan drug designation to EG-1962 for treatment of aSAH.
 
In July 2016 we commenced the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study for EG-1962.  NEWTON 2 is a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of EG-1962 to standard of care oral nimodipine in adults with an aSAH.  The primary endpoint of the NEWTON 2 study is the proportion of subjects with a favorable clinical outcome (a score of 6 – 8 on the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, or GOSE) at day 90.  The secondary endpoint is the subject’s score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale, or MoCA.  On December 29, 2017, we announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, recommended that the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 continue as planned, based on the completion of a pre-planned futility analysis. The DMC made this recommendation after evaluating data from the Day 90 follow-up visit of the first 150 patients randomized and treated, as well as the available safety data in the study. A pre-planned interim analysis will be performed following the 90 day outcome assessment of the 210th patient. We expect to complete the interim analysis by the end of  April 2018 with an announcement of the results to follow.  Unless the results of the interim analysis are overwhelmingly positive, which we believe will be hard to achieve, the NEWTON 2 study is expected to continue to full data readout, in which case we expect the results of the study to be available in late 2018. The final results of the NEWTON 2 study, if positive, could form the basis for a marketing application to the FDA and other global health regulatory authorities for the approval of EG-1962 for the treatment of aSAH.  In the United States, we plan to use the regulatory pathway set forth in Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act.
 
Our Phase 1/2 clinical study of EG-1962, which we refer to as our NEWTON study, met its primary and secondary endpoints of safety, tolerability, defining the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and pharmacokinetics. The results of the principal exploratory efficacy endpoint from the 90-day follow-up demonstrated that 59% (27 of 46) of patients treated with EG-1962 experienced a favorable clinical outcome (a GOSE score of 6-8) versus 28% (5 of 18) of patients treated with the standard of care oral nimodipine. At the final assessment, of the 46 patients treated with EG-1962, 28% (13 of 46) of patients achieved the highest clinical outcome score (GOSE=8, Upper Good Recovery) versus 6% (1 of 18) patients treated with the standard of care oral nimodipine.
 
A Phase 1 study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes of EG-1962 administered intracisternally, or directly into the basal cisterns of the brain, is open for enrollment for patients with aSAH who do not receive an external ventricular drain, or EVD, but remain at risk for delayed neurological complications following surgical repair of a ruptured aneurysm. This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study in which nine patients are expected to receive EG-1962 via intracisternal administration and three patients are expected to receive standard of care oral nimodipine.
 
In the United States, approximately 35,000 patients with an average age of 52 experience an SAH each year.  Of these, approximately 20,000 experience an aSAH and are hospitalized in the intensive care unit, or ICU, and approximately 75% of these patients suffer permanent brain damage or die within 30 days.  Care for these patients results in overall inpatient charges of more than $5.0 billion per year in the United States. After the ruptured aneurysm is repaired, these patients remain at risk for multiple complications that are managed over the course of the patient’s treatment to optimize clinical outcomes. The most common and severe complications, which are thought to be at least in part due to the influx of calcium, include cerebral vasospasm, or narrowing of the brain arteries, and delayed cerebral ischemia, or DCI, a catastrophic delayed complication that occurs secondary to processes including cerebral vasospasm. DCI occurs in up to 30% of patients who survive the initial hemorrhage. DCI often leads to the death of brain tissue due to insufficient blood flow to certain areas of the brain and results in a significant economic burden to the health care system. The direct cost to hospitals in patients experiencing DCI is estimated to be approximately $50,000 in additional direct in-hospital per patient costs, but can increase to $70,000 based on the additional comorbidities associated with treating an aSAH patient and the extent of their disability. An analysis of the 2013 National Inpatient Sample Database showed that the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients who require an EVD, and undergo either neurosurgical micro clipping or endovascular coiling for repair of their aneurysm, had the highest per-patient hospital charges, exceeding $400,000 per patient, and experienced the longest hospitalizations of all aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.  Not included in this analysis are the additional costs of rehabilitation, the long-term lifetime cost of illness related to an aSAH, the frequent inability to re-enter the work force, and the potential need for additional care at home from family members or long term care givers associated with chronically disabled patients, which present additional significant economic burden to the healthcare system and the families of those afflicted with aSAH.

In most countries, including the United States, current treatment guidelines recommend that all aSAH patients receive the L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine over a 21-day period orally every four hours. In certain geographies outside the United States, the product can also be received via IV administration. As part of their routine course of treatment, we believe nearly half of aSAH patients have an EVD inserted into the brain to monitor and relieve intracranial pressure by draining out cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF.  The EVD can also serve as a pathway to administer drugs. Nimodipine has been the standard of care for over 25 years and has a well-understood safety profile at its approved dose and route of administration. Nimodipine has been shown to improve outcomes in aSAH patients, and its mechanism of action is believed to modify several calcium channel mediated pathways that contribute to unfavorable outcomes.
 
However, the ability to administer nimodipine systemically at optimal therapeutic levels may be limited by side effects, primarily its potential to cause hypotension, or low blood pressure, which can exacerbate the complications of aSAH. EG-1962 is being investigated to deliver high and sustained concentrations of nimodipine directly to the site of injury in the brain in a single administration through an existing EVD, while potentially avoiding the dose-limiting side effects of oral nimodipine. Since current treatment guidelines recommend that all patients receive nimodipine prophylactically after aSAH, we believe that EG-1962, if approved, can become the new standard of care for all patients who receive an EVD after aSAH.
 
Our NEWTON study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical study of EG-1962. It was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, MTD and pharmacokinetics of EG-1962 compared to the standard of care oral nimodipine in up to 96 patients with aSAH. Six different dose cohorts (72 patients) were evaluated in North America at escalating doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg, and one patient, who received EG-1962, was evaluated outside of North America. Twelve patients in each cohort were randomized in a ratio of 3 to 1 to receive either single dose EG-1962 or standard of care oral nimodipine for 21 days. After 90 days, multiple exploratory endpoints were evaluated, the principal exploratory endpoint of which was patient clinical outcomes; other exploratory endpoints included occurrence of DCI, use of rescue therapies and ICU and hospital length of stay, or LOS, all of which we believe are indicative of the potential efficacy of EG-1962. Seventeen medical centers in North America and one medical center in Finland randomized patients into the study.
 
The NEWTON results showed that the primary and secondary study endpoints were met and all of the exploratory endpoints favored the EG-1962 groups when compared to the standard of care oral nimodipine. Safety and tolerability data were reported for all  cohorts, while efficacy results were reported only for subjects treated with doses of EG-1962 up to and including 800 mg, as 1200 mg was not a tolerable dose. There were no safety concerns identified after administration of EG-1962 that precluded dose escalation. The number of deaths and serious adverse events in the EG-1962 treated group were comparable to those in the standard of care oral nimodipine group. Further, 0% of patients (0 of 55) experienced EG-1962-related hypotension in the treated group, while 17% of patients (3 of 18) experienced standard of care oral nimodipine related hypotension. The MTD was determined to be 800 mg, with the 600 mg dose considered to be the optimal dose to evaluate in the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study.
 
Since at least 50% of aSAH patients may not require an EVD, market expansion opportunities exist. We intend to explore alternative routes of administration of EG-1962, as evidenced by the commencement of our study of intracisternal administration of EG-1962 in patients with aSAH who do not receive an EVD. Additionally, physicians have expressed interest in the use of an EVD in patients who do not routinely receive one as standard of care solely to administer EG-1962 in patients at high risk of delayed neurological complications.
 
In addition to EG-1962, we are using our Precisa PlatformTM to seek to develop additional product candidates targeting other acute, serious conditions where limited or no current approved therapies exist. We are developing EG-1964 as a prophylactic treatment in the management of chronic subdural hematoma, or cSDH, to prevent recurrent bleeding on the surface of the brain. A cSDH is a liquefied hematoma that has accumulated on the surface of the brain in an area referred to as the subdural space and is often caused by minor head trauma.  We are also developing EG-1965, for the prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation, or POAF. By way of a single administration at the time of the surgical intervention, we believe EG-1965 can deliver an effective concentration of drug directly to the atrial myocardium with sustained drug exposure for up to seven days.
 
Our current product development strategy involves identifying hospital-based products for other acute, life-threatening conditions where limited or no current therapies exist. We then apply our scientific, clinical, and technical expertise to design targeted, small or large molecule therapeutics. Our Precisa platform allows us to create polymer-based therapeutics, designed to be capable of delivering medicines directly to the site of injury to potentially avoid serious systemic side effects often associated with oral or intravenous delivery approaches and to potentially enable high and sustained drug exposure with only a single dose at the initial time of procedural or surgical intervention. Our approach is not expected to require a material change in physician behavior and may result in significant pharmacoeconomic advantages, as it seeks to avoid recurrent invasive procedures, mitigate clinical complications that often result in prolonged and expensive acute hospital care, and improve patient outcomes, which could potentially decrease the likelihood of costly long-term, skilled nursing care. While we have initially applied our approach to acute neurological and cardiological conditions, we intend to apply our Precisa development platform to seek to develop treatments for other acute, serious conditions by targeting other organs across additional therapeutic areas, including possibly trauma and other diseases.

We currently retain worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. If we receive marketing authorization for our products, we intend to establish targeted commercialization and marketing capabilities for our products in the United States, Canada and possibly the EU.  In the United States and Canada, approximately 300 top academic medical centers treat approximately 90% of all aSAH patients. As such, we believe a small, targeted sales force could effectively cover these institutions and successfully commercialize our products, if approved. In the United States, we intend to commercialize by developing a hospital sales force of up to 50 representatives that would focus on academic medical centers and other major medical centers treating acute neurological conditions.  We believe a similar sized sales force would be appropriate for the EU, should we decide to commercialize EG-1962 there using an Edge sales force.  For commercialization of our products, if approved, outside of the United States and Canada, we may enter into collaborations or license agreements with strategic partners.
 
We are led by a team of executives and directors with significant experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization. Our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Brian A. Leuthner, has been responsible for developing, launching and selling products in the hospital market for GlaxoWellcome plc, Johnson & Johnson, ESP Pharma, Inc. and The Medicines Company. Our other co- founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. R. Loch Macdonald, is a world-renowned neurosurgeon and expert in the research and management of acute neurological and neurosurgical conditions. Other members of our management team have held senior positions at Abbott Laboratories, Alpharma, Inc., Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Celgene Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, Endo International plc, ESP Pharma, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Lundbeck, Medarex, Inc., MedPointe, Inc., NPS Pharmaceuticals, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, PTC Therapeutics, Purdue Pharma L.P., Schering Plough Corporation, Shire Pharmaceuticals, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  In addition, our Chairman of the Board, Dr. Sol Barer, is the former Chairman and CEO of Celgene Corporation and the current Chairman of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board, Dr. Robert Langer, is a world-renowned scientist and pioneer in drug-delivery-related inventions.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our vision is to become a leading global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes novel, hospital-based therapies capable of transforming treatment paradigms in the management of acute, life-threatening medical conditions. We intend to utilize our product development and commercial execution strategies to achieve this vision. Key elements of our execution strategy are as follows:

• | Rapidly develop our lead product candidate, EG-1962 to improve clinical outcomes following an aSAH. We completed the NEWTON study, enrolling 72 patients in six different dose cohorts in North America with doses ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg, and one patient outside of North America who received EG-1962 600 mg. During 2016, we initiated NEWTON 2, our pivotal Phase 3 study in the United States, Canada and Israel. In 2017, we expanded the study globally to additional centers across North America, Europe, and Australasia. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the development of EG-1962 for alternative routes of administration to improve clinical outcomes following an aSAH. In order to deliver EG-1962 to aSAH patients that do not receive an EVD as standard of care, we have an ongoing Phase 1 study of EG-1962 administered directly into the basal cisterns. We are also exploring a lumbar route of administration for EG-1962. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate other indications for EG-1962 in therapeutic areas inside and outside of the brain. Published literature indicates that L-type calcium channel blockers have a broad range of potential uses in other therapeutic areas. By using our proprietary Precisa platform to enable site specific sustained delivery of nimodipine to a target organ, we believe that EG-1962 may demonstrate improvements in safety and/or efficacy profiles in these other therapeutic areas over existing standards of care.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue development of EG-1965 for the prevention of POAF. In 2018, we intend to complete formulation development and initiate pharmacology and toxicology studies required for filing an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. Pending results of those studies, we may submit an IND in 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize our product candidates, including EG-1962, if approved, through a targeted sales force in the United States and Canada and possibly Europe, and with potential strategic partnerships outside of the regions where we field our own sales force. We have retained the worldwide rights to all of our product candidates and intend to build a hospital-focused sales organization to market our approved products. We intend to establish targeted sales forces in the United States and Canada, and possibly Europe, for EG-1962, if approved, to sell into medical centers capable of treating acute neurological conditions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Leverage our proprietary, programmable, polymer-based Precisa platform to seek to develop life-saving therapies in acute care areas. We intend to expand the use of our Precisa development platform in other therapeutic areas, such as cardiac surgery or neuro-oncology. Depending on the specific needs of the targeted therapy, these initiatives may focus on applying our Precisa development platform to previously approved medicines, or may result from the collaboration on, or in-licensing and development of, new chemical entities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify business development or product acquisition opportunities that leverage our core expertise. We intend to identify assets that we might in-license or acquire that utilize our expertise in developing and manufacturing drugs for acute, hospital-based or other conditions, complement our efforts and activities in potentially commercializing EG-1962 in the hospital setting, and leverage the infrastructure developed to potentially bring EG-1962 and other products into the clinic and to the marketplace. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to seek to maintain high barriers to entry around our product candidates and the markets in which they are utilized by using a multi-layered approach. One layer of defense relates to obtaining regulatory exclusivity, such as orphan drug protection, when and where available. An additional layer relates to patent rights. We currently have five issued U.S. patents, including composition of matter related to EG-1962, 35 granted foreign patents, four notices of acceptance/eligibility for grant/allowance of foreign applications, and more than 70 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications. Another layer of defense involves technical operations and manufacturing know-how and trade secrets relating to the design and manufacture of products using our Precisa development platform. An additional layer involves the difficulty a competitor may experience in proving bioequivalence. If a competitor were to attempt to prove bioequivalence, we believe such competitor would likely be required to conduct human clinical studies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Product Candidates
 
EG-1962 for aSAH
 
EG-1962, a polymer-based microparticle containing nimodipine suspended in a diluent of sodium hyaluronate was developed using our Precisa development platform to improve patient outcomes following aSAH. Nimodipine, delivered via oral or intravenous routes of administration, is currently the standard of care for the management of aSAH and is believed to work by modifying several pathways contributing to unfavorable outcomes. Current U.S. treatment guidelines recommend that all aSAH patients, commencing within 96 hours after aneurysm rupture, receive nimodipine orally every four hours over a 21-day period. However, the ability to achieve optimal therapeutic levels of nimodipine when administered orally or intravenously may be limited by serious side effects, primarily hypotension, which can exacerbate the complications of aSAH. We believe that a single intraventricular dose of EG-1962 has the potential to improve patient outcomes by delivering high and sustained concentrations of nimodipine over a 21-day period directly to the brain, while avoiding these dose-limiting side effects.
 
Background on aSAH
 
An aSAH is a brain hemorrhage after which blood from a ruptured aneurysm enters the subarachnoid space, the area between the middle and deepest protective layers of the brain. The World Health Organization and published medical literature estimates that approximately 600,000 individuals worldwide suffer an aSAH each year.  In the United States, approximately 35,000 patients with an average age of 52 experience an SAH each year.  Of these, approximately 20,000 experience an aSAH and are hospitalized in ICU, and approximately 75% of these patients suffer permanent brain damage and die within 30 days.  Patients with an aSAH typically present with a characteristic intense, unrelenting and overwhelming headache of sudden onset. After a computed tomography, or CT, scan is performed upon arrival at the hospital, the aneurysm is repaired to prevent rebleeding, and the patient is sent to the ICU for close monitoring over a 14 to 21 day period. An EVD is placed into the fluid chambers of the brain to measure and manage intracranial pressure in what we believe to be approximately 50% of all aSAH patients. These EVDs may also serve as routes of administration for drugs, including EG-1962, if approved.
 
After the ruptured aneurysm is repaired, patients remain at risk for multiple complications that are managed over the course of the patient’s treatment to optimize clinical outcomes. DCI is a common and serious complication following aSAH that typically occurs within three to 14 days after aneurysm rupture and is believed to be caused by cerebral vasospasm and other mechanisms. DCI occurs in up to 30% of the patients that survive the initial hemorrhage. Clinical features of DCI after aSAH mostly consist of focal neurological deficits, or a decrease in the level of consciousness, the time of onset and severity of which vary. DCI is sometimes reversible, but may also progress to death of brain tissue resulting in severe disability or death. It is thought that DCI and vasospasm are at least in part caused by the influx of calcium. When vasospasm and DCI occur after aSAH, rescue therapy is initiated and is comprised of hemodynamic management, which typically involves giving medicine to increase a patient’s blood pressure to try to push more blood and oxygen into the brain, and performing angioplasty, which involves injecting drugs directly into brain arteries to dilate such arteries or inflating small balloons into the narrowed arteries to open them. To date, the L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine is the only drug approved in North America and Europe shown to have efficacy in reducing unfavorable clinical outcomes and neurological deficits after aSAH. However, given the limitations of oral nimodipine, better pharmacological treatments are needed to improve patient outcomes.

The pictures below illustrate the typical sequence of events for the up to 30% of aSAH patients who experience DCI.
 

If these complications cannot be reversed during rescue therapy and DCI is not prevented, death of brain tissue results and can lead to permanent brain damage resulting in disability or death.
 
Current Standard of Care for aSAH
 
Current treatment guidelines recommend that all patients with an aSAH should be administered oral or, in Europe, intravenous nimodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker which is believed to block several pathways that contribute to unfavorable outcomes. The FDA approved nimodipine in the oral form of gelatin capsules, or gelcaps as Nimotop® in 1988. In 2013, the FDA approved Nymalize®, an oral solution of nimodipine, and granted it marketing exclusivity as a result of its orphan drug designation. Nymalize has received regulatory approval only in the United States. While not approved for intravenous administration in the United States, nimodipine is currently available in oral gelcaps, oral tablets and/or intravenous forms in almost every country. Due to a lack of alternative therapies, nimodipine rapidly became standard of care and was incorporated into treatment guidelines for aSAH. Nimodipine is indicated to improve neurological outcomes by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits following aSAH. In a meta-analysis of clinical studies, oral nimodipine demonstrated an approximately 11% absolute risk reduction in unfavorable outcomes as compared to placebo.
 
After an aSAH, nimodipine is prescribed to be given over a 21-day course of treatment administered orally every four hours or intravenously for about seven days followed by 14 days of oral nimodipine.  However, dosages of nimodipine delivered orally or intravenously may be limited because nimodipine is non-selective and dilates not only brain arteries, but other arteries throughout the rest of the body. Arterial dilation can cause adverse effects, such as hypotension, and by reducing blood flow to the already-injured brain, can exacerbate the complications of aSAH. Therefore, we believe a significant need remains for a better, commercially viable method of providing higher and more sustained concentrations of nimodipine at the site of brain injury without the potential to cause serious systemic side effects, primarily hypotension, associated with current formulations of nimodipine.
 
Our Solution: EG-1962
 
EG-1962 is a novel, proprietary formulation consisting of nimodipine encapsulated within a bioresorbable poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide, or PLGA, matrix and reconstituted with a sodium hyaluronate based buffer making a suspension that releases nimodipine over at least 21 days.  The drug is administered directly into a cerebral ventricle in patients who have suffered in aSAH via an EVD that is in place as standard of care.
 
We believe this targeted approach enables EG-1962 to deliver high and sustained therapeutic concentrations of nimodipine directly to the brain while maintaining relatively low systemic nimodipine levels, thus providing for the potential to improve patient outcomes and avoid the serious side effects, primarily hypotension, associated with oral or intravenous nimodipine. If approved, it is anticipated that EG-1962 will be administered in the ICU typically by the neurosurgeon or neurointensivist via an EVD after the patient has been stabilized following an aSAH. EG-1962 is designed to release an initial dose of the nimodipine to quickly increase concentrations at the site of brain injury prior to the onset of any complications and then to release a steady dose of nimodipine over 21 days. If approved, we believe EG-1962 has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need and can become the standard of care for treatment of aSAH in patients who receive an EVD.

Clinical Studies
 
NEWTON 2
 
In July 2016, we initiated the NEWTON 2 study, a pivotal Phase 3 multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of EG-1962 to standard of care oral nimodipine in adults with an aSAH.  Patients in the EG-1962 treatment arm receive a single 600 mg dose of EG-1962 plus placebo gelcaps or tablets administered for up to 21 days.  Patients in the control arm of the study receive a single dose of intraventricular normal saline and up to 21 days of oral nimodipine gelcaps or tablets.  The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome of 6 – 8 as measured on the GOSE 90 days after aSAH.  Additional outcome measures are neurocognitive outcome at day 90 measured by MoCA, safety (including delayed cerebral infarction at day 30) and health economic endpoints.
 
The NEWTON 2 study will assess up to 374 patients who will be randomized on a one to one basis within 48 hours of their aSAH to either the EG-1962 arm, or the control arm.  On December 29, 2017, we announced that the DMC recommended that the NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 continue as planned based on the completion of a pre-planned futility analysis. The DMC made this recommendation after evaluating data from the 90 day follow-up visit of the first 150 patients randomized and treated, as well as the available safety data in the study. We expect to complete the NEWTON 2 interim analysis by the end of  April 2018 with an announcement of the results of this analysis to follow.  Upon completion of this interim analysis, the DMC may recommend continuing enrollment of the study up to 374 completed patients; ending the study early, as efficacy will have been established at a highly statistically significant level at the time of such interim analysis; or discontinuing enrollment of additional patients, but analyzing all currently enrolled and completed patients.  We believe the likelihood that the DMC will recommend that we end the study early based on highly positive statistical significance is extremely low.  There is no formal futility analysis built into the interim analysis. However, as per the DMC charter, the DMC may recommend amending or terminating the NEWTON 2 study for safety concerns or based on a benefit : risk assessment that does not justify additional subject enrollment.

The figure below provides an overview of the study design for each patient in the NEWTON 2 study:
 

The primary enrollment criteria for the NEWTON 2 study are similar to the ones used in the NEWTON study and are based primarily on the patients’ level of consciousness as measured by the World Federation of Neurological Surgeon’s scale, or WFNS scale. The WFNS scale stratifies patients into grades 1 – 5 with a score of 1 being the highest (or normal) level of consciousness, and a score of 5 being the least conscious. It is believed the level of consciousness is the best prognostic indicator of clinical outcome after aSAH. Patients in the NEWTON 2 study are enrolled if their WFNS score is between 2 and 4. The table below illustrates the WFNS scale:
 

The primary clinical outcome endpoint used to assess patients at 90 days in the NEWTON 2 study is the GOSE. The GOSE is a widely used scale accepted by regulatory agencies as a study endpoint that was developed from the Glasgow Outcome Scale, or GOS, to define broad outcome categories for people who sustain traumatic and non-traumatic brain injuries. GOS is a global scale that rates patient status into one of five categories: Dead, Vegetative State, Severe Disability, Moderate Disability and Good Recovery. The scale focuses on how the injury has affected functioning in major areas of life rather than on specific neurological deficits and symptoms caused by the injury. The GOSE is an expansion of the GOS that refines the clinical outcome assessments for severe disability, moderate disability and good recovery into upper and lower categories thereby creating an eight-point scale as follows:

 Index

In the NEWTON 2 study, the GOSE is rated by an independent assessor who conducts an interview with the patient and/or caregiver from a standardized questionnaire. The NEWTON 2 protocol defines a “favorable outcome” for the clinical outcome as a GOSE score of 6-8 measured at 90 days.
 
NEWTON Study
 
Our NEWTON study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label Phase 1/2 study of EG-1962 compared to the standard of care oral nimodipine. Of the total of 73 patients enrolled in the NEWTON study, 55 patients were randomized to EG-1962 and 18 patients were randomized to oral nimodipine.
 
The primary objectives of the study were to determine the MTD safety and tolerability of a single intraventricular administration of EG-1962. The key secondary objective was to determine pharmacokinetics of EG-1962. Clinical outcomes at day 90, including angiographic vasospasm, and DCI represented important exploratory clinical endpoints, along with ICU and hospital LOS. The primary clinical outcome scale utilized was the GOSE. A score of 6 – 8 on the GOSE scale was considered a favorable outcome. This requires that patients are able to look after themselves and return to work, among other criteria.
 
Subjects were randomized 3 to 1 to receive either a single dose EG-1962 or standard of care oral nimodipine. Six dose-levels (100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg) were evaluated. The active control was the standard of care, oral nimodipine. The active control group received 60 mg of oral nimodipine, which was administered every four hours for a total daily dose of 360 mg for 21 days in accordance with the currently approved dosing regimen. This dose of oral nimodipine remained unchanged except when it was medically warranted to reduce the dose due to adverse events consistent with the standard of care.
 
The figure below provides an overview of the study design for each patient:


NEWTON Clinical Results
 
The primary endpoints of the NEWTON study of safety, tolerability and MTD were all achieved, as were the secondary endpoint of characterizing the pharmacokinetics of EG-1962. Further, all exploratory endpoints favored EG-1962.
 
EG-1962 was well-tolerated with only one EG-1962-related serious adverse event reported, a possible allergic reaction in one patient following administration of EG-1962, which was immediately treated and resolved with no further clinical impact. This patient had a favorable clinical outcome.  No patients (0 of 55) experienced EG-1962 related hypotension in the treated group, while 17% (3 of 18) of patients experienced oral nimodipine related hypotension.
 
The pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that a single, intraventricular administration of EG-1962 provides high CSF levels of nimodipine with plasma levels that do not exceed those associated with systemic hypotension.  The mean maximum levels of nimodipine seen in the plasma ranged between 8.8 ng/mL (100 mg dose), and 25.4 ng/mL (800 mg dose), respectively. This compares to mean maximum levels of 46.2 ng/mL seen in the standard of care oral nimodipine patients.  In a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, hypotension did not occur until plasma nimodipine concentration was greater than approximately 30 to 45 ng/mL.
 
We believe the pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that the high CSF concentrations of nimodipine achieved with EG-1962 allow for more effective inhibition of calcium channels located on the smooth muscle cells within the walls of blood vessels. Nimodipine circulating in the plasma inside the blood vessel is able to access the calcium channels by crossing the blood brain barrier into the smooth muscle cells, while nimodipine circulating in the CSF is able to access the smooth muscle cells from the outer wall of the blood vessel. Once on the smooth muscle cells, nimodipine is believed to act locally on harmful calcium-dependent mechanisms that may contribute to delayed neurological complications. We believe that because EG-1962 provides consistent steady-state plasma concentrations below those known to cause hypotension, the dual-access of EG-1962 on the calcium channels may contribute to favorable patient outcomes.

The pooled exploratory clinical results showed that 59% (27 of 46) of patients treated with EG-1962 achieved a favorable outcome (GOSE scores of 6-8) at 90 days compared to only 28% (5 of 18) in the active control standard of care oral nimodipine arm.
 

The EG-1962 results compared favorably to both those of the standard of care oral nimodipine arm and to published historical data from other contemporary studies of severe aSAH patients treated with the current standard of care, which showed that only 17% (26 of 151) of such patients had favorable outcomes after 90 days (defined as GOSE scores of 6-8). In addition, 28% (13 of 46) of patients treated with EG-1962 in the NEWTON study achieved a GOSE score of 8 (Upper Good Recovery), compared to only 6% (1 of 18) in the standard of care, oral nimodipine arm and less than 1% (1 of 151) in published historical data. This historical data, published in the journal “Neurocritical Care” on February 13, 2015, consisted of 151 patients who had WFNS scores of 2-4 with an EVD and outcomes measured by GOSE, which closely match the enrollment and evaluation criteria for the NEWTON study.
 
Additionally, the clinical outcome results were analyzed by WFNS score to compare rates of favorable outcome by WFNS grade to oral nimodipine standard of care controls. In the analysis by WFNS score, EG-1962 showed more than twice the rate of favorable outcome for WFNS grade 2 patients versus oral nimodipine (89% vs 40%).  For WFNS 4 grade patients, the rate of favorable outcomes in patients treated with EG-1962 was 41% versus 27% for those patients treated with standard of care oral nimodipine. The data are presented in the table below:

There was no dose response with regards to outcome noted in the individual cohorts. All EG-1962 dose cohorts achieved favorable outcome proportions higher than oral nimodipine standard of care controls with proportions ranging from 40% to 78%. Differences in outcome rates were affected by the variability in WFNS scores and age among cohorts. The charts below show the key efficacy results for dose cohorts 1-5 (100 mg - 800 mg).

The study’s exploratory endpoints included rates of delayed complications such as angiographic vasospasm and DCI and the use of rescue therapy. The overall favorable outcome results seen in the EG-1962 arm were supported by the reduction in angiographic vasospasm, DCI, and rescue therapy. EG-1962 reduced the risk of angiographic vasospasm by 51% (30% EG-1962 vs. 61% oral nimodipine); reduced the risk of DCI by 55% (15% EG-1962 vs. 33% oral nimodipine); and reduced the risk of rescue therapy by 54% (26% EG-1962 vs. 56% oral nimodipine). The data for these exploratory endpoints are summarized in the table below:


Further analysis in those patients suffering angiographic vasospasm and/or DCI noted nearly a threefold greater rate of favorable outcome (53% EG-1962 vs. 18% standard of care oral nimodipine), which we believe suggests a pleiotropic effect (meaning actions other than those for which the agent was specifically developed) of higher nimodipine levels in the CSF versus standard of care oral nimodipine.
 
Additionally, EG-1962 reduced ICU, and hospital LOS, which are supportive of the overall clinical outcome results seen with EG-1962 and suggest meaningful pharmacoeconomic benefits.  EG-1962 demonstrated a 3.5-day reduction in ICU length of stay compared to oral nimodipine (median EG-1962 hospital LOS was 13.5 days, median oral nimodipine LOS was 17 days). In addition, EG-1962 demonstrated a 2.5 day reduction in hospital LOS compared to oral nimodipine (median EG-1962 hospital LOS was 22.5 days, median oral nimodipine hospital LOS was 25 days).
 
Regulatory Pathway
 
We expect to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, under the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing approved product, or published literature, in support of its NDA.  In Europe, we expect to submit a marketing application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, using the Centralized Procedure for review and approval of EG-1962.
Intracisternal Study
 
A Phase 1 study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes of EG-1962 administered intracisternally directly into the basal cisterns of the brain is open for enrollment for patients with an aSAH who do not receive an EVD, but remain at risk for delayed neurological complications following repair of a ruptured aneurysm.  This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled open-label study in which nine patients are expected to receive EG-1962 via intracisternal administration and three patients are expected to receive standard of care oral nimodipine. Based on our analysis of interim data from five patients, the four patients who received EG-1962 cisternally achieved steady state plasma concentrations of nimodipine over a 14-day period, with concentration levels below the levels associated with hypotension.
Commercial Strategy
 
Because an aSAH is a major medical emergency, patients are typically referred or immediately transported to academic or major medical centers where they are treated and monitored by a neurosurgeon or neurointensivist. If EG-1962 is approved, we plan to establish targeted commercialization and marketing capabilities for our products in the United States, Canada and possibly the European Union, or EU.  In the United States and Canada, approximately 300 top academic medical centers treat approximately 90% of all aSAH patients. As such, we believe a small, targeted sales force could effectively cover these institutions and successfully commercialize our products, if approved. In the United States, we intend to commercialize by developing a hospital sales force of up to 50 representatives that would focus on academic medical centers and other major medical centers treating acute neurological conditions.  We believe a similar sized sales force would be appropriate for the EU, should we decide to commercialize EG-1962 there using an Edge sales force.  For commercialization of our products, if approved, outside of the United States and Canada, we may enter into collaborations or license agreements with strategic partners.
Reimbursement
 
Significant hospital resources are used to manage, treat and monitor patients with an aSAH.  According to a study published in Neurosurgery in 2010, the average incremental direct hospital cost to treat an aSAH patient with DCI is approximately $50,000 compared to patients without DCI. In the same study, those patients suffering from DCI had an average hospital LOS of more than six days longer than those that did not experience severe complications. By contrast, patients in our NEWTON study treated with EG-1962 had a median reduction of ICU and hospital LOS of 3.5 and 2.5 days, respectively.  Additionally, the lifetime cost of illness associated with chronically disabled patients presents a significant economic burden to the entire inpatient and long-term healthcare system. Further, we estimate that the average hospital charge in 2013 for a patient with an aSAH was about $300,000, and exceeds $400,000 for aSAH patients with an EVD. Accordingly, we believe the pharmacoeconomic benefits of EG-1962, if approved, can further support adoption by hospital administrators and payors and may help to justify premium pricing.

EG-1964
 
We are using our Precisa platform to seek to develop EG-1964 for the management of cSDH as a prophylactic treatment to prevent recurrent bleeding.  EG-1964 contains synthetic aprotinin, a pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that, in its non-synthetic form, originally was obtained from bovine lung and initially marketed as Trasylol®. By way of a single administration at the time of the first neurosurgical intervention, EG-1964 may be able to deliver a high concentration of aprotinin directly to the subdural space with sustained drug exposure over 21 to 28 days. Since there are no effective ways to determine which patients are at risk for the recurrence of cSDH, we believe EG-1964, if approved, can be a prophylactic treatment for all patients with cSDH.
Background and Current Standard of Care
 
A cSDH is a liquefied hematoma that has accumulated on the surface of the brain in an area referred to as the subdural space. It is often caused by head trauma, most commonly in patients aged 60 or older. When the brain shrinks inside the skull over time, even minor head trauma can cause blood to leak into the subdural space. This results in a slow accumulation of blood over several days to weeks and, over time, the subdural hematoma expands by recurrent bleeding due to excess fibrinolysis, a mechanism that breaks down blood clots. Typically, the initial presentation of cSDH is managed with neurosurgical intervention during which small holes are drilled in the skull to drain the liquefied hematoma from the subdural space. Rebleeding in the subdural space occurs in up to 30% of cSDH patients, which requires a repeat neurosurgical intervention and is associated with risks of serious complications, including death.  There are no therapeutic treatments currently available that reduce the risk of recurrence of cSDH. The only treatment available is to perform another neurosurgical operation that is often more extensive in order to drain the liquefied hematoma from the subdural space. If a therapeutic agent were approved to decrease the incidence of rebleeding, it could potentially be used in most patients as a prophylactic treatment.
Our Solution: EG-1964
 
Aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor isolated from the lungs and pancreas which had been sold under the brand name Trasylol, was approved by the FDA in 1993 to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.  Plasmin, a naturally produced enzyme, breaks down blood clots. Aprotinin, by inhibiting plasmin, preserves or prevents the breakdown of the blood clot, thereby limiting recurrent bleeding.  By 2000, aprotinin became the standard of care to prevent excessive bleeding in cardiac surgery. However, aprotinin is no longer used via intravenous administration as it has been withdrawn from the U.S. market due to the potential for serious side effects resulting from clotting outside of the targeted area, and the FDA has notified compounding pharmacies to cease making it available.  We believe that delivery of synthetic aprotinin directly at the site of the brain injury would mitigate the potential increased risk of clotting and other systemic complications associated with the use of systemic aprotinin.
EG-1964 Commercial Strategy
 
Patients suffering from cSDH are typically treated in academic or major medical centers where they are monitored or managed by a neurosurgeon or neurointensivist. If both EG-1962 and EG-1964 are approved, we anticipate a large overlap in our sales force call points between EG-1962 and EG-1964. Under this scenario, we plan to increase the size of our sales force only modestly to commercialize EG-1964. We may selectively partner with third parties to commercialize our products in regions outside of the United States and Canada, or we may opt to commercialize our products in some of these regions on our own.
 
EG-1965
 
We are using our Precisa platform to seek to develop our product candidate EG-1965.  EG-1965 contains amiodarone, a Vaughan Williams class III agent that (1) inhibits inward potassium current, (ii) has antisympathetic and calcium-blocking activity that leads to important effects on the sinoatrial, or SA, and atrial fibrillation, or AV, nodes, and (3) has sodium channel–inhibiting properties that increase the threshold for depolarization.  EG-1965 is being developed using our Precisa development platform for the prevention of POAF. By way of a single administration at the time of the surgical intervention, we believe EG-1965 can deliver an effective concentration of amiodarone directly to the atrial myocardium with sustained drug exposure for up to seven days.
 
Background
 
POAF is the most frequent complication of cardiothoracic surgery, with an incidence varying between 20% and 60%, depending on the type of procedure and the criteria for diagnosis.  It typically develops within the first five days following cardiothoracic surgery.  POAF is independently associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality caused by stroke, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism and bleeding from anticoagulation. It significantly increases postoperative length of hospital stay, resource utilization and hospital readmission rate.
Page | 16
 
 Index

Current Standard of Care
 
No therapy is approved for prevention of POAF. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American College of Cardiology, the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons, the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology recommend beta-blockers to reduce the likelihood of developing POAF or, for higher-risk patients, administration of amiodarone starting preoperatively.  While amiodarone is generally regarded to be the most effective agent for preventing POAF, it is reserved as a second-line agent because of an associated risk for potentially severe systemic adverse reactions such as thyroid, pulmonary and hepatic toxicity.  Although not specifically approved for this indication, amiodarone is commonly used to treat POAF and multiple studies employing systemic administration of amiodarone have demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing POAF.
 
Based on the lack of any approved therapies and the high morbidity and mortality and burden of illness associated with POAF, we believe this represents a major unmet medical need that requires new therapies to improve outcome of cardiothoracic surgery patients.
 
Our Solution: EG-1965
 
EG-1965, which utilizes our Precisa development platform containing amiodarone, is being developed for the potential prevention of POAF following cardiothoracic surgeries.  EG-1965 is designed to be applied directly to the atrial myocardium and to release amiodarone to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the myocardium for up to seven days, sufficient to cover the period of highest risk for developing POAF.
 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient for EG-1965 is amiodarone. Amiodarone has been in clinical use in the US for over 30 years and in EU for over 50 years. The pharmacology of amiodarone has been exhaustively described.
 
We believe that sustained, local delivery of amiodarone directly to the target tissue (atrial myocardium) by EG-1965 provides a number of significant benefits versus systemic administration, including:
 
 
● | Total dose of amiodarone in EG-1965 will be associated with very low circulating amiodarone concentrations near or below the lower limits of detection, thus virtually eliminating exposure of off-target tissues to potentially toxic concentrations of drug;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Minimal or no interference with hepatic metabolism or transport of drugs cleared via CYP3A4, CYP2C8 or P-gp transporter mechanisms; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Effective local steady-state concentrations achieved with a single administration within hours and maintained over an appropriate/clinically relevant time period, without a loading dose, instead of the days required for systemic administration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development
 
The overall objective for EG-1965 is to establish it as an effective and safe treatment for preventing POAF in patients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgeries. In 2018, we intend to complete formulation development activities and commence pre-clinical studies of EG-1965.  Based on the results of those studies, we may submit an IND for EG-1965 in 2019.
Commercial Strategy
 
Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery who are at risk for POAF are treated in the hospital by the cardiothoracic surgeon. Because both EG-1962 and EG-1965 are hospital-based products, we anticipate overlap in our sales force call points between the two, if both are approved.   Since more hospitals perform cardiothoracic surgery than treat aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, we plan to increase the size of our sales force to commercialize EG-1965, if both it and EG-1962 are approved. We may selectively partner with third parties to commercialize our products in regions outside of the United States and Canada.
Our Precisa Development Platform
 
Overview
 
Precisa is our proprietary, programmable, biodegradable polymer-based development platform. Our Precisa platform’s proprietary nature stems from the use of our technology, know-how and trade secrets and those of our commercial partners. The Precisa platform is programmable in that it allows us to systematically vary the physical and chemical properties of formulations, such as size, shape and surface properties, as well as the type and mix of components of the formulation, in order to obtain the desired release kinetics of a specified therapeutic. For example, technology, know-how and trade secrets to which we have rights have resulted in the development of EG-1962, a formulation that is designed to utilize biodegradable PLGA microparticles to deliver a desired dose of nimodipine to the brain to improve patient outcomes following aSAH.
Page | 17
 
 Index

The Precisa development platform allows us to create polymer-based therapeutics that we believe are capable of delivering therapeutics directly to the site of injury to potentially avoid serious systemic side effects often associated with oral or intravenous delivery and to potentially enable high and sustained drug exposure with only a single dose at the initial time of procedural or surgical intervention.
Rational Design. Once we have identified an unmet clinical condition and identified several therapeutics that may have activity against this condition, we intend to engineer multiple types of polymer-based formulations and systematically vary physical and chemical properties, such as particle size, surface properties, dose level and release profile, using an established process. We program our Precisa platform to achieve an initial and sustained release rate with effective targeting (based on form) for a particular administration given the organ or tissue target. We believe that this development platform allows us to advance a new product candidate from concept to preclinical testing in an expedited manner.
Targeted Delivery. We use our Precisa platform to design our product candidates based on specific physical and chemical properties (size, shape, surface area) that allow for one-time administration at or near the targeted injured organ or tissue. The diagram below depicts the specific form of Precisa microparticles containing nimodipine (EG-1962) that are approximately 65 microns in diameter, which is small enough to allow easy administration through an EVD, yet large enough to prevent macrophages from carrying the microparticles away from the site of injury.
 

Controlled and sustained drug exposure. We program our Precisa platform with a specific blend of one or more polymers in order to obtain the desired release profile of the selected therapeutic agent. This is accomplished by immersing the specified therapeutic agent in a matrix of one or more clinically-acceptable, biodegradable and biocompatible polymers. The polymeric foundation of EG-1962 is PLGA, the polymer in dissolvable sutures that has been used since the 1970’s. PLGA is biodegradable, has minimal toxicity in humans, even when used intracranially, and is one of the few matrix delivery systems where drug release can be sustained over weeks. EG-1962 is designed so that, upon administration, the therapeutic agent that is on the surface of the polymer is released to provide high early concentrations of such therapeutic agent. Subsequently, the therapeutic agent dispersed throughout the microparticle begins to diffuse through the polymer-based matrix and the polymer breaks down into lactic acid and glycolic acid, compounds naturally found in the body, in order to deliver the therapeutic with the desired release profile.

 Selection of Therapeutic
 
We believe that we can use our Precisa development platform to incorporate therapeutics with a wide range of physicochemical properties such as small molecules and proteins. We have demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies that nimodipine, an L-type calcium channel antagonist, manufactured into a polymer-based microparticle and suspended in diluent of sodium hyaluronate, provided differentiated pharmacokinetics. We are also using our Precisa development platform to formulate both EG-1964 and EG-1965.
Intellectual Property
 
The protection of our product candidates, our manufacturing methods, delivery systems and patient treatment protocols, and associated trade secrets and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally relating to EG-1962, our lead product candidate, a microparticulate formulation of nimodipine; EG-1964, which utilizes our Precisa development platform containing aprotinin; and EG-1965, which utilizes our Precisa development platform containing amiodarone. Our policy is to seek, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or in-licensed, and to protect technologies, improvements and trade secrets that may be important to our business.
 
Our commercial success will depend in part upon obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates, including components of our proprietary formulations, methods of manufacturing our product candidates, delivery systems, and methods of treating patients with our product candidates, as well as successfully defending our patent rights against third party challenges. Our ability to prevent or stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates will depend in part upon whether we have valid and enforceable patent rights that cover the activities of third parties.
 
Patent Rights
 
We have been building and plan to continue to build our patent portfolio. Where possible, we pursue multi-tiered patent protection for our product candidates and their manufacture, delivery and use. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we file counterpart patent applications in various countries and regions where we think such foreign filing is likely to be cost-effective.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent. However, the term of a United States patent may be shortened, if the patent term for a patent is terminally disclaimed by its owner, over another patent.
 
Patent Rights Associated with EG-1962
 
We wholly-own one issued U.S. patent (expected to expire in 2029 if all maintenance fees are paid) directed to a method of treating a cerebral vasospasm in a human by administering a pharmaceutical composition via surgical injection into the subarachnoid space in a cistern closest to a cerebral artery at risk for vasospasm.

 We wholly own one pending U.S. application and one international PCT application directed to site-specific microparticulate pharmaceutical formulations comprising (a) a therapeutic amount of an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist; (b) a poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer comprising from 25% to 50% glycolide; and (c) less than 5% hyaluronic acid, wherein the microparticles of the formulation are characterized by a particle size from about 20 μm to about 125 μm; (ii) a drug load of from about 50% to about 70%; (iii) sustained release; and (iv) at least 99% purity, and their use for treating a delayed complication of a brain injury associated with interruption of a cerebral artery comprising a delayed cerebral ischemia that is effective to reduce incidence of poor clinical outcome. The 30 month date for the PCT application to enter the national stage is October 7, 2018.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we have used our Precisa development platform, in collaboration with Evonik Industries, or Evonik, to seek to develop pharmaceutical compositions that contain particular polymorphic forms of nimodipine. Based on the collaboration, we co-own, together with Evonik, two issued U.S. patents claiming a process for producing microparticles encapsulating a particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, a semisolid delivery system containing microparticles comprising the particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, and a method of treating a cerebral artery in a subarachnoid space at risk of interruption due to a brain injury using such a delivery system. These patents are expected to expire in 2033 if all maintenance fees are paid. We also co-own, with Evonik, related patents granted in Australia and Canada, and a patent application that has received a notice of allowance in Korea, as well as patent applications pending in Brazil, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Russia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom relating to these technologies. The issued U.S. patents cover the microparticulate formulation used in the NEWTON study.  Evonik, as successor to SurModics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or SurModics, under our license agreement initially with SurModics, has granted us an exclusive, field-restricted, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under its patent rights together with enforcement rights against infringers, all pursuant to our license agreement with Evonik relating to the co-owned patent rights. The Evonik license agreement is discussed in more detail below.
 
We have two pending U.S. patent applications claiming a scalable process for producing microparticles encapsulating a particular polymorphic form of nimodipine (different from the form described in the applications co-owned with Evonik), a composition formulated for delivery by injection using this form of nimodipine, a micronized version of such composition, and a method of reducing the severity or incidence of delayed complications associated with a brain injury by administering the composition locally either intraventricularly, intracisternally, or intrathecally.  An international patent application has been filed covering the inventions claimed.
 
We also have one U.S. and 11 foreign applications pending that claim a method for at least one adverse consequence of an eye disease comprising abnormal intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease and retinal ganglion cell death in order to reduce visual loss in a human subject in need thereof comprising administering a therapeutic amount of a flowable microparticulate pharmaceutical composition intraocularly to a site of delivery selected from the group consisting of a vitreous humor of the eye, an aqueous humor of the eye, and or both.
 
Patent Rights Associated with EG-1964
 
With respect to EG-1964, we wholly-own one issued U.S. patent (scheduled to expire in 2031 if all maintenance fees are paid) directed to a method of treating hematoma expansion or recurrent bleeding resulting from a hemorrhagic condition (e.g., cSDH) by administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-fibrinolytic agent (e.g., aprotinin). We also have a pending U.S. patent application where we are pursuing claims to a pharmaceutical composition containing an anti-fibrinolytic agent. Patents have been granted in Australia (two patents, one notice of allowance), Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.  We are also seeking additional patent protection in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Russia, and the United Kingdom.
Patent Rights Associated with EG-1965
 
With respect to EG-1965, we have filed a U.S. non-provisional patent application directed to (i) a malleable drug delivery system comprising a particulate formulation, containing an anti-arrhythmic agent, that is characterized by its ability to contact, adhere to, and/or conform to the tissue surface susceptible to atrial fibrillation, and (ii) a method for reducing atrial fibrillation by using such delivery system. We expect to file additional patent applications in other countries and regions at the appropriate time.
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, for some aspects of our proprietary technology, trade secret protection is more appropriate than patent protection. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, for example, our manufacturing processes, via, among other things, confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how by implementing and maintaining security of our premises and information, and limiting access to our trade secrets and know-how.

 License Agreement with Evonik
 
In October 2010, we entered into a license agreement with SurModics, the predecessor to Evonik (the “Evonik Agreement”). Under the Evonik Agreement, we have an exclusive (even as to Evonik), worldwide, sublicensable and royalty-bearing license under certain Evonik patent rights (including patent rights jointly owned with Edge, the Evonik rights of which are exclusively licensed back to Edge) and know-how to develop, make, have made, use offer for sale, sell, export and import one or more specified active agents, including nimodipine, in a proprietary polymer-based formulation for intracranial delivery to prevent or treat delayed complications following intracranial hemorrhage.  Depending on the manufacturing process we use, EG-1962 may be covered by Evonik patent rights (including patent rights jointly owned with Edge, the Evonik rights of which are exclusively licensed back to Edge) and/or covered by Evonik know-how.
 
Under the terms of the Evonik Agreement, in connection with EG-1962, we may be obligated to make milestone payments totaling $14.75 million.  We made an initial upfront payment to Evonik upon execution of the Evonik Agreement in 2010, and made a second milestone payment in July 2016. We are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone events for each product covered by the Evonik Agreement (an “Evonik Licensed Product”).  In addition, we are obligated to pay a mid-single-digit percentage on net sales of Evonik Licensed Products, subject to reduction for certain specified circumstances. Our royalty obligations for each Evonik Licensed Product will continue, on a country by country basis, for the longer of twelve years from the first commercial sale of the Evonik Licensed Product if there is no valid claim that covers the manufacture, use or sale of the Product, or the period of time during which the manufacture, use or sale of the Evonik Licensed Product is covered by a valid claim of a licensed Evonik patent. In addition, we agreed to pay Evonik 15% of any consideration received from a sublicense of the licensed Evonik intellectual property rights, which does not include any royalties on sales, funds received for research and development or proceeds from any equity or debt investment.
 
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals to market each Evonik Licensed Product in major markets throughout the world and to maximize net sales after receipt of such approvals, as well as to achieve certain specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones.
 
In September 2015, we and Evonik entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Evonik Agreement. This amendment clarified our obligations to pay Evonik certain royalty and milestone payments in respect of Evonik Licensed Products whether or not manufactured by Evonik and removed our obligation to negotiate exclusively with Evonik for Phase 3 and commercial supply of EG-1962.
 
The term of the Evonik Agreement, as amended, will continue until the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Evonik. Either party may terminate the Evonik Agreement due to material breach by the other party. Evonik may terminate the license agreement or convert it to a non-exclusive license, in either case upon giving us written notice, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to hit certain specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Evonik Licensed Products.
 
We also have certain manufacturing licenses from Oakwood Laboratories, L.L.C., as described below.
 
Manufacturing
 
Product candidates using our Precisa development platform are manufactured using a single-step emulsion process with well-defined and reproducible operations. We do not own or operate current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce the amounts of our product candidates necessary for our preclinical research, clinical studies, and planned commercial activities. As part of the manufacture and design process for our product candidates, we rely on internal, scientific and manufacturing know-how and trade secrets and the know-how and trade secrets of third party manufacturers. We currently employ highly qualified internal manufacturing and quality assurance resources to manage our manufacturing contractors.
Oakwood Amended and Restated Master Formulation Development Agreement
 
In June 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Master Formulation Development Agreement (the “Restated Development Agreement”) with Oakwood Laboratories, L.L.C. (“Oakwood”), pursuant to which Oakwood will continue to provide us with certain drug formulation development and non-commercial manufacturing services for EG-1962, in accordance with project plans to be entered into from time to time.  Oakwood is currently performing process engineering, optimization and other scale up activities for us and is currently the sole manufacturer of EG-1962 used in Edge’s ongoing NEWTON 2 Phase 3 pivotal study for EG-1962.
 
Under the Restated Development Agreement, we agreed to pay Oakwood to perform services under agreed upon project plans and to pay Oakwood up to an aggregate of $4.5 million.  In July 2017, we paid $1.5 million of such aggregate amount in connection with entering into the Restated Development Agreement.  Of the remaining $3.0 million of such aggregate amount, $0.5 million is payable no later than April 1, 2018 and $2.5 million is payable no later than April 1, 2019.  These remaining payments may be accelerated if: (i) we achieve various regulatory milestones, (ii) we close an equity or similar financing in excess of a predetermined amount, or (iii) there is an early termination, under certain circumstances, of the Restated Development Agreement or the Supply Agreement with Oakwood.

 As additional consideration for performance under the Restated Development Agreement and the Supply Agreement (as defined below), we agreed to pay Oakwood a royalty, during the Royalty Term, in an amount equal to a low single digit percentage of net sales of EG-1962, regardless of the manufacturer or supplier thereof.  The “Royalty Term” is the period commencing upon the commercial launch of EG-1962 by the Company and continuing until twelve (12) years following such launch.
 
The term of the Restated Development Agreement continues until the expiration or termination of the Supply Agreement, unless earlier terminated (the “Term”).  We have the right to terminate project plans upon the occurrence of various circumstances described in the Restated Development Agreement.  In the event that we terminate the most recent project plan prior to completion (including due to our decision to discontinue the development or commercialization of EG-1962), we must pay to Oakwood a termination fee.  Either party has the right to terminate the Restated Development Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice for failure by the other party to cure a material breach during the applicable cure period.  We can terminate the Restated Development Agreement immediately upon notice to Oakwood if Oakwood’s annual financial audit report required to be provided to us contains any going concern or similar qualification or if Oakwood fails to maintain a pre-determined working capital ratio.  Either party may also terminate the Restated Development Agreement immediately in the event of certain failures with regard to validation of the manufacturing process and other specified regulatory failures.
 
Oakwood Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
 
Concurrent with our entry into the Restated Development Agreement, in June 2017, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Oakwood (the “Supply Agreement”), pursuant to which Oakwood will manufacture and supply, and we will purchase from Oakwood, EG-1962 in commercial quantities following the commercial launch of the product.
 
Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, the price per unit of EG-1962 to be purchased by us is based on the expected commercially usable units per batch.  In addition, we have agreed to pay Oakwood milestone payments that could total up to an aggregate of $2.25 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
 
We will have no minimum order requirement under the Supply Agreement until the third (3rd) year following commercial launch of EG-1962.  Beginning in the third year following commercial launch and continuing until the fifth year following commercial launch, we will be required to (x) order, at a minimum, the greater of (a) five (5) batches and (b) fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate vials of EG-1962 purchased by us from all sources in such year (such greater amount being the “Minimum Order Commitment”) or (y) pay a catch-up price to Oakwood based on the amount of EG-1962 actually ordered by us during the applicable time period.
 
The term of the Supply Agreement will continue (unless earlier terminated) until three (3) years following commercial launch of EG-1962. Thereafter, the Supply Agreement will automatically renew for additional two (2)-year periods unless we provide notice of non-renewal at least twelve (12) months prior to the end of the then-current term.  The Supply Agreement will also terminate automatically upon the termination of the Restated Development Agreement for any reason.  Following the first anniversary of the commercial launch of EG-1962, either party may terminate upon two (2) years written notice.  Further, either party may terminate the Supply Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that fails to be cured in the applicable cure period.
 
We may terminate the Supply Agreement immediately upon notice to Oakwood in the event that (a) any regulatory authority requires or causes the withdrawal of EG-1962 from the market or (b) we cease to develop or commercialize EG-1962; provided, that in the latter case of termination prior to completion of the most recent project plan attached to the Restated Development Agreement, we must pay to Oakwood a termination fee.
 
Other Third Party Manufacturers
 
EG-1962 is a polymer-based microparticle containing nimodipine suspended in a diluent of sodium hyaluronate.  We have entered into long-term supply agreements with separate companies that provide polymer, nimodipine and sodium hyaluronate to ensure access to drug substance, diluent and EG-1962 microparticles for commercial supply purposes.  We currently have access to sufficient drug substance of EG-1965 for formulation and our planned pre-clinical studies and are in the process of developing cGMP product for EG-1965 acceptable for use in future clinical studies.

 Competition
 
Generally, our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We may face competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for the treatment of indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future, and such competitors' products may be more effective, better tolerated or less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient enrollment in clinical studies.
 
To our knowledge, there is limited competition and are limited product candidates under development to improve patient outcomes after aSAH in the current marketplace. In the United States, only oral forms (gelcaps or solution) of nimodipine are approved for marketing for aSAH.  We are aware that Grace Therapeutics, LLC, or Grace Therapeutics, has announced that it plans to submit an NDA for an intravenous infusion form of nimodipine in the first half of 2018 and that Idorsia Ltd. has announced that it expects to initiate a Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of clazosentan in an aSAH population enriched for the risk of cerebral vasospasm in 2018.  In addition, in the United States, sodium nitrite has been tested by Hope Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Hope Pharmaceuticals, in a Phase 2 trial in 19 patients.  In 2017, Hope Pharmaceuticals terminated an additional Phase 2 trial after enrolling 6 patients.
 
In Europe, both intravenous and oral forms of nimodipine are available. In Japan and some parts of Asia, fasudil (Eril ®) and ozagrel (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, known by various brand names) are available.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products.  Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FD&C Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record-keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of certain preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, and good manufacturing practice, or GMP, requirements. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither raised objections on nor placed the IND on hold within this 30-day period, the clinical study(ies) proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical studies generally involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical studies must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, which are a collection of FDA and international standards meant to protect the rights, health and safety of patients, and to define the roles of sponsors, administrators, and monitors, as well as ensure data integrity; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market development requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
The submission of an NDA is required to introduce a new drug product into the U.S. market.  It is the responsibility of the company seeking to market a drug to test it and submit evidence that it is safe and effective for the proposed labeled indication and population. The FDA and their scientists reviews the sponsor's NDA containing the data and proposed labeling.

 Index

The goals of the NDA are to provide enough information to permit an FDA reviewer to reach the following key decisions:
 
 
● | Whether the drug is safe and effective in its intended use(s), and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Whether the drug's proposed labeling (package insert) is appropriate, and what it should contain.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Whether the methods used in manufacturing the drug and the controls used to maintain the drug's quality are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of an NDA. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to an application for a drug that treats a serious condition and that the FDA determines, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The review process may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
In assessing whether to approve an NDA, the FDA may request advice from an advisory committee.  Advisory committees provide independent advice and recommendations to the FDA on scientific and technical matters related to the development and evaluation of products regulated by the FDA.  Committee members are scientific experts such as physician-researchers and statisticians, and, on an ad hoc basis, may also include representatives of the public, including patients.  Although the committees provide recommendations to the FDA, final decisions are made by FDA.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness in approving a similar product or published literature in support of its application. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is one that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or assessments to support the change from the approved product. The 505(b)(2) pathway may be used to seek approval of the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for new indication(s) for which the referenced product is not approved.  For the latter, FDA would likely require clinical studies to support approval of the product candidate for use in the new indication(s).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book.  The Orange Book identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by the FDA under the FD&C Act.  Thus, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification that the listed patent is invalid or not infringed and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 
Several FDA programs are available that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition.  The four principal programs are Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation.  The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, a new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if (i) it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition, or (ii) it has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product.  Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.  Potential benefits of Fast Track designation include, but are not limited to, more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support approval, and rolling review, which, in the case of Fast Track designation, means that if, based on preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, FDA determines that a Fast Track-designated drug may be effective, FDA may consider reviewing portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.  Obtaining Fast Track designation does not, however, change the evidentiary standards for NDA approval.

 Another program intended to expedite development and review of new drugs is the accelerated approval program.  In 2012, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety Innovations Act, or FDASIA. Section 901 of FDASIA amends the FD&C Act to allow the FDA to base accelerated approval for drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint.
 
A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality, or IMM.
 
The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. Studies that demonstrate a drug’s effect on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint must be “adequate and well controlled” as required by the FD&C Act.
 
Using surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoints can save valuable time in the drug approval process. The drug company will still need to conduct studies to confirm that the surrogate or intermediate endpoint actually predicts the clinical benefit. These studies are known as Phase 4 confirmatory trials.
 
Where confirmatory trials verify clinical benefit, FDA will generally terminate the requirement.  Approval of a drug may be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the drug changed if trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug (e.g., show a significantly smaller magnitude or duration of benefit than was anticipated based on the observed effect on the surrogate).
 
Breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. For the purposes of this designation, clinically significant endpoint generally refers to an endpoint that measures an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or on symptoms that represent serious consequences of the disease. A drug that receives this designation is eligible for all Fast Track designation features, and intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, including a commitment for FDA senior managers' involvement.
 
Additional measures intended to expedite drug product development and review were also included in the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act.  Signed into law on December 13, 2016, the Cures Act includes several provisions intended to enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. These include, but are not limited to, provisions that (i) require FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, (ii) require FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs, and (iii) provide that FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. If at any time the FDA becomes aware of new information regarding the safety of an approved product, the FDA may issue an early public safety alert that makes initial recommendations in light of the new information until the FDA fully evaluates the information and makes final conclusions and recommendations. The FDA may also require manufacturers to change product labeling to address the new safety concerns.
 
In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Submission of a NDA would further expose our CMOs to a focused pre-approval inspection by the FDA or other regulatory health authority.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality assurance to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may take regulatory action (e.g. Warning Letter, Consent Decree, Import Alert, etc.) if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FD&C Act
 
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing based on in vitro studies and/or human clinical studies, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, additional pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Some ANDA applicants may apply for and be granted a waiver for the requirement to conduct in vivo bioequivalence studies. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and, subject to state laws, can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) a patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims a method of using such drug has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the ANDA applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 
Patent Term Extension and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored as a patent term extension. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
 
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase - the time between IND application and NDA submission – and all of the review phase – the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the patent term extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

 Market exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FD&C Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition – generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular drug to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market any drug considered the same drug as the drug with the orphan drug exclusivity for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. In addition, if a company seeks orphan drug designation for a drug considered the same drug as a drug previously approved for the orphan indication at issue, the FDA will not designate the same drug as an orphan drug unless the company articulates a plausible hypothesis of the clinical superiority of its drug to the approved drug, and, following such designation, if the previously approved drug has unexpired orphan drug exclusivity, FDA will not approve the subsequent drug unless the sponsor demonstrates clinical superiority over the previously approved drug prior to approval.
 
In addition, as FDA has interpreted the Orphan Drug Act, even if a previously approved same drug does not have unexpired orphan exclusivity, while a demonstration of clinical superiority is not required for a subsequent orphan-designated drug to obtain marketing approval, a demonstration of clinical superiority is required for the subsequent orphan-designated same drug to be awarded a 7-year period of orphan exclusivity upon marketing approval. In recent years, there have been multiple legal challenges to this FDA interpretation, and in August 2017, Congress amended the orphan drug provisions of the FD&C Act through enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 to codify FDA’s longstanding interpretation. Section 527 of the FD&C Act now expressly provides that if a sponsor of a drug that is designated as an orphan drug and is otherwise the same as an already approved drug is seeking exclusive approval for the same rare disease or condition as the already approved drug, FDA shall require such sponsor, as a condition of such exclusive approval, to demonstrate that such drug is clinically superior to any already approved or licensed drug that is the same drug.
 
Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.  Edge has received orphan drug designation for EG-1962 for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. Recently, FDASIA amended the FD&C Act to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical studies, and/or other clinical development programs. Since EG-1962 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA Office of Orphan Product Development, or OOPD, it is exempt from the requirements of the PREA.

 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act amended the FD&C Act to provide NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity–patent or non-patent–for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies as outlined in the FD&C Act, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Similar requirements apply under the European Union Clinical Trials Directive.  Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. The European Union Clinical Trials Regulation which comes into force in 2018 will broaden the information that will be publicly available to include all information submitted in the clinical trial application and during the assessment procedure with the exception of information that falls within specific categories. In a rule issued on September 16, 2016 that went into effect on January 18, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, clarified and expanded the clinical trial reporting requirements.  The rule broadens the submission of additional registration and summary results information, and sets forth legal consequences for non-compliance.  Notably, unless a waiver is granted, the rule requires submission of results information for studies not only where a drug is approved by the FDA, but also where a drug is unapproved, regardless of whether FDA approval is or will be sought.  Although prior to enactment of the rule, disclosure of results for trials of unapproved drugs could be delayed until approval, the new rule generally limits the allowable delay period for results information submission for applicable clinical trials of unapproved drugs to two years after the submission of a certification (i.e., up to a total of three years after the primary completion date).  Thus, for the first time, extensive results information must be posted even for drugs that do not make it to market.  Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs or to request detailed records from FDA under the Freedom of Information Act.
 
In January 2018, FDA initiated a pilot program to evaluate whether disclosing certain information included within clinical study reports (CSRs) for pivotal studies for approximately nine NDAs improves public access to drug approval information. As part of this pilot, FDA plans to post on their website the parts of the CSRs that were most important to the FDA’s assessment of the safety and efficacy of the drug. Once the pilot program is complete, FDA will seek public feedback on further steps.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include Federal and State healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product and the patient or hospital cost-sharing amount. Third party payors or hospitals may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that adequate reimbursement will be provided for the product. In addition, we expect that our products may be used primarily in the inpatient hospital setting; products that are used in the inpatient hospital setting may be reimbursed by payors through a fixed payment for the hospital stay, or a similar type of “bundled” or “capitated” payment, that does not include a separate charge for drugs provided to the patient, which can discourage hospitals from furnishing higher-cost drugs to inpatients in some cases.  While mechanisms such as stop loss payments, New Technology Add on Payments (NTAP), and outlier payments exist to allow hospitals to seek additional reimbursement from payers, it is not guaranteed that adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain adequate use, coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, may only provide coverage at a reduced price or under severe restrictions on the types of patients they choose to use the product.
 
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment initiatives to limit the growth of Federal and State healthcare program costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs, and measures that accelerate the testing and expansion of new payment methods that may increase healthcare providers’ incentives to make treatment decisions that contain costs.  Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.

 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect this trend will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates (including new payment methods that may discourage healthcare providers from using higher-cost products) may be implemented in the future.
 
Starting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act also expanded health insurance coverage to many previously uninsured Americans, through a combination of federal subsidies for lower-income people who enrolled in health plans through health insurance Exchanges and enabling States to expand Medicaid eligibility with the federal government paying a high share of the cost.  President Trump and Congressional leaders have expressed interest in repealing these Affordable Care Act provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility. There have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In December 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which includes a repeal of the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, in October 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to review regulations applicable to association health plans and short-term health insurance, and announced that the administration would halt federal subsidies to insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that other repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage and/or in individuals having insurance coverage that provides less generous benefits.
 
Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly entering into agreements with US payers for "risk-based" or "outcomes-based" pricing contracts for novel, premium-priced pharmaceutical products.  By the time EG-1962 is launched, these innovative pricing approaches may be expected as a means of obtaining use, coverage and reimbursement of the product, and may be incorporated into Edge's strategy to market the product to provide benefit to the greatest number of patients.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page | 29
 
 Index

 
● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state price transparency laws, such as the California state law requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain price increases, signed into law October 2017 by California Governor Jerry Brown.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
The False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the FCA in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the FCA is a civil statute, conduct that results in a FCA violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the FCA and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the FCA.
 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

● | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to outpatient drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a regulation that would have expanded Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well as of April 2017, but that decision has now been delayed. In addition, legislation predating the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and, for multiple source drugs, certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of data on average pharmacy acquisition cost, which potentially could negatively impact our sales.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs, the manufacturer must extend discounts on outpatient drugs to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.

● | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA required pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin tracking this information in 2013 and to report this information to CMS on an annual basis beginning in 2014. The reported information was publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website in September 2014 and will be made publicly available on an annual basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that supersedes the Payment Advisory Board’s recommendations and that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been appropriated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in perpetuity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European Union Regulatory Controls
 
In the EU, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from a competent regulatory agency has been obtained.
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 
The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a revision process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. The Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 is estimated to enter into application during 2019 following determination of the full functionality of the EU clinical trials portal and database.
 
In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, is required to have been approved by the EMA prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA. In most EU countries, we are also required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial. In early 2017, we submitted a PIP application in which we requested a waiver of conducting pediatric studies for EG-1962. On June 7, 2017, the European Medicines Agency granted a product specific waiver from conducting pediatric clinical studies for EG-1962 for the treatment of aSAH in all subsets of the pediatric population on the basis that the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit as clinical studies are not feasible for the pediatric population.

 European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: the Community MA and National MA.
 
The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing an active substance authorized in the EEA after May 20, 2004 and which are intended for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, or for autoimmune or viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA for indications other than those already stated before May 20, 2004, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.  National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and cover marketing in their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.  For assessment of an MA submitted via the Centralized Procedure, the EMA is responsible for the validation and scientific evaluation of the application.  The EMA's CHMP carries out a scientific assessment of the application and give a recommendation on whether the medicine should be authorized or not. A favorable opinion is accompanied by a draft summary of the product's characteristics, the package leaflet, and the proposed text for the packaging.  The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days, subject to extensions if additional questions need to be addressed. Within 15 days of the EMA adopting a positive opinion on the MA, the EMA will forward its opinion to the European Commission to start the decision-making phase. The adoption of the decision should take place within approximately 67 days of the opinion of the EMA. The decision with legally binding effect is subsequently published in the Community Register.  An MA is initially valid for five years, subject to its renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least six months before the five-year period expires.
 
European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 
In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data protection/exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market protection/exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic product applicants from referencing the innovator’s dossier in a generic application for eight years, after which a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but an approved generic product may not be placed on the market for a further two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized  or the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 
In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity post-authorization. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

 Index

 Under EU law, before the marketing authorization is granted, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products is required to re-assess whether the criteria for orphan designation are still met. Otherwise, the orphan designation can be removed from the Community Register. If the orphan designation is maintained, the orphan medicinal product will benefit from 10 years of orphan market exclusivity which can be extended to 12 years following completion of the agreed studies in a pediatric investigation plan.
 
In EU member states, nimodipine has been approved for administration orally in tablet form and intravenously by injection. EG-1962 has been granted an orphan designation in the EU for the treatment of aSAH.
 
The Potential U.K. Exit from the European Union as a Result of the June 2016 U.K. Referendum.
 
In June 2016, the U.K. affirmatively voted in a non-binding referendum advising the U.K. to exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU. The formal notification triggered procedure set out in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process to conclude an agreement between the U.K. and the EU setting out the arrangements for the U.K.’s withdrawal, taking account of the framework for establishing the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU. The agreement must be concluded on behalf of the EU by the European Council acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
 
There is uncertainty about the terms of the final agreement and the framework for the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, and could have a material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries. In particular, there is uncertainty about whether the U.K. will continue to be within the single market and customs union for goods and services to be moved freely within the EU. This may impact whether goods including pharmaceutical products manufactured and/or imported into the U.K. from outside of the EU could continue to access the EU market. There is also uncertainty about whether marketing authorizations granted respectively in the U.K. and the EU would be mutually recognized following the U.K. leaves the EU.
 
Regulation Outside the EU
 
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as Canada, or countries in Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
