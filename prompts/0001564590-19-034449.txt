Item 1. Business
PCSB Financial Corporation
 PCSB Financial Corporation (“PCSB Financial” or the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, is the bank holding company for PCSB Bank (the “Bank”). On April 20, 2017, the Company completed its initial public offering in connection with the Bank’s conversion from a mutual savings bank to a stock savings bank, selling 17,826,408 shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share. In addition, the Company contributed 338,702 shares of common stock and $1.6 million in cash to the PCSB Community Foundation, a charitable foundation formed in connection with the conversion. As of June 30, 2019, we had consolidated assets of $1.64 billion, consolidated deposits of $1.23 billion and consolidated equity of $281.3 million. Other than holding the common stock of PCSB Bank, PCSB Financial has not engaged in any significant business to date. In the future, we may pursue other business activities, including mergers and acquisitions, investment alternatives and diversification of operations; however, there are no current agreements for these activities. 
 PCSB Bank
 PCSB Bank is a New York-chartered commercial bank, having converted from a savings bank charter effective January 1, 2019. We serve the banking needs of customers in the Lower Hudson Valley of New York State through our executive offices/headquarters and 15 banking offices located in Dutchess (3 offices), Putnam (3 offices), Rockland (1 office) and Westchester (8 offices) Counties, New York. Our primary business activity is attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds primarily to originate and purchase commercial real estate, business loans, and one-to four-family loans and purchase investment securities. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “NYSDFS”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).  
 Our website address is www.pcsb.com.  Information on our website is not and should not be considered a part of this annual report.
 Market Area
 Our primary market area encompasses all of Putnam and Westchester Counties, and parts of Dutchess and Rockland Counties in New York, which are the counties in which our offices are located, and the surrounding areas.  We view Westchester County, which borders the Bronx (New York City’s northernmost borough) and is more populous than the other counties, as a primary area for growth, particularly for commercial lending and deposit opportunities. Westchester County includes a high concentration of office, medical, retail, industrial, mixed use and multi-family real estate buildings and businesses. Our primary focus in this marketplace is small to middle market businesses in these segments. Rising real estate values and lack of available commercial space in Brooklyn and Manhattan have caused businesses to migrate to central and lower Westchester County, which has increased the demand for flex-industrial and multi-family loans in our market area. Dutchess, Putnam and Rockland Counties offer similar commercial opportunities to Westchester County, but on a significantly smaller scale, and provide greater opportunities in residential mortgage lending and consumer lending and in retail deposit gathering. The close proximity of Bronx County, New York City, Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Bergen County, New Jersey, to our market area also creates a secondary area of opportunity for office, industrial and multi-family property loans.
Competition
 We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area, many of which are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, have greater resources. We compete with these larger institutions particularly in our Westchester County market area. We also face competition for funds from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities issuers.

Competition for loans comes primarily from the many financial institutions operating in our market area. Our experience in recent years has been that many financial institutions in our market area, especially community banks seeking to expand their commercial loan portfolios and institutions located in highly competitive Westchester County, have been willing to price commercial loans aggressively in order to gain market share. We also compete with Fintech companies, which can digitally deliver banking products and services without the expenses associated with physical branch offices and without the regulatory compliance obligations and expenses to which banks are subject.
 Lending Activities
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2019, commercial real estate loans were $651.4 million, or 59.4%, of total loans receivable. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities, and multi-family properties. At June 30, 2019, multi-family residential real estate loans, which are described below, totaled $153.0 million.  Excluding multi-family loans, $84.5 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was owner occupied real estate and $413.9 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied real estate.
 At June 30, 2019, a substantial portion of our commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in the lower Hudson Valley; however, we will originate commercial real estate loans on properties located outside this area based on an established relationship with a strong borrower. We intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we also purchase and participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions. At June 30, 2019, we had $145.9 million in commercial real estate loan participations and whole loan purchases, which constituted 22.4% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, as compared with $94.0 million in commercial real estate loan participations and whole loan purchases, which constituted 19.0% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2018. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies and require satisfactory documentation review by our legal counsel before we will purchase or participate in such loans.
 We originate a variety of adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 25 years, which may include balloon payment loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every five, seven or ten years and generally are indexed to the prime rate or the corresponding Treasury rate, plus a margin. We generally include pre-payment penalties on commercial real estate loans we originate.  
 In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the current and projected ratio of net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 1.20x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. Generally, guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate customers. In addition, the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. We encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which would enhance our interest rate spread and overall profitability.
 If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.
 At June 30, 2019, our largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $26.6 million and is secured by a non-owner-occupied industrial property. At June 30, 2019, this loan was performing according to its original terms.

Multi-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2019, multi-family real estate loans were $153.0 million, or 13.9%, of total loans receivable. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five to 100 rental units in our market area.  In addition to originating these loans, we also purchase and participate in multi-family residential real estate loans with other financial institutions. At June 30, 2019, we had $68.1 million in multi-family residential real estate loan purchases and participations, which constituted 44.5% of our multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio, as compared with $63.4 million in multi-family residential real estate loan participations, which constituted 61.5% of our multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2018. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies and require satisfactory documentation review by our legal counsel before we will purchase or participate in such loans.
 We originate a variety of adjustable-rate multi-family residential real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 30 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every five, seven or ten years and generally are indexed to the prime rate or the corresponding Treasury rate, plus a margin. We generally include pre-payment penalties on multi-family residential real estate loans we originate.  
 In underwriting multi-family residential real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the current and projected ratio of net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 1.20x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower.  Generally, guarantees are obtained from multi-family residential real estate customers. In addition, the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. We encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which would enhance our interest rate spread and overall profitability.
 At June 30, 2019, our largest multi-family residential real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $23.5 million and is secured by a 76-unit apartment complex.  At June 30, 2019, this loan was performing according to its original terms.  
 Commercial Loans. We originate commercial term loans and adjustable rate lines of credit to a variety of small and medium sized businesses in our market area. These loans are generally secured by business assets, and we may support this collateral with junior liens on real property. At June 30, 2019, commercial business loans were $133.6 million, or 12.2% of total loans receivable. Customers for these loans include professional businesses, multi-generational family-owned businesses, and not for profit businesses. We encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which would enhance our interest rate spread and overall profitability.
 The commercial loans we offer include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either fixed or adjustable rates of interest. Adjustable rates are based on the prime rate, plus a margin. Commercial loans typically have shorter terms to maturity, higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans, and may involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral.
 When originating commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial loans are generally made in amounts of up to 75% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. All of these loans are secured by assets of the respective borrowers. 
 At June 30, 2019, our largest commercial loan had an outstanding balance of $27.7 million and is secured by 338 individual loans to medical professionals. At June 30, 2019, this loan was performing according to its original terms.
 Construction Loans. We originate loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family residential properties, and commercial and multi-family properties. At June 30, 2019, construction and land development loans were $13.2 million, or 1.2% of total loans receivable, consisting of $4.5 million of one- to four-family residential 
 5


construction loans and $8.7 million of commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. PCSB Bank will occasionally, through a local nonprofit, fund the construction of low-income multi-family properties.
 Most of our construction loans are interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 24 months. Interest is generally an adjustable rate based on the prime rate, plus a margin.  At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be payable in full. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant.
 At June 30, 2019, our largest construction and land development loan had an outstanding balance of $5.8 million and is secured by a medical office building. At June 30, 2019, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 Residential Mortgage Loans. Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At June 30, 2019, one- to four-family residential real estate loans were $265.2 million, or 24.2% of total loans receivable, consisting of $233.1 million of fixed-rate loans and $32.1 million of adjustable-rate loans. In addition to originating these loans, we also purchase and participate in residential mortgage loans from other financial institutions. At June 30, 2019, purchased and participated loans totaled $64.5 million, or 24.3% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio, as compared to $56.3 million, or 22.5% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018.  
 We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. Some of the properties include two- to four-unit properties, all of which are classified as residential mortgage loans. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate or purchase are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We also originate loans above the conforming limits, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We generally underwrite jumbo loans, whether originated or purchased, in a manner similar to conforming loans. Jumbo loans are common in our market area. We generally retain one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in our portfolio.
 We originate our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with initial interest rate adjustment periods of one, three, five, seven or ten years, based on changes in a designated market index. These loans are limited to a 200 basis point initial increase in their interest rate, a 200 basis point increase in their interest rate annually after the initial adjustment, and a maximum upward adjustment of 400 to 600 basis points over the life of the loan. We determine whether a borrower qualifies for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan in conformance with the underwriting guidelines set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the secondary mortgage market. In particular, we determine whether a borrower qualifies for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan with an initial fixed-rate period of five years or less based on the ability to repay both principal and interest using an interest rate which is 2.0% above the initial interest rate, including a reasonable estimate of real estate taxes and insurance, and taking into account the maximum debt-to-income ratio stipulated in the underwriting guidelines in the secondary mortgage market. The qualification for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan with an initial fixed-rate period exceeding five years is based on the borrower’s ability to repay at the initial fixed interest rate. 
 We will originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 80% without private mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95% with private mortgage insurance and where the borrower’s debt service does not exceed 45% of the borrower’s monthly cash flow. To encourage lending to low- and moderate-income home buyers, we have several in-house developed programs which can include low down payments, lender-paid PMI, a lower than market interest rate, or a grant to be used towards closing costs.

We generally do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties. We do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan.  Additionally, outside of the loan programs mentioned previously, we do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).
 Home Equity Lines of Credit.  At June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance owed on home equity lines of credit was $33.2 million, or 3.0% of total loans receivable. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the prime rate, plus a margin.
 The procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. 
 The home equity lines of credit that we originate are revolving lines of credit which generally have a term of 25 years, with draws available for the first ten years. Our 25-year lines of credit are interest only during the first ten years, and amortize on a fifteen-year basis thereafter. We generally originate home equity lines of credit with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan, although loan-to-value ratios may occasionally exceed 75% on a case-by-case basis. Maximum loan-to-value ratios are determined based on an applicant’s credit score, property value, loan amount and debt-to-income ratio. Rates are adjusted monthly based on changes in a designated market index.
 Other Loans. We offer consumer and deposit overdraft loans. At June 30, 2019, other loans were $365,000, and included $254,000 of personal loans and $111,000 of overdrafts. The procedures for underwriting these loans include an assessment of the applicant’s and guarantor’s, if applicable, payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.
Loan Underwriting Risks
 Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the property. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of net operating income before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20x. An environmental report is obtained for all commercial and multi-family real estate loans.
 Construction Loans.  Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values and the absorption associated with the completed project. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations.  All construction loans require an unlimited guarantee of completion (construction, including certificate of occupancy) for the project. 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and 
 7


the effects of state and local governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Typically, for-rent commercially occupied properties require minimum pre-leasing; and for condominiums or cooperative for sale development loans, the project is underwritten as a multi-family rental property. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the strength of the housing and commercial real estate markets in our market areas.
 Commercial Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business as the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself.  Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 
 Adjustable-Rate Loans.  While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is somewhat limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential loans.
 Consumer Loans.  Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. The Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain senior officers up to prescribed limits not exceeding $5.0 million depending on the officer’s experience.  Loans approved under these officer authorities require dual signatures of the loan officer assigned to the loan and the officer with the appropriate approval authority. Loans in excess of $5.0 million and up to $15.0 million require approval of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, as do any extensions of credit to classified borrowers in excess of $2.0 million or loans up to $5.0 million that involve an exception to policy. Loans greater than $15.0 million and loans greater than $5.0 million that involve exceptions to policy must be authorized by the Board of Directors. Exceptions are reported to the Board of Directors monthly.

Investment Activities
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, municipal government securities, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, and investment grade corporate bonds. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLBNY stock, which investment is based on the level of our FHLBNY borrowings. At June 30, 2019, our investment portfolio had a fair value of $418.5 million and consisted primarily of U.S. Government securities, U.S. Government agency securities, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and investment grade corporate bonds. 
 
We also have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities. Derivatives may be used to manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate movements or to provide service to customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. These interest rate swaps with customers are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party in order to minimize the net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. The notional amount of all derivatives to which we are a party is $68.5 million as of June 30, 2019.
 Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide a use of funds when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. Our management is responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews the status of our investment portfolio quarterly.  See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. To a lesser degree, we also use borrowings, primarily FHLBNY advances and brokered deposits, to supplement cash flow needs, as needed. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposit Accounts. The substantial majority of our deposits are from depositors who reside in our primary market area. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments for both individuals and businesses. At June 30, 2019, our deposits totaled $1.23 billion and included $77.5 million of brokered time deposits, as well as $40.1 million of municipal deposits.
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and services and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term.
 Borrowings. We primarily utilize advances from the FHLBNY to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLBNY functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLBNY and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLBNY’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At June 30, 2019, we had the ability to borrow up to $291.2 million with the FHLBNY and had $111.2 million in advances outstanding. All of our borrowings from the FHLBNY are secured by investment securities. At June 30, 2019, we also had an available line of credit with the 
 9


Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s (“FRB”) discount window program of $118.0 million, none of which was outstanding at that date. This line of credit is secured by certain qualifying 1-4 family residential mortgage loans.
 Personnel
 At June 30, 2019, we had 160 full-time and 22 part-time employees.
 Subsidiaries
 PCSB Bank is the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCSB Financial. PCSB Bank has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: PCSB Funding Corp. and UpCounty Realty Inc. PCSB Funding Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a real estate investment trust that holds certain mortgage assets. UpCounty Realty Inc., a New York corporation, holds title to real estate properties foreclosed upon by PCSB Bank.
Regulation and Supervision
 General 
 PCSB Bank is a New York-chartered commercial bank and the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCSB Financial, a Maryland corporation, which is a registered bank holding company. PCSB Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. PCSB Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the NYSDFS, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. PCSB Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the NYSDFS concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. PCSB Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. 
 As a registered bank holding company, PCSB Financial is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and NYSDFS. PCSB Financial is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. PCSB Financial is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is responsible for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators, and now has the authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as PCSB Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their federal prudential regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. 
 In addition to creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of tougher consolidated capital requirements on holding companies, required the issuance of regulations requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, imposed regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased our compliance costs and we expect that these costs will persist.

Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the NYSDFS, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, New York State or the U.S. Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of PCSB Financial and PCSB Bank. In addition, PCSB Financial and PCSB Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve Board. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of PCSB Financial and PCSB Bank. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to PCSB Bank and PCSB Financial. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations that are addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on PCSB Bank and PCSB Financial.
 New York Banking Laws and Supervision
 PCSB Bank, as a New York chartered commercial bank, is regulated and supervised by the NYSDFS, which is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the NYSDFS is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank and to undertake many other activities. Any New York commercial bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the NYSDFS may be sanctioned. The NYSDFS may suspend or remove directors or officers of a commercial bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the NYSDFS has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the commercial bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. 
 The powers that New York-chartered commercial banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
 Lending Activities. A New York-chartered commercial bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made according to applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 
 Deposit Powers. A New York chartered commercial bank may offer a variety of deposit products to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments and their agencies and departments, including checking, NOW, money market, savings, IRA and certificate of deposit accounts. Commercial banks may accept deposits at their branches and ATM’s and may also provide online and mobile deposit services as well as cash management services such as escrow, sweep and lockbox accounts.
 Investment Activities.  In general, PCSB Bank may invest in certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies), certain types of corporate equity securities and certain other assets. However, these investment authorities are constrained by federal law.  See “—Federal Bank Regulation—Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions. 
 Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Under the New York Banking Law, PCSB Bank’s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exceptions, 15% of its capital stock, surplus fund and undivided profits. The Bank’s lending limit as of June 30, 2019 was $32.3 million. PCSB Bank may lend additional amounts up to 10% if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At June 30, 2019, PCSB Bank complied with these loans-to-one-borrower limitations.  At June 30, 2019, PCSB Bank’s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was $31.4 million.
 Dividends. Under New York banking law, PCSB Bank is permitted to declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital.  Additionally, the approval of the NYSDFS is required if the total of 
 11


all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to certain adjustments provided for in the applicable law.
 Loans to Directors and Executive Officers. Under applicable NYSDFS regulations (which are substantially similar to applicable federal banking regulations), PCSB Bank generally may not make a loan or other extension of credit to any of its executive officers or directors unless the loan or other extension of credit (i) is made on terms, including interest rate and collateral, that are not more favorable to the executive officer or director than those customarily offered by PCSB Bank to persons who are not executive officers or directors and who are not employed by PCSB Bank, and (ii) does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Depending on the size of the loan or other extension of credit, prior approval of PCSB Bank’s Board of Directors (with the interested party, if a director, abstaining from participating directly or indirectly in the voting) may be required. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2019, we have made no loans to executive officers or directors.
 Assessments. As a New York state-chartered commercial bank, PCSB Bank is required to pay to the NYSDFS a general assessment fee in connection with the NYSDFS’ regulation and supervision (including examination) of PCSB Bank. Each state institution is billed five times per each fiscal year, with four estimated quarterly assessments set as approximately 25% of the annual amount based on the NYSDFS’ estimated annual budget at the time of the billing, and a final assessment, or “true-up,” based on the NYSDFS’ actual expenses for the fiscal year.  The FDIC does not charge a state bank for supervision, although as discussed below, it charges all insured depository institutions deposit insurance assessments in connection with its administration of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any New York bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the NYSDFS may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the commercial bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The NYSDFS may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the commercial bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the NYSDFS may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the commercial bank concerned.  New York consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to PCSB Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
 New York Legislation and Regulation. The New York State Legislature and the NYSDFS have adopted laws and regulations and issued guidance in a number of areas affecting PCSB Bank’s operations. These include:

• | The New York Legislature has enacted legislation to address "zombie properties", meaning residential property abandoned by a homeowner after the initiation, but prior to the completion of, a foreclosure proceeding. Under this law, a mortgagee bank has a duty to maintain and secure a residential real property where there is a reasonable basis to believe it is vacant and abandoned, and faces civil penalties up to $500 per violation, per property, per day for failing to do so. As enacted, the legislation does not apply to PCSB Bank because we originate, own, service and maintain our own mortgages and we originate less than 0.3 percent of one- to four-family real property mortgages in New York. However, there can be no assurance that any future amendments to this law will not include us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The NYSDFS has adopted a regulation that requires New York chartered banks to maintain programs to monitor and filter transactions for potential Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering violations and prevent transactions with sanctioned entities. The regulation requires regulated institutions annually to submit a board resolution or senior officer compliance finding confirming steps taken to ascertain compliance with the regulation. Under the regulation, banks are required to review their transaction-monitoring and filtering programs and ensure that they are reasonably designed to comply with risk-based safeguards. The institutions also must adopt (at the institution’s option) an annual board resolution or senior officer compliance finding to certify compliance with the regulation. The resolution or finding must state that documents, reports, certifications and opinions of officers and other relevant parties have been reviewed by the board of directors or senior official to certify compliance with the regulation.

• | The NYSDFS has adopted a regulation which requires New York chartered banks to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of the commercial bank. The regulation, which is similar to guidance issued by the federal bank regulators, requires regulated financial institutions to establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing its new program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by, third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. The regulation requires annual written certification of compliance to NYSDFS. We believe that our cybersecurity policies and procedures comply with the new regulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The NYSDFS has issued guidance regarding incentive compensation. The guidance prohibits the payment by New York chartered banks of incentive compensation tied to employee performance indicators, such as the number of accounts opened, or the number of products sold per customer, without effective risk management, oversight and control. Banks considering the adoption of such incentive compensation plans must balance between risks and rewards, emplace effective controls and risk management and have strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. We have and will continue to ensure that any incentive compensation plan we adopt will conform to this guidance. See “Management – Executive Compensation-Proposed Short-Term Incentive Plan”.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 New York has other statutes and regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below.
 Federal Bank Regulation
 Capital Requirements.  Under FDIC regulations, federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member banks”), such as PCSB Bank, are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements. The minimum leverage capital requirement is a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets that is not less than 4.0%. Tier 1 capital consists of “CET1” and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements. CET1 is defined as common stock, plus related surplus, and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less the majority of the regulatory deductions. 
 The FDIC regulations require state non-member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as a bank’s “risk-based capital ratio.” Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items (including recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes and residual interests) to risk-weighted categories ranging from 0% to 1,250%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. 
 State non-member banks must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, of which at least one-half must be Tier 1 capital. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings.  Under the new capital rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the new capital rules’ specific requirements. Banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk-based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk. 
 The FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a final rule that establishes a common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets), sets the leverage ratio at a uniform 4% of total assets and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised.  PCSB Bank has elected to exercise its one-time option to opt-out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain 
 13


“available-for-sale” securities holdings for purposes of calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” which, as fully phased in, consists of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The “capital conservation buffer” was phased in over a four-year period through January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the conservation buffer was fully phased in.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act requires each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Investment Activities. All state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including commercial banks, are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the FDIC’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by New York law, whichever is less. 
 In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act permits banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.  Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 Under FDIC regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and 
 14


a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. At June 30, 2019, PCSB Bank was classified as a “well capitalized” institution. 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, payment of dividends, and the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus.  Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% shareholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 15


Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state commercial banks, including PCSB Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” It may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.
Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. PCSB Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in PCSB Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
 The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under its risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by regulation, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 1 1/2 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate by more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC sought to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020, with the increase to be funded by insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. Upon reaching a fund ratio of 1.35% as of December 31, 2018, smaller institutions were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. As of March 31, 2019, the fund ratio was 1.36%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. It has recently exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of PCSB Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of PCSB Bank’s deposit insurance. 
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The last bonds issued by the FICO will mature in September 2019.
 Privacy Regulations. FDIC regulations generally require that PCSB Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, PCSB Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. PCSB Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.
 16


Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by FDIC, a state non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. PCSB Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
 New York has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA, which is applicable to PCSB Bank. New York law requires the NYSDFS to consider a bank’s record of performance under New York law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution.  PCSB Bank’s most recent rating under New York law was “Satisfactory.” 
 Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. New York commercial banks are subject to a variety of federal and New York statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. New York’s Attorney General has vigorously enforced fair lending and other consumer protection laws. The Dodd Frank Act added a new statute that prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FDIC and state Attorneys General. The Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York has stated that NYSDFS will vigorously enforce consumer protection laws to the extent that federal bank regulators reduce such enforcement.
 USA Patriot Act. PCSB Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by PCSB Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

• | Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose the terms and conditions of consumer credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to disclose the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process and prohibits specific practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations upon the use of escrow accounts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the New York Executive Law, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The deposit operations of PCSB Bank also are subject to, among others, the: 
  
• | Truth in Savings Act, which requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of their deposit accounts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expedited Funds Availability Act, which requires banks to make funds deposited in transaction accounts available to their customers within specified time frames;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New York banking laws and regulations, which governs deposit powers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Reserve System
 Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2019, the regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements.  PCSB Bank is in compliance with these requirements.  
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 PCSB Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.  Members of the FHLB are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. PCSB Bank complied with this requirement at June 30, 2019. Based on redemption provisions of the FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. PCSB Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLBNY stock. At June 30, 2019, no impairment has been recognized. 
 At its discretion, the FHLBNY may declare dividends on the stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for affordable housing programs, which could reduce the amount of dividends that the FHLB pay to their members and result in the FHLB imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. While the FHLBNY currently pays a dividend on its capital stock, there can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the FHLB also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLBNY stock held by PCSB Bank.

Holding Company Regulation 
 PCSB Financial, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over PCSB Financial and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank.
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. PCSB Financial has not elected to become a financial holding company.
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of PCSB Financial to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. 
 The status of PCSB Financial as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
 New York Holding Company Regulation.  PCSB Financial is subject to regulation under New York banking law. Among other requirements, PCSB Financial must receive the approval of the NYSDFS before acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of another banking institution, or to otherwise acquire a banking institution by merger or purchase.

Federal Securities Laws
 PCSB Financial’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PCSB Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 PCSB Financial qualifies as an emerging growth company under the The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion (adjusted for inflation) during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.”  
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold shareholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement.  Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. PCSB Financial has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a public company.
 PCSB Financial loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (ii) the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of the Company’s common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, which will be June 30, 2022; (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which it is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).
 Smaller Reporting Company Status
 PCSB Financial qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under the federal securities laws.  To qualify, a company must have a public float (i.e., aggregate market value of a company’s securities held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million.  A company with less than $100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float that is less than $700 million also qualifies.  Smaller reporting companies are eligible to provide scaled disclosures in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. PCSB Financial has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.

Change in Control Regulations
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as PCSB Financial unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with PCSB Financial, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
 Federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, under the New York Banking Law, for a period of three years following completion of a conversion to stock form, no person may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of equity security of a converting savings bank without prior written approval of NYSDFS.
 Taxation
 Federal Taxation
 General.  PCSB Financial and PCSB Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to PCSB Financial and PCSB Bank.
 Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which among other changes reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company was required to remeasure, through income tax expense, the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which the deferred items are expected to be recovered or settled. The remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset resulted in additional income tax expense of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, PCSB Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns.
 Minimum Tax. As a result of the aforementioned tax reform, the alternative minimum tax rate is reduced from 20% to 0% for all tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards from prior tax years can be applied to reduce future taxable income and are refundable, subject to certain limitations. At June 30, 2019, PCSB Bank had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, for federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry forward net operating losses indefinitely and are subject to a limitation of 80% of taxable income. State income tax rules may differ from federal rules. See Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Charitable Contributions Carryovers. Generally, charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income, however financial institutions may carryforward unused contributions for up to 5 years. At June 30, 2019 the Company has charitable contributions carryforwards totaling $2.7 million, for which we expect to fully realize the benefit. See Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the 
 21


year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any not deducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At June 30, 2019, PCSB Bank had no capital loss carryovers. 
 Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from PCSB Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. To date, no dividends have been paid by PCSB Bank.
 Audit of Tax Returns.  PCSB Bank’s federal income tax returns and various state income tax returns have not been audited in the last three years. 
 State Taxation
 Taxable income is apportioned to New York State based on the location of the taxpayer’s customers, with special rules for income from certain financial transactions. The location of the taxpayer’s offices and branches are not relevant to the determination of income apportioned to New York State. The statutory tax rate is currently 6.5%. An alternative tax of 0.05% on apportioned capital is imposed to the extent that it exceeds the tax on apportioned income. The New York State alternative tax is capped at $5 million for a tax year and is gradually phased out over a six-year period, becoming fully phased out beginning January 1, 2021. Thrift institutions that maintain a qualified residential loan portfolio are entitled to a specially computed modification that reduces the income taxable to New York State.
 The Company is also taxed in Connecticut and New Jersey, primarily as a result of income earned on loans where the borrower or the real estate collateral underlying the loan is located in these states.
