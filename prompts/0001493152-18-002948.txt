ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
Document Security Systems, Inc. (referred to in this report as “Document Security Systems”, “DSS”, “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company”) was formed in New York in 1984 and, in 2002, chose to strategically focus on becoming a developer and marketer of secure technologies. We specialize in fraud and counterfeit protection for all forms of printed documents and digital information. The Company holds numerous patents for optical deterrent technologies that provide protection of printed information from unauthorized scanning and copying. We operate two production facilities, consisting of a combined security printing and packaging facility and a plastic card facility where we produce secure and non-secure documents for our customers. We license our anti-counterfeiting technologies to printers and brand-owners. In addition, we have a digital division which provides cloud computing services for its customers, including disaster recovery, back-up and data security services. In 2013, the Company expanded its business focus by merging with DSS Technology Management, Inc., formerly known as Lexington Technology Group, Inc. (as described in greater detail below), which acquires intellectual property assets and interests in companies owning intellectual property assets for the purpose of monetizing these assets through a variety of value-enhancing initiatives, including, but not limited to, investments in the development and commercialization of patented technologies, licensing, strategic partnerships and litigation.
 
Prior to 2006, our primary revenue source in our document security division was derived from the licensing of our technology. In 2006, we began a series of acquisitions designed to expand our ability to produce products for end-user customers. In 2006, we acquired Plastic Printing Professionals, Inc. (“P3”), a privately held plastic cards manufacturer located in the San Francisco, California area. P3 is also referred to herein as the “DSS Plastics Group”. In 2008, we acquired DPI of Rochester, LLC, a privately held commercial printer located in Rochester, New York, referred to herein as “Secuprint” or “DSS Printing Group”. In 2010, we acquired Premier Packaging Corporation, a privately held packaging company located in Victor, New York. Premier Packaging Corporation is also referred to herein as “Premier Packaging” or the “DSS Packaging Group.” In May 2011, we acquired ExtraDev, Inc. a privately held information technology and cloud computing company located in Rochester, New York. In 2016, ExtraDev, Inc. changed its name to DSS Digital Inc. DSS Digital Inc. is also referred to herein as the “DSS Digital Group”.
 
On July 1, 2013, we merged with DSS Technology Management, Inc. (formerly known as Lexington Technology Group, Inc.), a private intellectual property monetization company. DSS Technology Management, Inc. is also referred to herein as “DSS Technology Management” or “DSSTM”. DSS Technology Management is focused on extracting the economic benefits of intellectual property assets through acquiring or internally developing patents or other intellectual property assets (or interests therein) and then monetizing such assets through a variety of value enhancing initiatives.
 
We do business in four operating segments as follows:
 
DSS Packaging and Printing Group - Produces custom paperboard packaging serving clients in the pharmaceutical, beverage, photo packaging, toy, specialty foods and direct marketing industries, among others. The group also provides secure and commercial printing services for end-user customers along with technical support for our technology licensees. The division produces a wide array of printed materials such as security paper, vital records, prescription paper, birth certificates, receipts, manuals, identification materials, entertainment tickets, secure coupons, parts tracking forms, brochures, direct mailing pieces, catalogs, business cards, etc. The division also provides resources and production equipment resources for our ongoing research and development of security printing and related technologies.
 
DSS Plastics Group - Manufactures laminated and surface printed cards which can include magnetic stripes, bar codes, holograms, signature panels, invisible ink, micro fine printing, guilloche patterns, biometric, radio frequency identification (RFID) and watermarks for printed plastic documents such as ID cards, event badges, and driver’s licenses.
 
DSS Digital Group - Provides data center centric solutions to businesses and governments delivered via the “cloud”. This division developed an iPhone based application that integrates some of our traditional optical deterrent technologies into proprietary digital data security based solutions for brand protection and product diversion prevention.
 
DSS Technology Management - Acquires or internally develops patented technology or intellectual property assets (or interests therein), with the purpose of monetizing these assets through a variety of value-enhancing initiatives, including, but not limited to, investments in the development and commercialization of patented technologies, licensing, strategic partnerships and commercial litigation.

Our Technology Management Business
 
Since its acquisition by the Company in 2013, DSS Technology Management’s primary mission has been the attempted monetization of its various patent portfolios through commercial litigation. The status of pending patent infringement lawsuits which have been filed by DSS Technology Management and the Company are more particularly described in Part 1, Item 3 of this Report.
 
DSS Technology Management and the Company have partnered with various third-party funding groups in connection with patent monetization programs and may continue to do so in the future.
 
In February 2014, DSS Technology Management entered into an agreement with certain investors to receive a series of advances up to $4,500,000 in exchange for promissory notes, fixed return interests and contingent interests collateralized by certain of DSS Technology Management’s intellectual property. On February 13, 2014, we received $2,000,000 under the agreement and on March 27, 2014, we received an additional $1,000,000 under the agreement. On September 5, 2014, we received the remaining $1,500,000 under the agreement. As of February 13, 2016, DSS Technology Management had failed to repay a portion of the $4,500,000 of advances as called for in the agreement, and therefore was in default for non-payment under the agreement. On December 2, 2016, the parties amended the February 2014 agreement for the purposes of vacating DSS Technology Management’s ongoing default and amending certain provisions of the original agreement (the “Amendment”). Under the Amendment, DSS Technology Management had until February 13, 2018 to satisfy the required payment terms under the February 2014 agreement, as amended. As additional consideration for this extension, DSS Technology Management agreed to (i) pay the investors an amount equal to 25% of any amounts it receives for monetization activities related to certain patents covering systems and methods of using low power peripheral devices (collectively, the “BlueTooth Patents”) until the investors have received payments totaling $4,500,000 plus additional capitalized expenses of $150,000, (ii) provide the investors with additional security interests in certain of its semiconductor patents, and (iii) deposit the sum of $600,000 over a two-year period into a separate cash collateral account to be utilized for pursuing related patent monetization activities and for payment of certain qualifying business expenses of DSS Technology Management. On February 13, 2018, the Maturity Date, DSS Technology Management failed to pay the Investors an amount equal to (x) two times the aggregate amount of all Advances made by the Investors as of such date plus (y) the Capitalized Expenses, which was an Event of Default under the February 2014 agreement, as amended. The sole recourse available to the Investors under the February 2014 agreement, as amended, is the establishment of a special purpose entity controlled by the Investors which would take ownership of the Collateral consisting of the patents covered under the February 2014 agreement, as amended. Each of the Investors and the Collateral Agent have contractually agreed that they will not, individually or collectively, seek to enforce any monetary judgment with respect to or against any assets of the Company other than the Patents and the Monetization Payments and the remaining Deposit. The Investors and the Collateral Agent have not taken any action as of the date of this Report to take ownership of the Collateral.
 
On November 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Proceeds Investment Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Brickell Key Investments LP (“BKI”). Pursuant to the Agreement, BKI financed an aggregate of $13,500,000 in a patent purchase and monetization program to be implemented and managed by the Company (the “Financing”). Pursuant to the Agreement, $3,000,000 of the Financing was used to cover the Company’s purchase of a portfolio of U.S. and foreign LED patents and a license from Intellectual Discovery Co., Ltd., a Korean company (collectively, the “LED Patent Portfolio”), and $6,000,000 of the Financing was directed by BKI to attorneys to cover those attorneys’ fees and out-of-pocket expenses for legal proceedings that may transpire relating to enforcement of the LED Patent Portfolio. In addition, the Company received $4,500,000 of the Financing which is required to be used by the Company to pay for the defense of Inter Partes Review or other similar proceedings that may be filed from time to time by defendants with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office relating to the LED Patent Portfolio, with excess amounts available for general working capital needs.
 
In consideration of its portion of the Financing, the Company assigned to BKI its rights to the Patent Asset Proceeds, defined as any and all monetary recoveries (whether through damages, recoveries, royalties, monies, lump-sum payments, up-front payments, settlement amounts, distribution of property, cash value of equities, license fees or other revenues or other assets or amounts) paid by a defendant or defendants or a third-party to the Company as a result of or in connection with the LED Patent Portfolio, in an amount equal to the Minimum Return and the Additional Return as hereinafter defined (the “Assigned Rights”). Under the Assigned Rights, in addition to repayment in full of the Financing, the Company will pay BKI, solely from realized Patent Asset Proceeds, a return equal to the sum of (A) a certain multiple of the Financing or a designated annualized IRR Return on the Financing, whichever is greater (the “Minimum Return”), plus (B) and additional designated percentage of the Patent Asset Proceeds net of the Minimum Return (the “Additional Return”). Once the Minimum Return and Additional return to BKI are satisfied, Intellectual Discovery Co., Ltd. will be entitled to a payment of a certain percentage of the Patent Asset Proceeds with the remaining balance of Patent Asset Proceeds to be retained by the Company. In addition to the above consideration, the Company also issued to BKI a five-year warrant to purchase up to 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.

Our Core Products, Technology and Services 
 
Our core business is counterfeit prevention, brand protection and validation of authentic print media, including government-issued documents, packaging, ID cards and licenses. We believe we are a leader in the research and development of optical deterrent technologies and have commercialized these technologies with a suite of products that offer our customers an array of document security solutions. We provide document security technology to security printers, corporations, consumer product companies, and governments for protection of vital records and documents, certifications, travel documents, consumer products, pharmaceutical packaging and school transcripts.
 
Optical deterrent features such as ours are utilized mainly by large security printers for the protection of important printed documents, such as vital records, and identification documents. Many of these features, such as micro-printing, were developed pre-1980 as they were designed to be effective on the imaging devices of the day which were mainly photography mechanisms. With the advent of modern day scanners, digital copiers, digital cameras and easy to use imaging software such as Adobe Photoshop many of the pre-1980 optical deterrents such as micro-printing are no longer used or are much less effective in the prevention of counterfeiting.
 
Unlike some of our competitors, our technologies are developed to defeat today’s modern imaging systems. Almost all of our products and processes are built to thwart scanners and digital copiers and we believe that our products are the most effective in doing so in the market today. In addition, our technologies do not require expensive hardware or software add-ons to authenticate a document, but instead require simple, inexpensive hand-held readers which can be calibrated to particular hidden design features. Our technologies are literally ink on paper that is printed with a particular method to hide selected things from a scanner’s “eye” or distort what a scanner “sees.” These attributes make our anti-scanning technologies very cost effective versus other current offerings on the market since our technologies are imbedded during the normal printing process, thereby significantly reducing the costs to implement the technologies.
 
The Company’s primary anti-counterfeiting products and technologies are marketed under its AuthentiGuard® registered trademark.
 
In October 2012, the Company introduced AuthentiGuard®, an iPhone application for authentication, targeted to major Fortune 500 companies worldwide. The application is a cloud-enabled solution that permits efficient and cost-effective authentication for packaging, documents and credentials. The solution embeds customizable, covert AuthentiGuard® Prism technology that resists duplication on copiers and scanners in a product’s packaging. Product verification using a smartphone application creates real-time, accurate authentication results for brand owners that can be integrated into existing information systems.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Patents 
 
Our ability to compete effectively depends largely upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. During our development, we have expended significant resources on research and development in an effort to become a market leader with the ability to provide our customers effective solutions against an ever- changing array of counterfeit risks. Our position in the security print market is based on our technologies and products. We dedicate two staff members to research and development of print technologies, digital graphic files, and printing techniques to allow us to expand our ability to combat a wide variety of counterfeiting and brand protection issues. In 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $106,000 and $435,000 respectively, on research and development which is comprised mainly of compensation costs, materials and consultants, including stock-based payments to consultants. Research and development costs decreased during 2017 as compared to 2016 as the Company moved some personnel from research and development to program support to meet the requirements of current and prospective customers of the Company’s AuthentiGuard® product line.
 
We own patents covering semiconductor, light emitting diode, anti-counterfeiting and document authentication, and wireless peripheral technologies, respectively. We also have several patent applications in process, including provisional and Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications in various jurisdictions including the United States, Canada, and Europe. These applications cover our anti-counterfeiting technologies, including our AuthentiGuard® On-Demand and ADX, AuthentiGuard® Prism™, AuthentiGuard® Phantom™, AuthentiGuard® Survivor 21™, AuthentiGuard® VeriGlow™ products, and several other anti-counterfeiting and authentication technologies in development. Our issued patents have remaining durations ranging from 1 to 17 years.

Trademarks
 
We have registered our “AuthentiGuard®” mark, as well as our “Survivor 21®” electronic check icon and “VeriGlow®” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A trademark application is pending in Canada for “AuthentiGuard.” AuthentiGuard® is registered in several European countries including the United Kingdom. We have also applied to register AuthentiSite TM, AuthentiShare TM, AuthentiSuiteTM, AuthentiBlockTM, and AuthentiChainTM in the U.S.
Websites 
 
The primary website we maintain is www.dsssecure.com, which describes our company, our company history, our patented document security solutions, our major product offerings, and our targeted vertical markets. The website provides detailed product offerings of each of our divisions – Printing/ Packaging, Plastics and Digital. In addition, we maintain the website www.protectedpaper.com, an e-commerce site that markets and sells our patented security paper, hand-held security verifiers and custom security documents to end users worldwide. In addition to the active websites, the Company owns several other domain names reserved for future use or for strategic competitive reasons.
Markets and Competition 
 
The security print market is comprised of a few very large companies and an increasing number of small companies with specific technology niches. The expansion of this market is primarily due to the fact that counterfeiting has expanded significantly as advancing technologies in digital duplication and scanning combined with increasingly sophisticated design software has enabled easier reproduction of original documents, vital records and IDs, packaging, and labels. Our competitors include Standard Register Company, which specializes in printing security technologies for the check and forms and medical industries; and De La Rue Plc, that specializes in printing secure currency, tickets, labels, lottery tickets and vital records for governments and Fortune 500 companies. Large office equipment manufacturers, called OEMs, such as Sharp, Xerox, Canon, Ricoh, Hewlett Packard and Eastman Kodak are developing “smart copier” technology that recognizes particular graphical images and produces warning words or distorted copies. Some of the OEMs are also developing user assigned and variable pantograph “hidden word” technologies in which users can assign a particular hidden word in copy, such as “void” that is displayed when a copy of such document is made. In addition, other competing hidden word technologies are being marketed by competitors such as NoCopi Technologies which sells and markets secure paper products, and Graphic Security Systems Corporation, which markets Scrambled Indicia.
 
Our packaging division competes with a significant number of national, regional and local companies, many of which are independent and privately-held. The largest competitors in this market are primarily focused on the long-run print order market. They include large integrated paper companies such as Rock-Tenn Company, Caraustar Industries, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company and Mead Westvaco. Our printing division competes primarily with locally-based printing companies in the Rochester and Western New York markets. Most of our competitors in these markets are privately-held, single location operations.
 
Our plastics division competes with several companies including Bristol ID, AbNote (formerly Arthur Blanks), LaserCard Corporation and L-1 Identity Solutions. The plastics division primarily delivers its products through a dealer network, but also provides products to end-user customers. Competition in the plastic card industry is primarily based on production capabilities based on specialized equipment, geographic location, quality and service. In addition, competition is increasingly influenced by proprietary or niche offerings provided by competitors, such as RFID, biometric, read-write, and security features built-into the plastic card.
 
Our technology division also faces competition in the area of patent acquisitions and enforcement. Entities such as Acacia, RPX, AST, Intellectual Ventures, Wi-LAN, MOSAID, Round Rock Research LLC, IPvalue Management Inc., Vringo Inc. and Pendrell Corporation compete in acquiring rights to patents.


Customers 
 
During 2017, two customers accounted for 46% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2017 these two customers accounted for 38% of the Company’s trade accounts receivable balance. During 2016, these same two customers accounted for 38% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2016, these two customers accounted for 31% of the Company’s trade accounts receivable balance.

Raw Materials 
 
The primary raw materials the Company uses in its businesses are paper, corrugated paperboard, plastic sheets, and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. Paper and paperboard prices continued to increase in 2017, and we believe increases in future years are expected. Except for certain packaging customers where the Company enters into annual contracts, for which changes in paperboard pricing is absorbed by the Company, the Company has historically passed substantially all increases and decreases to its customers, although there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to do so in the future.
Environmental Compliance


It is the Company’s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, it not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Government Regulation 
 
In light of the events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent ongoing war on terrorism, governments, private entities and individuals have become more aware of, and concerned with, the problems related to counterfeit documents. Homeland security remains a high priority in the United States. For example, in 2007, federal legislation was enacted that required hospitals, physicians and pharmacies to use tamperproof paper to fill all Medicaid prescriptions. The requirement, which was part 7002(b) of the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007”, was effective April 1, 2008.
 
We play an active role with the Document Security Alliance group, as one of our research and development management members sits on various committees of that group and has been involved in design recommendations for important U.S. documents. This group of security industry specialists was formed by the U.S. Secret Service to evaluate and recommend security solutions to the federal government for the protection of credentials and vital records.
 
Future legislation regarding anti-terrorism, counterfeiting or related areas could impact, possibly adversely, our counterfeit prevention, brand protection and validation business.
 
Our patent monetization business is also faced with potential government regulations. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our patent monetization efforts and, in turn, our assets, expenses and revenue. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“The America Invents Act”). The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities, such as our Company, on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could adversely impact our ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.
 
Moreover, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in 1984 and changed its name to Document Security Systems, Inc. in 2002. Since then, the Company has acquired a plastics card manufacturer, a printing company, a packaging company, an IT services company, and an intellectual property monetization company.
