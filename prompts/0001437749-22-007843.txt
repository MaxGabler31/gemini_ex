Item 1. | Description of Business.
--------+-------------------------

 
The use of the words “CVD,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to CVD Equipment Corporation, a New York corporation incorporated on October 13, 1982, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CVD Materials Corporation (including its wholly owned subsidiaries CVD Tantaline ApS, and CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation) collectively “CVD Materials”), FAE Holdings 411519R LLC and 555 N Research Corporation except where the context otherwise requires.
 
CVD has continued to serve the advanced materials markets with chemical vapor and thermal process equipment for over 38 years. Our products are used in research and development centers as well as in production environments. We develop, design, manufacture and service a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other state-of-the-art process equipment and solutions used in advanced materials and coatings. We serve markets ranging from academic/research initiatives to industrial applications. With the adoption of our technology in these markets we see increased usage of our systems across production environments. Major target markets for our business include advanced nanomaterials, batteries and Silicon Carbide for high power electronics; aerospace gas turbine engines and structural components; medical devices (such as implants); advanced semiconductor devices and Silicon for solar cells; and carbon nanotubes and nanowires. Our Application Laboratory supports the development of new material systems and processes. Our CVD Materials group provides material coating services, process development support and process startup assistance with the focus on enabling tomorrow’s technologiesTM. Our Mesoscribe product line continues to support the aerospace and defense markets with robust direct write instrumentation. Our CVD Tantaline subsidiary which underwent a restructuring and consolidation in 2021 provides chemical-resistant coating services to many industrial applications.
 
   
  

Based on more than 38 years of experience, we use our capabilities in process development, engineering and vertical manufacturing to transform new applications into mainstream manufacturing solutions. We have built a significant library of design expertise, know-how and innovative solutions to assist our customers in developing these intricate processes and to accelerate their production and commercialization. This library of equipment design solutions, along with our manufacturing and systems integration facilities, allows us to provide application-specific design, process and manufacturing solutions to our customers.
 
To expand our presence into various growth markets, we are developing a line of proprietary standard use products to complement our customized legacy systems. Historically, we manufactured products for research and development on an application-specific basis to meet an individual customer’s specific research and production requirements. Our proprietary systems leverage the technological expertise that we have developed through designing these custom systems into a broader standardized product line. The standard product line is easily configured from a wide range of available options to meet diverse product and budgetary requirements. Manufacturing these standardized systems in higher volumes provides us the flexibility to reduce both the cost and delivery time of our systems. These systems, which we market and sell under the EasyTube® and CVD product lines, are sold to universities, research laboratories, and production companies in the United States and throughout the world.
 
Sales of our proprietary standard systems, custom systems and process solutions have been driven by our installed customer base, which includes Fortune 500 companies. The performance and success of our products has historically driven repeat orders from existing customers as well as generated business from new customers. Furthermore, with our proprietary solutions and expanded focus on “accelerating the commercialization of tomorrow’s technologies”TM we have been developing a new customer base in addition to growing with our existing customers. We have generally gained new customers through our industry reputation, as well as limited print advertising and trade show attendance (which has been negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, 2021 and into 2022).
 
Our core competencies in equipment and software design, manufacturing and process development are used to engineer our finished products and to accelerate the commercialization path of our customer base. Our proprietary real-time software allows for rapid configuration, and provides our customers with enabling tools to understand, optimize and repeatedly control their processes. These factors significantly reduce cost, improve quality and reduce the time it takes between customers’ orders and the shipment of our products. Our Application Laboratory allows customers the option to bring up their process tools in our Application Laboratory and to work collaboratively with our scientists and engineers to optimize process performance.
 

    3 

  

In 2021 our focus has been on our growth markets, the development of standard product solutions and being able to provide solutions from gas/liquid storage through process and process by-product treatment. This has allowed us to provide increased value to our customers.
 
2021 Developments
 
In January 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer (previously our Vice-President, Sales and Marketing) to, among other things, evaluate our business strategy and operations, and set a new course toward growth and profitability. Based on this evaluation, our Board concluded that our primary focus should be on bolstering our core equipment business. Furthermore, due to continued losses and the significant investments required to continue its present operations, we aim to revise the current strategy of our Materials business, potentially reallocating or ceasing existing elements entirely.  Based upon that analysis and planning, which included forecasted losses and negative cash flows for the Tantaline product line, we implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line. This resulted in a discontinuation of all US Tantaline operations, including the freezing of substantial capital investments and the consolidation of all Tantaline operations into the Denmark Tantaline facility. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, related to the long lived assets of Tantaline. With these actions completed, including the migration of all sales, operations and marketing to Denmark, and our focused customer support and increased demand for the Tantaline coating services, we are pleased with the favorable results achieved in 2021 including achieving profitability and positive cash flow at our Denmark Tantaline operations.
 
We continue to monitor the results of our growth and profitability initiatives, and we will take actions as required to improve our results in line with anticipated revenue levels. The 2021 company strategy to focus on growth market applications has yielded multi system orders in the Silicon Carbide wafer and Battery nanomaterial fields, both fields are essential for the support of the Electric Vehicles (EV) market. These orders will provide us with standard product to continue to support the EV focused market as well as all energy storage and power transmission. We continue to engage customers in the aerospace market in what we believe will be an eventual recovery in air travel and therefor gas turbine engine components which we provide production solutions and have a considerable installed base of systems.
 
During 2021, new order bookings exceeded $21 million, representing an increase of approximately 75% compared to 2020. We have achieved order growth in all segments, including a 100% growth in the CVD equipment portion of the business, with 23 system orders in 2021. Our order rate has also increased in the SDC Division and CVD Materials Division which includes the Tantaline and MesoScribe product lines. As a result of increased new orders primarily in the last three quarters of 2021, the result of a recovery in the marketplace, excluding aerospace, as well as our execution of our operating plan, we have achieved four sequential quarters of revenue growth during 2021. Quarterly revenue in 2021 was $3.4 million, $4.0 million, $4.3 million and $4.7 million, during Q1 to Q4, respectively.
 
    4 

  

Our order rate has benefited from the increased demand for nanotechnology materials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), Graphene and silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) to support development and manufacturing for battery materials used in electric vehicles. CVD received two system orders in 2021 to deposit coatings onto powders used in silicon-graphite anodes, including a production system and a second for research and material development. Both systems are planned to ship in the middle of 2022.
 
In addition, demand for Silicon Carbide wafers to support high power electronics for energy storage and transmission/charging has resulted in a multi system order from a US-based, Silicon Carbide wafer provider for approximately $2 million. The systems are scheduled to be delivered in 2022.
 
CVD is also a leading manufacturer of Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) and Tow-Coating Systems to manufacture ceramic composite materials (CMCs) for Aerospace gas turbine engine applications. Even though the aerospace industry has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, according to industry forecasts, the demand for increased manufacturing is anticipated to recover in 2023.
 
All of these business growth opportunities are consistent with our strategic plan to address and serve growth production markets.
 
During February 2021, in order to increase our liquidity and to provide necessary working capital to support our on-going business and operations, the Board decided to sell its facility located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “555 Building”). On March 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Steel K, LLC for the sale of the 555 Building, and on July 26, 2021 we closed on the sale of the 555 Building. The sale price was $24,360,000, subject to adjustment for apportionments, adjustments and credits. A portion of the sale proceeds were used to satisfy the existing mortgage debt on the 555 Building, including interest and fees, in the amount of $9,352,719, as well as various costs related to the closing of the transaction. We recognized a gain on the sale of the building in the amount of $6,894,109 and received approximately $14,000,000 in net proceeds.
 
Management determined the 555 Building was not needed for its on-going business operations and concluded that any remaining elements of the Materials Business could be consolidated into its remaining facility in Central Islip (the “355 Building”), which we believe can accommodate our growth-related needs for the foreseeable future. In April 2021, we completed the transfer of our United States Tantaline equipment to the 355 Building, while the MesoScribe consolidation into the 355 Building was completed during Q3 2021. All functions of the Tantaline product line have been consolidated into the Denmark facility and, the expenses related to Tantaline operations in the United States have ceased.
 
In April 2021, we filed an application for forgiveness on our Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) loan and on June 14, 2021 we received a notification from our lender that on June 10, 2021 the SBA approved our PPP Loan forgiveness application and remitted payment to the lender for the entire principal amount of the PPP Loan and accrued interest. As a result, we recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 a gain on debt extinguishment in the amount of $2,443,418.

Principal Materials Products
 
Quartz-ware: All process equipment, especially systems in production/manufacturing environments, require routine maintenance, consumable and spare parts. One such spare part and consumable which is core to our technology offering is quartz hardware. We provide standard and custom fabricated quartz-ware used in our equipment and to a lesser extent for other customer tools. We also provide repair and replacement of existing quartz-ware. The business volume is favorably impacted by our CVD/First Nano systems being in production/manufacturing environments.
 
MesoPlasma™ Direct Write Printing: A materials deposition process that provides robust high definition instrumentation, fine feature patterns, and coatings onto conformal components. Powder materials are injected into a thermal plasma where they are rapidly heated and deposited onto the substrate or component. A 6-axis robotic system ensures pattern placement accuracy and manufacturing consistency. The versatility of the process enables a wide range of materials to be deposited including ceramic dielectrics, nickel-based sensor alloys, metallic conductors, precious metals, and protective coatings. Products include temperature sensors, heaters, antennas and patterns per customer specifications.
 
Tantaline® Corrosion Resistant Coating: Tantaline® treatment is provided as part of either a finished product or as a service applied to customer sourced components. These include valves, fittings, fasteners, vessels, bellows, and a wide range of custom designed items. The Tantaline® treatment drastically improves the corrosion resistance of these base stainless-steel parts extending the service life and increasing value in a wide range of applications.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
We serve multiple emerging and mature global markets including aerospace, defense, biomedical implants, microelectronic and micromechanical devices, semiconductor, universities and research centers. Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we believe it is essential to contact customers directly through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors specializing in the type of equipment, products and services that we sell. In addition to our traditional customer base, we are now accessing new markets and new customers through MesoScribe® and other components of our materials business.

Customers
 
In 2021, with the management restructuring of the company, we increased our customer engagement efforts with key industrial and research customers. The result of the increased engagement was a 100% year -over -year increase in CVD equipment systems orders. We continue to work on expanding our product and service offerings. Our systems and products are used in both advanced materials research and in production applications. We market and sell primarily to aerospace/defense, electronic component manufacturers, institutions involved in electronic component research (such as universities, government and industrial laboratories) and to industries such as medical that require specialized coatings. We have both a domestic and international customer base with hundreds of installed systems.
 
Given the complexity of some of the systems we sell, revenue from a single customer in any one year can exceed 10.0% of our total sales. There were no customers in fiscal year 2021 that exceeded 10% of our revenues, while two customers represented 30.5% of our annual revenues in fiscal year 2020. We believe that our relationships with these customers are positive and may provide us with ongoing continuous sustainability for years to come, however the loss of a large customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $4.3 million or 26.0% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S., compared to approximately $2.8 million or 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Warranties
 
Warranties on our equipment are typically for twelve months but can range up to twenty-four months from shipment with extended contracts. We furnish any warranties from original manufacturers of components used in our products. We provide service and support for our installed base of equipment with in-house field service personnel. Warranty costs, including those incurred in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, are and have been historically insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Competition
 
We can experience intense direct competition from both domestic and international competitors in all of our equipment segments. Our First Nano product line, targeted at universities and introductory sites, faces price pressure from lower value-added competitors. Our MesoScribe operations, which is in the adoption phase, faces barriers from established indirect competitors of existing solution providers. We are aware of other competitors that offer a substantial number of products and services comparable to ours. Many of our competitors (including customers who may elect to manufacture systems for internal use) have financial, marketing and other resources greater than our own. To date, we believe that each of our product and service segments has been able to compete favorably in markets that include these competitors, primarily on the basis of know-how, technical performance, quality, delivery, price and aftermarket support. We will continue to focus on products which serve markets that are growing and where we have a technical and commercially competitive advantage.

CVD/First Nano competes with companies located in Asia, Europe and the US in the research market. These companies have limited support and safety and system design capabilities. For the academia market, we also compete with laboratory built systems. Our equipment for production applications competes with in-house design and engineering capability and the capacity to build their own equipment internally. Additionally, there are large, established companies who compete with us and pose a competitive risk in the market. Due to budgetary and funding constraints, many customers are price sensitive. We believe that our systems are among the most advanced available for the targeted market, and coupled with our vertical integration in engineering and manufacturing, we can be very competitive.
 
SDC’s gas management and chemical delivery control systems are among the most advanced available. We further believe that SDC is differentiated from our competitors through our intimate understanding of how the systems in which our products are incorporated are actually used in field applications. We have gained this understanding as a result of having designed and built complex process gas systems for CVD/First Nano as well as for a number of the world’s leading semiconductor, aerospace, medical, solar manufacturers, research laboratories and universities.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Many of the components used in producing our products are purchased from unrelated suppliers. We have OEM status with our suppliers but we are not obligated to purchase a pre-determined quantity. We are not dependent on a principal or major supplier and alternate suppliers are available. Historically, subject to lead times, the components and raw materials we used in manufacturing our products were readily obtainable. Presently, a majority of our suppliers have been adversely impacted by the ongoing supply chain disruptions due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia.
 
Currently we maintain a fully-equipped machine shop that we use to fabricate a significant portion of our metal components in-house, including the most intricately designed parts of our equipment. Similarly, our quartz fabrication capability is sufficient to meet our quartz-ware needs.
 
Materials procured from the outside and/or manufactured internally undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that the parts meet or exceed our requirements and those of our customers. Upon final assembly, all equipment undergoes a final series of complete testing to ensure maximum product performance.
 
Backlog 
 
As of December 31, 2021, our order backlog was approximately $10.4 million, compared to $5.7 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.7 million. While the negative effect of COVID-19 crisis continues to impact the aerospace industry, due to reduced travel and reduction of industry gas turbine engine sales, we have achieved increased new orders during the quarters ended June, September and December 2021 in the amounts of $6.0 million, $6.1 million and $5.2 million. This resulted in the increased backlog at December 31, 2021. Aerospace sales have represented as much as 60% of our total revenue. We continue to work at diversifying our customer base away from any one customer as we focus on new opportunities with new and existing customers within our existing marketplaces and in new applications. The timing for completion of backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be as long as two years or as short as 30-60 days. Order backlog is usually a reasonable management tool to indicate expected revenues, however, it does not provide an assurance of future achievement or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our success is dependent, in part upon the development and protection of our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how through the use of patents and non-disclosure agreements. In the area of patents, we see value in having protected intellectual property and will continue to file for patent protection of our proprietary technology that we believe has the potential to be incorporated into our products and sold to multiple customers.  We also maintain and/or assert rights in certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines, and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
 
While patent, copyright and trademark protections for our intellectual property are important to different degrees for our various products and solutions, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel and our ability to accelerate the commercialization of next generation intellectual properties. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and other security measures.
 
Research and Development
 
Our Application Laboratory, together with a number of leading universities and startup companies with whom we partner from time to time, conducts cutting-edge research on the growth and infiltration of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires as well as on selected aerospace manufacturing processes. The results of this research could have far reaching implications concerning the use and manufacture of carbon nanotubes, graphene, nanowires and aerospace coatings for many markets. Our intention is that together with leading edge universities and start-up companies and major aerospace/defense companies, we will leverage our collective expertise in this field, which we believe will allow us to capitalize on commercial opportunities in the future.
 
In 2021, we incurred approximately $481,000 in research and development expenses as compared to $373,000 in 2020.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations, such as environmental, COVID-19 compliance, labor and export control. We believe that we have obtained all necessary permits to operate our business and that we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us. These regulations change on an ongoing basis and the effect of these changes could materially impact our business in certain technology areas and regions.
 
    11 

  

Utilizing our in-house safety team, engineering expertise and consultants as required, we continue to monitor and comply with applicable Environmental Health and Safety regulations at our facilities as well as the installation of equipment at our customer facilities.
 
With respect to our sales to customers located in China or elsewhere outside the United States, products which (i) are manufactured in the United States, (ii) incorporate controlled U.S. origin parts, technology, or software, or (iii) are based on U.S. technology, are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). We continue to monitor, review and maintain ongoing compliance with EAR with respect to our export sales.
 
Insurance
 
Our products are used in our customers’ manufacturing processes, which in some cases contain explosive, flammable, corrosive and toxic gases. There are potential exposures to personal injury as well as property damage, particularly if operated without regard to the design limits of the systems and components. Additionally, the end products of some of our customers are used in areas such as aerospace and high-tech devices where safety is of great concern. Management reviews its insurance coverage on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate and we believe we have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that are sufficient for our business.
Human Capital Resources
 
At December 31, 2021, we had 113 employees. We had 61 employees in manufacturing, 21 in engineering (including research and development and efforts related to product improvement) 3 in field service, 8 in sales and marketing and 20 in general management, maintenance and administration, compared to 130 employees as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We generally consider our employee relations to be good.
 
The implementation of our business strategy largely depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain qualified and diverse professionals, and we must emphasize employee development and training in order to do so. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of managers and intend to establish a strong succession planning program for our critical positions, including internships for technical and engineering resources from local universities. Moreover, a key strategic focus of our new management team is to foster and maintain a strong and healthy culture, where collaboration to achieve results and focus on the success of our customers and shareholders is paramount.
 
    12 

  

Employee Compensation
 
In addition, our new management undertook and continues to review our employee compensation programs to better align the compensation of our employees with our performance and personal performance, and to provide the proper short-term and long-term incentives to attract, retain and motivate them to achieve superior results. We believe we must offer wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience and knowledge, and in order to do so we may work with a nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive and non-executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within our industry.
Employee Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees and partners is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. We maintain strong environmental, health and safety protocols that focus on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self audits to ensure our colleagues and partners leave the workplace safely on a daily basis. Our safety focus is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included:

● | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


● | adjusting attendance policy is to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
