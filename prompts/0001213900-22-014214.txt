Item 1. Business Overview



Ipsidy Inc. dba authID.ai (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “authID.ai”, “we” or “our”)  is a leading provider of secure, mobile, biometric identity verification software products delivered by an easy to integrate Identity as a Service (IDaaS) platform. Our mission is ultimately to eliminate all passwords and to be the preferred global platform for biometric identity authentication. Our vision is to enable every organization to “Recognise Your Customer” instantly, without friction or loss of privacy, powered by the most sophisticated biometric and artificial intelligence technologies.




The explosive growth in online and mobile commerce, telemedicine, remote working and digital activities of all descriptions is self-evident to everyone who lived through the Covid 19 pandemic since 2020. Identity theft, phishing attacks, spear-phishing, password vulnerabilities, account takeovers, benefits fraud - it seems like these words have entered our daily lexicon overnight. These are significant impediments to the operations and growth of any business or organization, and dealing with the risks and consequences of these criminal activities has created significant friction in both time, cost and lost opportunity. Consider all the outdated methods that organizations have implemented in order to prevent fraud. The requests to receive and enter one-time passwords, that can be easily hijacked. The vulnerable security questions you get asked – whether on-line or when reaching out to a call center – what was your first pet’s name? who was your best friend in high school? These steps all add up to friction, making it difficult for consumers to login, transact and execute daily tasks, with little added protection from fraud. Surely there is a better way to address these challenges? authID.ai believes there is.



authID.ai provides secure, facial biometric, identity verification, and strong customer authentication. We maintain a global, cloud-based IDaaS platform for our enterprise customers to enable their users to easily verify and authenticate their identity through a mobile device or desktop (with camera) of their choosing (without requiring dedicated hardware, or authentication apps). We can help our customers establish a proven identity, creating a root of trust that ensures the highest level of assurance for our passwordless login and step-up verification products. Our system enables participants to consent to transactions using their biometric information with a digitally signed authentication response, embedding the underlying transaction data and each user’s identity attributes within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform.



Digital transformation across all market segments requires trusted identity. Our identity platform offers innovative solutions that are flexible, fast and easy to integrate and offer seamless user experiences. authID’s products help advance digital transformation efforts without the fear of identity fraud, while delivering frictionless user experiences. We believe that it is also essential that electronic transactions have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the individual was duly authenticated. Our platform provides biometric and multi-factor identity software, which are intended to establish, authenticate and verify identity across a wide range of use cases and electronic transactions.



authID’s products focus on the broad requirement for enabling frictionless commerce by allowing an entity to instantly “Recognise their Customer”. Organizations of all descriptions require cost-effective and secure means of growing their business while mitigating identity fraud. We aim to offer our enterprise customers products that can be integrated easily into each of their business and organizational operations, in order to facilitate their adoption and enhance the end user customer experience.



Our management believes that some of the advantages of our IDaaS Platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products requiring cost-effective, secure, and configurable mobile solutions. Our target markets include banking, fintech and other disrupters of traditional commerce, small and medium sized businesses, and system integrators working with government and Fortune 1000 enterprises. At its core, the Company’s offering, combining its proprietary and acquired biometric and artificial intelligence technologies (or AI), is intended to facilitate frictionless commerce, whether in the physical or digital world. The Company intends to increase its investment in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance the platform, which are intended to allow us to achieve our goals. One of the principal intended areas of investment is to enhance and expand our use of artificial intelligence in proprietary software, that we believe will increase our value to enterprise customers and stockholders alike.

Global Market Opportunity



The disruption caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic since 2020 has contributed significantly to several market trends driving growth and demand for stronger, more secure identity verification and authentication solutions and services such as those authID.ai provides. A key trend is the accelerated pace of digital transformation at the enterprise level, driven largely by the increased demands for online goods and sharing-economy services by consumers, The shift to working from home, and the remote IT challenges this lifestyle change presents is also driving opportunities for strong workforce identity and application access authentication. Today, even as companies begin to announce return to work policies, data show that millions of workers will continue to work remotely, a long-term shift that will require enhanced security across many industry sectors.



Unfortunately, the increase in remote work and digital, non-face-to-face commerce has also resulted in increased fraud, phishing scams and cyber security risks. These trends, as well as increased regulation mandates by governments, whether Federal, State, local or international, are key drivers of the need for improved processes to verify and authenticate identities.




Digital Transformation



Digital transformation, or the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, is fundamentally changing how organizations operate and deliver value to customers. The global disruption of the last two years dramatically increased the need for organizations to be more agile to meet changing markets, evolving technology and consumer demands. According to IBM research, more than 60% of surveyed executives are using this period of change to rapidly advance their enterprise’s transformation. (IBM Institute for Business Value “Digital Transformation Report” 2021) A McKinsey Global Survey of executives found that companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years (McKinsey, October 2020). According to Statista, spending on digital transformation in 2022 will reach $1.8 trillion, growing to $2.8 trillion by 2025. Statista also forecasts that as much as 65% of the world’s gross domestic product will be digitalized by 2022. (Statista “Spending on digital transformation technologies and services worldwide from 2017 to 2025” 2022).



Digital and mobile technologies have significantly changed people’s lives in a remarkably short time, including how we work, shop, socialize and bank. Escalating increases in mobile application downloads for digital goods and services by even the most reluctant consumers, dramatically altered service delivery across broad market segments, creating lasting effects that we believe are likely to stay.



Enterprises that were able to, scrambled to reduce reliance on physical outlets and to drive customers to remote digital channels offering seamless and secure user experiences. Electronic services—from mobile banking to online grocery shopping to tele-medicine—have increased multifold within the past year.



Key to realizing digital transformation goals and driving revenue growth is collaborative trust between buyers and sellers delivered through a positive user experience (UX). Strong identity assurance that is established from day one and spans the entire customer online or in-person journey ensures that service providers and consumers, employers and employees that operate within the digital economy are who they say they are. Efficient and reliable identity assurance, reduces friction and improves user experience in the process.



MarketsandMarkets, the B2B research firm, projects that the global digital identity solutions market will grow from $23 billion in 2021 to $49.5 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 16.3%. The company attributes this significant growth to the increase in identity-related frauds and data breaches, as well as compliance with existing and upcoming regulations. The firm further predicts that the market for digital identity and document verification services, a subset of the digital identity market, offers significant potential for growth opportunities, with revenues to rise to US$15.8 billion by 2025. (MarketsandMarkets “Digital Identity Market” 2020 and “Identity Verification Market” 2020).

Forrester Research has stated that the average help desk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70. (Forrester Research “Best Practices: Selecting, Deploying, And Managing Enterprise Password Managers” 2018) Forrester Research determined that large organizations spend up to $1 million per year on staffing and infrastructure to handle password resets alone. Passwords are the leading cause of major security breaches and Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach report estimates that over 80% of breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords. The ability to eliminate the need for passwords by enabling the consumer to easily and securely authenticate with their own biometrics represents a significant cost savings opportunity across all industries.



Remote Working



Over the last two years, the pandemic’s stay-at-home mandates accelerated the transition to remote and hybrid work across many industries. According to the Pew Research Institute, roughly six-in-ten U.S. workers who say their jobs can mainly be done from home are working from home all or most of the time. This compares to the 23% who say they teleworked frequently before the coronavirus outbreak. (Pew Research Center “COVID-19 Pandemic Continues To Reshape Work in America” Feb 2022 ).With workers’ preferences for flexibility, companies are adapting their operations to meet the IT, security and mobility needs of a workforce that may never fully return to the traditional office setting. According to estimates by Gartner Inc, remote workers will represent 32% of all employees worldwide by the end of 2021, almost doubling in two years from 17% of employees in 2019. Gartner also estimates that 51% of all knowledge workers- those involved in knowledge-intensive occupations, such as writers, accountants, or engineers will be working remotely at least one day a week by the end of 2021, (Gartner, “Gartner Forecasts 51% of Global Knowledge Workers Will Be Remote by the End of 2021”, 2021 ). 




While remote, decentralized teams can boost morale and productivity, remote work can also increase opportunities for hackers to infiltrate corporate networks. Enterprise IT organizations must now address new IT requirements and cyber challenges generated in the work from home environment. Studies have also shown that employees are more likely be distracted when working from home and more susceptible to phishing scams. According to  Equifax, cyber-attacks are much more likely to occur through mundane errors like a user choosing an easy-to-guess password or not changing the default password on something like a router.



To meet the increased enterprise security and mobility needs of this expanded remote workforce, IT decision makers are reassessing their data protection strategies in an effort to secure these remote workers and protect company assets. While IT continues to drive password hygiene through security training sessions, we believe legacy tools like one-time pin codes and knowledge-based authentication are no longer effective in mitigating risks. 



The result is increased demand for next-generation biometric authentication technology and a greater urgency to transform quickly. According to Ranjit Atwal, Senior Research Director at Gartner, “Through 2024, organizations will be forced to bring forward digital business transformation plans by at least five years. Those plans will have to adapt to a post-COVID-19 world that involves permanently higher adoption of remote work and digital touchpoints



The Increase in Identity Fraud



Unfortunately, with this increased demand for online services, remote working and digital convenience, organizations also face another proliferating challenge – the need to improve cybersecurity measures. We believe that never before, have criminals been so active in using stolen data or credential-stuffing attacks in attempts to infiltrate corporate networks.





According to Statista, over 11,000 data breaches have occurred in the United States since 2005 with more than 1.7 billion individual records breached (Statista “Annual number of data breaches and exposed records in the United States from 2005 to 1st half 2020” 2021). Recent research conducted by the Identity Theft Resource Center reported a total of 1,862 data breaches in 2021, surpassing both 2020’s total of 1,108 and 23% higher than the previous record of 1,506 set in 2017. (Identity Theft Resource Center “2021 Data Breach Report”, 2022).



Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report found that phishing efforts by hackers to entice users to ‘reveal’ passwords were present in 36% of breaches in 2020, up from 25% in 2019. Ransomware attacks are also on the rise, with almost 85% of ransomware attacks showing evidence of credential theft activity (Coveware “Quarterly Ransomware Report”, 2021)



Digital transformation efforts must address these risks.

The Drive for Zero Trust Security



First coined in 2010, by Forrester analyst John Kindervag, the term ‘Zero Trust’ declares that all network traffic is untrusted and that any request to access any resource must be done securely. (Forrester Research “Build Security Into Your Network’s DNA: The Zero Trust Network Architecture”, 2010). Zero Trust requires that all users, both inside or outside the organization’s network, be authenticated before being allowed to access applications and data.




In 2021, as the rate of cybercrime, digital fraud and ransomware spiraled upward, the Biden Administration issued an executive order (the “Biden Order”) calling on the U.S. government to institute “bold changes and significant investments” in security measures to better insulate federal networks from attack. This was followed by the White House Office of Management and Budget in October 2021 defining a “zero trust” strategy, outlining the security architecture required to overhaul federal cybersecurity practices. In January 2022, the Administration gave federal agencies until the end of the fiscal year 2024 to “achieve specific zero trust security goals.”




The Zero Trust approach will likely further drive nationwide adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA), the requirement of additional verification factors, so users cannot log in with just a username and password. Solutions for achieving zero trust are not likely to include legacy MFA options like vulnerable one-time pin codes or easy-to-discover, knowledge-based questions like “What was the make of your first car?” The Biden Order specifically stated that “agency systems must discontinue support for authentication methods that fail to resist phishing, including protocols that register phone numbers for SMS or voice calls, supply one-time codes, or receive push notifications” Attacks on these legacy methods have proven enterprises will need stronger authentication alternatives to establish trust and defend against highly sophisticated cybercriminal networks.





The Biden Order is expected to drive deployment of upgraded security methods by both the federal government and private sector businesses that contract with the government. We may also expect to see a change from security vendors and enterprise organizations across a range of market segments, as they look to the Biden Order for guidance. In the post-COVID-19 scenario, the global zero trust security market size is projected to grow from USD 19.6 billion in 2020 to USD 51.6 billion by 2026, recording a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% from 2020 to 2026 (MarketsandMarkets, “Zero-Trust Security Market” 2021).




Identity Verification Impact Across Sectors



Financial services, ecommerce and the shared economy, and healthcare are confronted by the challenges of identifying their customers, patients and benefits recipients with ease and certainty in the digital world. Organizations across all sectors need to control access to their data and technology systems by their employees. Governments around the world are imposing new data privacy and authentication regulations, which also impose a “call to action” for many of these businesses and organizations. authID.ai’s approach is to offer our products to enterprises and organizations for their customers in a Customer Identity & Access Management (“CIAM”) model as well as for their employees in a workforce model.
Financial Services & Fintech




Financial services institutions are facing a range of digital transformation challenges and a growth in the embrace of non-traditional fin-tech providers, such as non-bank lending companies, peer-to-peer mobile payment apps and the rapid emergence of cryptocurrencies, NFT’s and other digital assets exchanges. Key to this effort is providing enhanced digital customer experience while balancing the need for high assurance identity authentication to prevent fraud and account take-over throughout the customer journey,

Convenience, however, traditionally opposes stronger identity assurance – the easier it is to open or access an account, the less safeguards there may be to prevent fraud. Javelin Strategy & Research found that in 2020 identity fraud losses in the financial services industry grew to $56 billion. (Javelin Strategy & Research “2020 Identity Fraud Report” 2020). The study reported that identity fraud scams that targeted consumers directly to steal passwords and other personally identifiable information accounted for $43 billion of that cost. LexisNexis found that the cost of fraud for U.S. financial services and lending firms has increased, with every $1 of fraud loss now costing U.S. financial services firms $4, up 25% from 2019. Their study also found that fraudsters followed consumer’s pandemic shift towards mobile transactions, with more than half of surveyed financial services firms reporting a 10% or greater increase in fraud in the mobile channel. (“LexisNexis® True Cost of Fraud™ Study: Financial Services & Lending”, 2021). And with 40% of all fraudulent activity related to account takeover reported to occur within a day after the attack, the need for strong customer authentication is critical.



Experts recommend that efforts to combat this fraud must focus on moving consumers from static passwords to safer authentication methods. According to Gartner, their clients are increasingly seeking “passwordless” authentication methods such as FIDO2 Strong Authentication to improve user experience (UX) and enhance security by eliminating centrally stored passwords—a key target for cyber criminals (Gartner Research Ibid). Goode Intelligence believes that mobile biometrics are key to securely effecting this transformation and forecasts that over $5.8 trillion of mobile biometric payments will be made annually and over three billion biometric payment users by 2026. (Goode Intelligence “Mobile Biometrics for Financial Services; Market and Technology Analysis, Adoption Strategies and Forecasts 2021-2026” 2021).



E-Commerce & Shared Economy



Good consumer experience and personalization is key to driving revenue growth in e-commerce and the shared economy. Biometric identity verification seamlessly integrated into online experiences can reduce friction for first-time buyers who are uninterested in opening accounts before completing their orders or for return customers who expect online purchases to be seamless and secure. A survey of 7,000 North American and European consumers indicated that 92 percent expect digital retail experiences to be fast, frictionless and secure, and 73 percent believe account creation or online transactions should happen instantly. Allowing users to identify themselves with their trusted biometrics not only foils the scammers, but it is also a more effortless and elegant user interface.



In the last year, both traditional and online retailers were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online fulfilment. According to Digital Commerce360 estimates, consumers spent more than $860 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2020, up 44.0% year over year. That increase is purported to be the highest annual U.S. ecommerce growth in at least two decades, and is nearly triple the 15.1% increase in 2019 over 2018.



The sharing economy is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2025 (Statista, “Value of the sharing economy worldwide in 2014 and 2025” 2020). In the sharing economy where assets owned by members of a network can be temporarily accessed by other members of the network, collaborative trust between buyers and sellers is paramount. Identity verification is critical for security and adherence to regulatory requirements such as validating driving or criminal history, age verification, and credit history. Secure biometric identification ensures that service providers and consumers within the sharing economy are who they say they are, reduces friction and improves user experience in the process.



Healthcare



Since 2020, remote healthcare services have expanded exponentially - virtual urgent-care visits spiked by 683% between March and April 2020, while virtual, nonurgent care visits grew by an unprecedented 4,345%. (Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association “COVID-19 transforms health care through telemedicine: Evidence from the field” 2020). ResearchAndMarkets predicts that the global telemedicine market will increase to a value of $144.2 billion by 2030, from $27.8 billion in 2019. (ResearchAndMarkets “Telemedicine Market Research Report to 2030”. 2020).

Unfortunately, with this shift to remote care, a record of weak authentication practices such as shared passwords, and a trove of rich personal data, the healthcare market is believed to be even more susceptible to identity fraud. Further, IBM reported that data breaches in the healthcare sector had the highest average cost amounting to $7.13 million per breach amid the COVID-19 pandemic (IBM Security “Cost of Data Breach Report 2020” 2020).



Medical identity theft has an annual economic impact of around $41 billion a year and the value of stolen medical information is 10 times the value of stolen credit cards. Identity thieves can use compromised medical records to acquire medical treatment, receive elective surgery, and even fill prescriptions using the victim’s personal details. In one study, 20 percent of victims indicated they got the wrong diagnosis or treatment, or that their care was delayed because there was confusion about what was true in their records due to identity theft. In addition, because there are currently no regulatory consumer protections in place that limit the financial liabilities for medical identity fraud, the average out-of-pocket cost to victims is $13,500 (Medical Identity Fraud Alliance).



The FIDO Alliance – The Mission To Eliminate Passwords



The reliance on passwords has long been acknowledged as highly frustrating for users, costly for organizations to maintain and reset quickly, as well as one of the weakest security practices for user authentication. The reuse of the same passwords by individuals across multiple sites, the massive data breaches targeting user credentials, and widespread phishing efforts by hackers to entice users to ‘reveal’ passwords create security risks for every organization.



The FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance was formed in 2012 to address the security risks to enterprises and the problems individual users face in creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. FIDO compliant solutions eliminate passwords by using the combination of biometric verification and device authentication via cryptographic security, thereby speeding up and securing user login. FIDO Alliance members include global leaders and household names in technology and across enterprise software, payments, banking, telecom, ecommerce, identity, government, and healthcare (https://fidoalliance.org/members/). This cross-industry coalition works jointly to develop interoperable authentication standards that reduce reliance on passwords with authentication that is more secure, private, and easier to use.



 Privacy Regulations (Ethical AI)



All business, governmental and other sectors of society are impacted by the need for organizations to comply with increasing data privacy and authentication regulations. The European Union has led the way with its General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, widely considered the gold standard of data privacy regulation, and other jurisdictions around the world are scrambling to catch up. The United States has been slow and has only limited regulation at the federal level, which applies only to specific industries such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. It is therefore falling to the States and local authorities to adopt data privacy requirements such as the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCP and Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act or BIPA, which are being cloned by other jurisdictions. We believe that this growing trend will impose an urgency on organizations of all descriptions to improve their data security and privacy processes, and we believe that biometric identity verification will be a key part of the solution.



We are dedicated to developing advanced methods of protecting consumer privacy and deploying ethical and socially responsible AI. authID is developing a culture that proactively encourages and rewards our employees for considering the ethical implications of our products. Our products are critical to onboarding consumers globally into the digital economy, while better securing their assets and privacy.



We believe that a proactive commitment to ethical AI presents a strong business opportunity for authID and will enable us to bring more accurate products to market more quickly and with less risk to better serve our global user base. Our methods to achieve ethical AI include engaging the users of our products with informed consent, prioritizing the security of our user’s personal information, considering and avoiding potential bias in our algorithms, and monitoring of algorithm performance in our applications.

Growth Strategy



To achieve our goals of increasing our product penetration in the identity authentication market, the following plans comprise our growth strategy. authID intends to expand our focus on channel partners, by signing payment processors, system integrators and additional software suppliers. We are also working to augment our go-to-market model with a new self-service fulfilment model to enable our customers to directly purchase and integrate our identity software products. The Company also intends to increase its investment in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance our IDaaS platform, which are intended to allow us to achieve our growth goals.
Channel Strategy



We intend to expand upon our channel strategy in order to bring our products to a broad market in an efficient and cost-effective way. We have signed and are pursuing channel partners that play a key role in their respective verticals, including become a member of the Temenos Marketplace, a digital technology provider for banks and the Auth0 Marketplace, a catalog of trusted technology integrations that extend the functionality of Auth0’s identity management platform. Our agreement with CU Next Gen provides integration to technology for credit unions in the United States. We are also pursuing additional strategic partners, including payment processors, system integrators and software suppliers.



These channel partners provide access to their wide-ranging enterprise customer portfolios, including new fintech disruptors, merchant services, ecommerce and sharing economy businesses, all of whom we believe could benefit from the use of our identity verification and authentication software products. By entering into agreements with such channel partners and leveraging their relationships, we believe we can expand our footprint much more rapidly and cost effectively, as compared to pursuing direct sales efforts with each customer. Moving forward, we intend to build a small, high-touch, strategic sales team to identify new use cases and drive expansion and standardization on authID within our partners’ customer portfolios.

Self-Service



We intend to enhance our sales model by enabling self-service options for our identity authentication products to efficiently reach the small and medium sized business segment in the United States as well as technology disruptors who require quick and easy use of our platform for authenticating their users. Our planned self-service offerings are intended to increase software developer and IT operator familiarity with our products and lead to quicker deployment of our products by our customers. Customers can then expand the use-cases of our services either through self-service deployment, or with the assistance of our customer success team. We also intend to expand our digital marketing efforts to drive prospective customers to the self-service portal, and therefore limit the need for extensive outbound sales efforts.



Innovation



As banking, fintech, traditional retailer, online e-tailers, and sharing economy providers continue to drive digital transformation across their channels, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new software products that leverage our platform and core competencies in biometric identity authentication. Our focus on innovation, is intended to add value to and retain our existing customers, as well as attract new customers. authID intends to build on its patent pending solutions by using machine learning to enhance the artificial intelligence capabilities of our IDaaS software and platform. We intend to build a team focused on artificial intelligence, employing leading data scientists and machine learning experts. Their mission will be to make the authID biometric authentication platform the fastest and most accurate in the market, and then to continually improve our platform to maintain our leading position.



Consumer frustration with passwords, along with phishing attacks, social engineering and data breaches have driven the need to eliminate passwords and accelerate adoption of multifactor security across all channels. Today there are more than 5 billion smartphones, laptops and tablets around the world that can be used as secure authentication devices to access online services and authorize transactions. These trends are driving the need for a simple, secure, and fast way to manage device registration and deregistration. By combining our patent pending methods for single message authentication, authorization, and audit, and for device registration through strong identity verification, authID has created an Identity Recovery (IDR) software product that puts device management in the control of the account owner. By eliminating the need for users to contact a support center, this product helps our enterprise customers reduce their systems and personnel costs for supporting users attempting to recover their identity or register a new device for authentication.



We have an agreement with LoginID, under which we have jointly developed a FIDO2 compliant strong authentication solution, which we offer as AuthentifID. The AuthentifID service is intended to address the growing demand across all verticals for eliminating the security risks, operational costs, and consumer dissatisfaction with passwords. We also became a member of the FIDO Alliance, the leading international organization comprising global leaders in technology that help establish best practices for FIDO authentication deployment. FIDO compliant solutions eliminate passwords by using the combination of biometric verification and device authentication via cryptographic security, thereby speeding up and securing user login. By combining our core technologies, we have enhanced our IDaaS platform to offer device-based multi-factor identity software to complement our biometric multi-factor authentication product in order to support secure login as well as a broader set of electronic transactions.



In November 2021, the Company received a US patent for Systems and Methods Using a Primary Account Number to Represent Identity Attributes (the ’777 Patent”). The ’777 Patent is for a method that enables various attributes of the individual, to be securely linked to a Primary Account Number (PAN) to authenticate the user’s identity. The PAN of a user may then be used for identifying a user, without any sensitive data being released, as well as used to provide access, such as accessing a bank account, or other payment method of the user. The PAN has become the most ubiquitous way of processing credit card and other payment transactions, which can be sent over established communications networks between banks and merchants anywhere in the world. Using this invention, identity authentication transactions can be authorized via the individual’s biometrics, such as the user’s unique facial features and routed over the same networks in the same way as payment transactions.



In February 2022, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for its US patent application “A Method and System for Transaction Authorization Based on a Parallel Autonomous Channel Multi-User and Multi-Factor Authentication”. The patent protects a core component of authID’s intellectual property relating to its Verified identity verification platform. The patent comprises a method that enables an account holder to authorize a transaction, and at the same time a third-party identity verifier (such as authID) to validate the identity of the account holder, for example through a personal code or biometrics, and confirm the account holder’s consent for the transaction. By orchestrating authentication transactions, authID.ai’s method combines explicit consent for the transaction with identity verification, and creates a permanent record of both, for all parties, secured with a unique digital signature.

Select Acquisitions



As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Marketing and Sales



The Company will primarily target these market segments: 1) fintech and other disrupters of traditional commerce, 2) businesses requiring zero-trust authentication for their workforce and 3) Fortune 1000 enterprises via channel and OEM partnerships established with some of the largest identity access management providers (IAM), risk engines, payment providers, and adjacent software providers. To serve these segments, we have begun to offer turn-key solutions via authID’s CloudConnect program, supporting industry leading IAM, banking and ecommerce platforms to allow our software to be easily deployed with low-code or even no-code implementations.



Our branding and messaging will focus on the fact that all three segments understand the critical requirement to recognize the customer instantly without friction. The Company’s marketing will emphasize the high return on investment that any businesses selling to consumers can achieve if they replace password models with biometric authentication software. We intend to draw prospects to authID by our ability to empower them to fight synthetic identities, account takeovers, phishing attacks while achieving their digital transformation goals. The contracts we seek will be of a recurring nature where we receive an annual fee for every active user (who logs into an application, changes their account profile, or attempts a high value transaction).



In order to achieve these goals and thereby drive sales and new revenue, the Company intends to build our sales and marketing team, expand our sales and marketing activities, as well as invest in innovative technologies.



Revenue Model



Identity Management Solutions and Products



The biometric software products are priced based on a multi-year licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system and the volume of authentications required (for example the number of times a consumer is required to present proof of identity). The Company provides its new IDaaS platform services based on a subscription model, with tiered fees per enrolled user Verified Workforce) or active user (Verified Consumer), comprising a periodic subscription and where applicable a per transaction fee. The Company’s CardsPlus plastic and credentials card products are sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product, as well as the services provided. Additionally, the Company receives an annual maintenance fee for support for an identity product previously sold to one of its customers.
Payment Processing Solutions and Products



The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction or monthly minimum basis The pricing for the Company’s closed loop financial payment platform is based on a combination of transaction fee and a subscription model based on numbers of cardholders and merchants enrolled. The Company also earned leasing income from the rental of unattended kiosks but does not expect this revenue stream to continue in the future.

Competition



authID offers its Verified™ IDaaS platform allowing the Company to on-board customers who wish to deploy our services and solutions in order to know with biometric certainty who is engaging with them. authID’s solutions include the ability to verify the identity of a user, via remote identity proofing, then enable digital access, as well as transaction and device authentication, all digitally signed by the user’s identity. The Company’s platform utilizes commodity, consumer grade mobile devices for customer deployment with users engaging with the platform via a web-browser or corresponding Android or iOS smartphone app.



We also offer certain payment processing solutions and smart card products manufacturing and printing. The industry sectors in which these products compete are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. We will need to consistently develop and improve our products in order to remain competitive.



The Company’s proprietary, patent pending Verified IDaaS platform allows our customers to establish trust in identity, authenticate and verify an identity without a password but with both device and biometric  certainty, and not with just a password or one-time pin code. authID.ai’s IDaaS platform has several identity verification and authentication products each facing different competitors and incumbent technologies we can replace.



For onboarding users, employees or customers remotely, Verified delivers seamless identity verification with quick, mobile identity document verification and facial biometric matching of a selfie to the identity credential photo with liveness confirmation. Our FIDO2 strong customer authentication and passwordless login product, leverages strong identity verification during device authenticator registration to create a digital chain of trust between biometrically verified individuals, their accounts, and their devices. Rooted to a trusted identity obtained during the identity verification and onboarding process, Verified’s biometric multi-factor authentication offers high-assurance, biometric, cloud-based, multi-factor authentication to secure high-risk transactions.



In reviewing the competitors that exist for the Company’s current and planned platform products relating to the three main elements of identity management: the establishing of identity, use of identity through device-based authentication, and use of identity through cloud-based biometric verification, the Company considers a number of factors. authID’s platform utilizes an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) approach which combines the three elements into a single fast, secure, and fully automated, platform. authID believes that this full stack platform approach is exceptional in that it offers documentary identity verification, FIDO device authentication, and cloud based, biometric, multi-factor verification covering digital account access and transaction confirmation use cases. The competitive landscape includes several companies that mainly address only one element, with some addressing multiple elements independently without a seamless integration between them.



In looking further at our competition, the Company does not consider providers which are major conglomerates with vertically integrated cybersecurity companies, due to the vast array of services which they offer. Furthermore, some of the competitors which do offer solutions for digital use cases, are major legacy providers offering hardware heavy solutions principally for governmental users. These include Idemia, Thales, and Supercom. This is in contrast to authID’s IDaaS approach which is based on offering app and browser-based software products which are usable on mobile and desktop computing devices without additional hardware requirements.



To further breakdown the competitive landscape into companies that provide identity proofing we consider the following competitors: Jumio, Au10Tix, OnFido, Mitek, Trulioo, ID.me, Veriff, and Acuant. Companies that provide only a single solution may be seeking to combine with authentication and biometric verification technology providers to expand their ID proofing solutions’ capabilities. While authID will continue to offer Proofing (especially for SMBs that need a complete IDaaS solution) Proof is used once at enrollment, whereas our authentication service is used over and over in a recurring revenue model. In appropriate cases we may decide to cooperate with these entities and yield the one-time revenue to gain the recurring authentication revenue.



Another aspect of the competitive landscape is device-based authentication products using the FIDO standard. Companies that are believed to be competing with authID in this area are: HYPR, Strongkey, Daon, Trusona, Callsign, Duo and Transmit Security.

authID believes that the simplicity and elegance of simply looking at your phone to “trust your selfie” should compete well against these incumbents, and offer a more ubiquitous, cost-effective solution without dedicated hardware. 



Finally, looking at the competitive landscape for cloud-based biometric identity verification applications the companies that are believed to be competing with authID in this area are Jumio, Aware, Acuant, Au10Tix, NEC, and Idemia.



There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems. For example, Stripe announced in June 2021 that they are entering the proofing market, but it is not possible to say what impact that may have on competition.



The Cards Plus business faces competition both locally in South Africa and internationally. China has become a source of imports of card products at highly competitive pricing and some local suppliers are reliant on Chinese card manufacturers. Local competitors include Card Technology Services, Easy Card and Open Gate, Cardz Group and XH Smart Technology (Africa). That said, we believe that we are the only significant manufacturer in South Africa using digital print technology.



The payment processing industry has many competitors who provide gateway services, closed loop end-to-end solutions, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. As these types of services are usually supplied by regional or country specific companies, the following summary of this competitive landscape, is focused on those countries or regions the Company is actively pursuing business in today. In Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America where the Company is focused, major competitors include PayU, Credibanco, Redeban, Mercado Pago, Nequi, and QPagos. Some of these companies may on the other hand be potential customers for our identify transaction platform and biometric authentication services. Companies in this region that also compete in those sectors include Veritran, Certicamaras, Olimpia IT, Evertec-Processa and Indra.



Governmental Regulations



The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company’s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.



Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company’s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company are subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company’s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.



Data protection legislation in various countries in which the Company does business (including Colombia and the United Kingdom) may require it to register its databases with governmental authorities in those countries and to comply with additional disclosure and consent requirements with regard to the collection, storage and use of personal information of individuals resident in those countries. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the beginning of 2020, and in Maine in July 2020, and other states, such as New York are considering additional regulations. Specifically, several states are considering adopting a Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA modelled on the Illinois statute, which governs the collection, processing, storage and distribution of biometric information such as facial biometric templates and fingerprints. Several of these new statutes give individuals rights of action to sue violators, which have resulted in a number of class action law suits. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.
