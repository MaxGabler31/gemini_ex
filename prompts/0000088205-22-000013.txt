We disclaim any responsibility, except to the extent we are legally required, to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
Business
SPX Corporation (“SPX”, “our” or “we”) was founded in Muskegon, Michigan in 1912 as the Piston Ring Company and adopted our current name in 1988. Since 1968, we have been incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and we have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1972.
On September 26, 2015, we completed the spin-off to our stockholders (the “Spin-Off”) of all the outstanding shares of SPX FLOW, Inc. (“SPX FLOW”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPX prior to the Spin-Off, which at the time of the Spin-Off held the businesses comprising our Flow Technology reportable segment, our Hydraulic Technologies business, and certain of our corporate subsidiaries. 
Prior to the Spin-Off, our businesses serving the power generation markets had a major impact on the consolidated financial results of SPX. In the years leading up to the Spin-Off, these businesses experienced significant declines in revenues and profitability associated with weak demand and increased competition within the global power generation markets. Based on a review of our post-spin portfolio and the belief that a recovery within the power generation markets was unlikely in the foreseeable future, we decided coming out of the Spin-Off that our strategic focus would be on our (i) scalable growth businesses that serve the heating, ventilation and cooling (“HVAC”) and detection and measurement markets and (ii) power transformer and process cooling systems businesses. As a result, we have significantly reduced our exposure to the power generation markets as indicated by the dispositions of our dry cooling and Balcke Dürr businesses during 2016. Additionally, during 2018, we initiated a plan to wind-down the SPX Heat Transfer (“Heat Transfer”) business, with the wind-down completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of completing such wind-down activities, we are reporting the Heat Transfer business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Lastly, with its substantial completion of the remaining

scope on the large power projects in South Africa, our South African subsidiary, DBT Technologies (PTY) LTD’s (“DBT”), completed wind-down activities during the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of completing wind-down activities, we are now reporting the DBT business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See MD&A and Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these actions.
On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik Marine (“Sabik”), primarily a manufacturer of obstruction lighting products. The post-acquisition operating results of Sabik Marine are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment. 
On July 3, 2019 and November 12, 2019, we completed the acquisitions of SGS Refrigeration Inc. (“SGS”) and Patterson-Kelley, LLC (“Patterson-Kelley”), respectively. SGS is a manufacturer of industrial refrigeration products, while Patterson-Kelley is a manufacturer and distributor of commercial boilers and water heaters. The post-acquisition operating results of SGS and Patterson-Kelley are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.
On September 2, 2020 and November 11, 2020, we completed the acquisitions of ULC Robotics (“ULC”) and Sensors & Software, Inc. (“Sensors & Software”), respectively. ULC is leading developer of robotic systems, mechanical learning applications, and inspection technology for the energy, utility, and industrial markets, while Sensors & Software is a manufacturer and distributor of ground penetrating radar products used for locating underground utilities, detecting unexploded ordinances, and geotechnical and geological investigations. The post-acquisition operating results of ULC and Sensors & Software are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.
On April 19, 2021 and August 2, 2021, we completed the acquisitions of Sealite Pty Ltd and affiliated entities, including Sealite USA, LLC (doing business as Avlite Systems) and Star2M Pty Ltd (collectively, "Sealite"), and Enterprise Control Systems Ltd ("ECS"), respectively. Sealite is a leader in the design and manufacture of marine and aviation Aids to Navigation products, while ECS is a manufacturer and designer of highly-engineered tactical datalinks and radio frequency (“RF”) countermeasures, including counter-drone and counter-IED RF jammers. The post-acquisition operating results of Sealite and ECS are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.
On October 1, 2021 we completed the sale of SPX Transformer Solutions, Inc. (“Transformer Solutions”) pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated June 8, 2021 with GE-Prolec Transformers, Inc. (the “Purchaser”) and Prolec GE Internacional, S. de R.L. de C.V. We are reporting Transformer Solutions as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. In connection with the disposition of Transformer Solutions and its classification as a discontinued operation, we have eliminated the Engineered Solutions reportable segment and have reflected the remaining operations of the former Engineered Solutions reportable segment within the HVAC reportable segment for all periods presented.
On December 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cincinnati Fan & Ventilator Co., Inc. (“Cincinnati Fan”), a leader in engineered air movement solutions, including blowers and critical exhaust systems. The post-acquisition operating results of Cincinnati Fan are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Part I pertain to continuing operations only (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations).
We are a diversified, global supplier of infrastructure equipment serving the HVAC and detection and measurement markets. With operations in 15 countries and approximately 3,100 employees, we offer a wide array of highly engineered infrastructure products with strong brands.
HVAC solutions offered by our businesses include package and process cooling equipment, engineered air quality solutions, residential and commercial boilers, comfort heating, and ventilation products. Our market leading brands, coupled with our commitment to continuous innovation and focus on our customers’ needs, enables our HVAC cooling and heating businesses to serve an expanding number of industrial, commercial and residential customers. Growth for our HVAC businesses will be driven by innovation, increased scalability, and our ability to meet the needs of broader markets.
Our detection and measurement product lines encompass underground pipe and cable locators, inspection and rehabilitation equipment, robotic systems, bus fare collection systems, communication technologies, and obstruction lighting. Our detection and measurement solutions enable utilities, telecommunication providers and regulators, and municipalities and transit authorities to build, monitor and maintain vital infrastructure. Our technology and decades of experience have afforded us a strong position in specific detection and measurement markets. We intend to expand our portfolio of specialized products through new, innovative hardware and software solutions in an attempt to (i) further capitalize on the detection and measurement markets we currently serve and (ii) expand the number of markets that we serve.
Reportable Segments 
Our operating segments are aggregated into the following two reportable segments: HVAC and Detection and Measurement. The factors considered in determining our aggregated segments are the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of products sold or services provided, production processes, types of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. In determining our reportable segments, we apply the threshold criteria of the Segment Reporting Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“Codification”). Operating income for our reportable segments is determined before considering impairment and special charges, long-term incentive compensation, certain other operating income/expense and other indirect corporate expenses. This is consistent with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates the results of each segment. 
HVAC Reportable Segment
Our HVAC reportable segment had revenues of $752.1, $740.8 and $738.7 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and backlog of $226.9 and $150.1 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 97% of the segment’s backlog as of December 31, 2021 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2022. The segment engineers, designs, manufactures, installs and services cooling products and engineered air quality solutions for the HVAC and industrial markets, as well as heating and ventilation products for the residential and commercial markets. The primary distribution channels for the segment’s products are direct to customers, independent manufacturing representatives, third-party distributors, and retailers. The segment serves a customer base in North America, Europe, and Asia. Core brands for our cooling products include Marley, Recold, SGS and Cincinnati Fan, while our heating and ventilation products are sold under the Berko, Qmark, Fahrenheat, Leading Edge, and Patterson-Kelley brands, and our WM Technologies subsidiary sells its products under the Weil-McLain and Williamson-Thermoflo brands.
Detection and Measurement Reportable Segment
Our Detection and Measurement reportable segment had revenues of $467.4, $387.3 and $384.9 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and backlog of $153.6 and $89.3 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 71% of the segment’s backlog as of December 31, 2021 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2022. The segment engineers, designs, manufactures, services, and installs underground pipe and cable locators, inspection and rehabilitation equipment, robotic systems, bus fare collection systems, communication technologies, and obstruction lighting. The primary distribution channels for the segment’s products are direct to customers and third-party distributors. The segment serves a global customer base, with a strong presence in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Core brands for our underground pipe and cable locators and inspection and rehabilitation equipment are Radiodetection, Pearpoint, Schonstedt, Dielectric, Riser Bond, Warren G-V, Cues, ULC Robotics, and Sensors & Software. Our bus fare collection systems, communication technologies, and obstruction lighting are sold under the Genfare, TCI, Flash Technology, Sabik Marine, Sealite, Avlite and ECS brand names, respectively.
Acquisitions
We regularly review and negotiate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. 
As previously indicated, we acquired Sealite, ECS, and Cincinnati Fan in 2021, ULC and Sensors & Software in 2020, and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019.
Divestitures
We regularly review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As previously indicated, the divestiture of Transformer Solutions was completed in 2021. There were no divestitures of businesses in 2020 or 2019. As previously indicated, we completed the wind-down of our DBT and Heat Transfer businesses in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
International Operations
We are a multinational corporation with operations in over 15 countries. Sales outside the United States were $228.0, $192.4 and $150.9 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our international operations.
Research and Development
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. These efforts encompass certain of our products with divisional engineering teams coordinating their resources. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Patents/Trademarks
We own 163 domestic and 265 foreign patents (comprising 154 patent “families”), including 34 patents that were issued in 2021, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors.”
Outsourcing and Raw Materials
We manufacture many of the components used in our products; however, our strategy includes outsourcing certain components and sub-assemblies to other companies where strategically and economically beneficial. In instances where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product or component and ultimately to our inability to supply products to our customers. We believe that we generally will be able to continue to obtain adequate supplies of key products, components or appropriate substitutes at reasonable costs. For information regarding COVID-19 impacts, please refer to "MD&A - COVID-19 Pandemic, Supply Chain Disruptions, and Other Economic Factors."
We are subject to increases in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products and steel. In recent years, we have generally been able to offset increases in raw material costs. Occasionally, we are subject to long-term supplier contracts, which may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.
Due to our diverse products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. We are not significantly dependent on any one or a limited number of suppliers, and we have been able to obtain suitable quantities of raw materials at competitive prices. For information regarding COVID-19 impacts, please refer to "MD&A - COVID-19 Pandemic, Supply Chain Disruptions, and Other Economic Factors."
Competition
Our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by reportable or operating segment since we and our competitors do not offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products and services offered. See “Reportable Segments” above for a discussion of our competitors.
Environmental Matters
See “MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates — Contingent Liabilities,” “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,100 employees, with approximately 2,400 employed in the United States. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs. Six domestic collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 300 of our employees. In addition, we have various collective labor arrangements covering certain of our non-U.S. employee groups. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. As such, we strive to provide an environment where employees are developed and provided challenging career growth opportunities, and know their inputs and contributions are appreciated. We offer a “Total Rewards” program that 
provides comprehensive compensation and benefits packages that are competitive with the market and choices designed to reward employees and assist them in managing their well-being. In 2021, we also focused significant time on re-working many of our policies and programs to provide increased flexibility and work-life balance to our team members. Together, these opportunities present significant growth potential for our employees from a financial, professional, and personal standpoint. 
As part of our focus on building and sustaining a highly capable, engaged and motivated workforce that has the ability to deliver on the current and future requirements of the company, we continue to advance our talent management framework, known as RiSE, which helps us Reach, Identify, Strengthen, and Engage our workforce. Recent areas of focus include: the enhancement of our Front-line Leadership Program, introduction of a new on-demand learning platform and the on-going expansion of our talent review and succession planning programs. We also were able to successfully move even more of our education and training programs to an online format to allow for expanded participation and broader, time-flexible development. 
During 2021, we continued our focus on enhancing our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion programs, aimed at ensuring we provide an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. We launched our formal Diversity & Inclusion Statement and published an enterprise charter to align the organization on our commitments. Our Executive Leadership Team and Diversity & Inclusion Council, both comprised of senior leaders from across the enterprise and led by our CEO, facilitated listening sessions with employees from across the globe to learn what was important to them and how we could create an even better work environment. In response to the feedback received, multiple initiatives were undertaken to increase communications, build the capabilities of our leaders (we trained over 500 employees on how to Create an Inclusive Environment) and on furthering the dialogue across the enterprise. A Day of Understanding was held in each business to communicate, engage and educate our global teams. Our networking and action groups, comprised of dozens of “Ambassadors” from across the company, were active participants in the development and implementation of our strategies and programming to ensure that the actions we take drive meaningful and impactful results for our employees. We believe that through these efforts we can unlock greater potential, provide new opportunities for our employees, and benefit from diverse backgrounds and points of view. Valuing diversity and inclusion is, and will be, an on-going part of the culture we are continuously working to strengthen.
Other Matters
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any period presented.
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses’ sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.
Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.
