Item 1. BUSINESS.
 
Our Business. Our business, conducted through our subsidiary Florida Rock & Tank Lines, Inc., consists of hauling petroleum related products and dry bulk commodities and liquid chemicals. We are one of the largest regional tank truck carriers in North America. Based on the Tank Truck Carrier 2018 Gross Revenue Report issued by Bulk Transporter, we are the 10th largest bulk tank carrier in North America by revenue.  We operate terminals in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Tennessee. We do not own any of the products we haul; rather, we act as a third party carrier to deliver our customers’ products from point A to point B, using predominately Company employees and Company-owned tractors and tank trailers. Approximately 86% of our business consists of hauling liquid petroleum products (mostly gas and diesel fuel) from large scale fuel storage facilities to our customers’ retail outlets (e.g. convenience stores, truck stops and fuel depots) where we off-load the product into our customers’ fuel storage tanks for ultimate sale to the retail consumer. The remaining 14% of our business consists of hauling dry bulk commodities such as cement, lime and various industrial powder products and liquid chemicals. As of September 30, 2019, we employed 530 revenue-producing drivers who operated our fleet of 376 Company tractors (excluding 9 being placed in service and 3 being prepared for sale), 24 owner operators and 491 trailers from our 19 terminals and 6 satellite locations.
 
Tractors and Trailers. During fiscal 2019, the Company purchased 60 new tractors. Our fiscal 2020 capital budget includes 60 new tractors. We believe maintaining a modern fleet will result in reduced maintenance expenses, improved operating efficiencies and enhanced driver recruitment and retention. At September 30, 2019 the Company operated a fleet of 376 tractors (excluding 9 being placed in service and 3 being prepared for sale), and 491 tank trailers. The Company owns all of the tank trailers and tractors used to conduct our business, except for 24 tractors owned by owner-operators and 30 full-service leased 2019 model year tractors located in key areas without Company maintenance shops.
Competitors. The tank lines transportation business is extremely competitive and fragmented. We have between multiple competitors in each of our markets, consisting of other carriers of varying sizes as well as our customers’ private fleets. Price, service and location are the major competitive factors in each local market. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and a more expansive geographic footprint than our company. Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices, implement new pricing strategies or maintain significant growth in our business.
 
Our largest competitors include Kenan Advantage Group, Eagle Transport, Penn Tank Lines, CTL, and Commercial Carriers.  We also compete with smaller carriers in most of our markets. 
 
Our strategy is to build long-term partnerships with our customers based on the highest level of customer service and reliability. The current trend is that hypermarkets and super regional and national chains have emerged to replace many of the independent convenience stores and service stations historically served by many of our competitors. As this continues, we believe that our size, capabilities, scope of services and geographic reach will provide us a competitive advantage over smaller carriers with fewer resources.

Customers. Approximately 86% of our business consists of hauling petroleum related products. Our petroleum clients include major convenience store and hypermarket accounts, fuel wholesalers and major oil companies.  We strive to build long-term relationships with major customers by providing outstanding customer service. During fiscal 2019, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 63.1% of revenue. One of these customers, Murphy USA, accounted for 19.2% of revenue. The loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and income. Our transportation services agreements with our customers generally are terminable upon 90-120 days’ notice, but nine of our top 10 accounts have been customers for at least 5 years.
 
Our dry bulk and chemical customers include large industrial companies including cement and concrete accounts and product distribution companies.  Our customer relationships are long-standing and have grown over time as a result of consistently high safety and service levels.
 
Sales and Marketing. Our marketing activities are focused on building our relationships with existing customers as well as developing new business opportunities. Our senior management team has extensive experience in marketing specialized fuels delivery services. In addition, significant portions of our marketing activities are conducted locally by our regional managers, terminal managers and dispatchers who act as local customer service representatives. These managers and dispatchers maintain regular contact with customers and are well-positioned to identify the changing transportation needs of customers in their respective geographic areas. We also actively participate in various trade associations, including the National Tank Truck Carriers Association, various state trucking and petroleum marketing associations and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers Association.
Environmental Matters. Our activities, which involve the transportation, storage and disposal of fuels and other hazardous substances and wastes, are subject to various federal, state and local health and safety laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including, among others, those governing the transportation, management and disposal of hazardous materials, vehicle emissions, underground and above ground storage tanks and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations involve risks of fuel spillage or seepage, hazardous waste disposal and other activities that are potentially damaging to the environment. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of or liable under applicable laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business.
 
Most of our truck terminals are located in industrial areas, where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Under environmental laws, we could be held responsible for the costs relating to any contamination at those or other of our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, including cleanup costs, fines and penalties and personal injury and property damages. Under some of these laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state statutes, liability for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed upon any current or former owner or operator, or upon any party who sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness of any disposal activities or whether a party owned or operated a contaminated property at the time of the release of hazardous substances. From time to time, we have incurred remedial costs and/or regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases relating to our facilities or operations, and, notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program, we may incur such obligations in the future. The discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations or liabilities in the future could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of

operations or our business reputation.
 
Our operations involve hazardous materials and could result in significant environmental liabilities and costs. For a discussion of certain risks of our being associated with transporting hazardous substances see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business”
 
Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal trends common in the refined petroleum products delivery industry. We typically face reduced demand for refined petroleum products delivery services during the winter months and increased demand during the spring and summer months. Further, operating costs and earnings are generally adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. These factors generally result in lower operating results during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year and cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our operating expenses also have been somewhat higher in the winter months, due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for tractors and trailers in colder months.
Employees. As of September 30, 2019, the Company employed 761 people.
