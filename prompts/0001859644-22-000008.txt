Item 1.    Business. 
Arrow Electronics, Inc. (the “company” or “Arrow”) is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company has one of the world's broadest portfolios of product offerings available from leading electronic components and enterprise computing solutions suppliers, coupled with a range of services, solutions, and software that help industrial and commercial customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. Arrow was incorporated in New York in 1946 and serves over 220,000 customers worldwide.
Arrow's diverse worldwide customer base consists of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), value-added resellers (“VARs”), managed service providers (“MSPs”), contract manufacturers (“CMs”), and other commercial customers. These customers include manufacturers of industrial equipment (such as machine tools, factory automation, and robotic equipment) and consumer products serving industries ranging from aerospace and defense, alternative energy, automotive and transportation, medical, professional services, and telecommunications, among others.
The company has two business segments, the global components business and the global enterprise computing solutions (“ECS”) business. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs and MSPs through its global ECS business segment. For 2021, approximately 76% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment, and approximately 24% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment. The financial information about the company's business segments and geographic operations is found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The company maintains over 245 sales facilities and 43 distribution and value-added centers, serving over 90 countries. Both business segments have operations in each of the three largest electronics markets; the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific regions. Arrow's business strategy is to be the world's foremost technology solutions provider. The company guides innovation forward by helping its customers in the areas of industrial automation, edge computing, cloud computing, smart and connected devices, homes, cities, and transportation to deliver new technologies, new materials, new ideas, and new electronics that improve businesses' performance and consumers' lives. Arrow aggregates disparate sources of electronics components, infrastructure software, and IT hardware to increasingly provide complete solutions for customers on behalf of its suppliers. Arrow’s goal is to leave no segment of the market underserved in terms of the products offered and services provided. The company aims to accelerate its customers’ time to market, enable secure and consistent supply chains, and drive growth on behalf of its suppliers.
The company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, generate earnings per share growth in excess of competitors’ earnings per share growth and market expectations, grow earnings per share at a rate that provides the capital necessary to support the company’s business strategy, allocate and deploy capital effectively so that return on invested capital exceeds the company’s cost of capital, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and expand its geographic reach.
Global Components
Global components markets and distributes electronic components enabled by a comprehensive range of value-added capabilities and services. The company provides customers with the ability to deliver the latest technologies to the market through design engineering, global marketing and integration, global logistics, and supply chain management. The company offers the convenience of accessing, from a single source, multiple technologies and products from its suppliers with rapid or scheduled deliveries. Most of the company's customers require delivery of their orders on schedules or volumes that are generally not available on direct purchases from manufacturers. 
The global components business design, engineering, global marketing and integration services provide a variety of mechanisms, commonly known as ‘demand creation,’ to promote the future sale of suppliers’ products. Most notably, the company will register engineered designs and schematics showing the use of suppliers’ components in the company’s customers’ future products. Providing these services generally lead to longer and more profitable relationships that benefit the company as well as our suppliers and customers. 
Beyond the traditional source of sales and profits tied to the buying and selling of electronic components, the company has a global supply chain services business that has grown organically within the global components business. It derives services revenue from providing supply chain services such as procurement, logistics, warehousing, and insights from data analytics. 
Within the global components business segment for 2021, net sales of approximately 78% consist of semiconductor products and related services; approximately 13% consist of passive, electro-mechanical, and interconnect products, such as capacitors, resistors, potentiometers, power supplies, relays, switches, and connectors; approximately 7% consist of computing and memory; and approximately 2% consist of other products and services. 
Global ECS
The company's global ECS business segment is a leading value-added provider of comprehensive computing solutions and services. Global ECS' portfolio of computing solutions includes datacenter, cloud, security, and analytics solutions. Global ECS brings broad market access, extensive supplier relationships, scale, and resources to help its VARs and MSPs meet the needs of their end-users. Global ECS works with VARs and MSPs to tailor complex IT solutions for their end-users. Customers have access to various services including engineering and integration support, warehousing and logistics, marketing resources, and authorized hardware and software training. Global ECS' suppliers benefit from demand creation, speed to market, and efficient supply chain management. 
Global ECS further supports customers by enabling their cloud solutions businesses through ArrowSphere, a cloud marketplace and management platform. ArrowSphere helps VARs and MSPs to manage, differentiate and scale their cloud businesses. It simplifies the operational complexity of delivering hybrid multi-cloud solutions while providing the business intelligence that IT solution providers need to drive growth. By making cloud-based solutions available through ArrowSphere, suppliers benefit from greater subscription adoption, consumption, and utilization.
Within the global ECS business segment for 2021, net sales of approximately 42% consist of software, 35% consist of storage, 11% consist of industry standard servers, 5% consist of proprietary servers, and 7% consist of other products and services. 
Customers and Suppliers
The company and its affiliates serve over 220,000 industrial and commercial customers. Industrial customers range from major OEMs and CMs to small engineering firms, while commercial customers primarily include VARs, MSPs, and OEMs. No single customer accounted for more than 2% of the company's 2021 consolidated sales. The company's sales teams focus on an extensive portfolio of products and services to support customers' material management and production needs, including connecting customers to the company's field application engineers that provide technical support and serve as a gateway to the company's supplier partners. The company's sales representatives generally focus on a specific customer segment, particular product lines or a specific geography, and provide end-to-end product offerings and solutions with an emphasis on helping customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. Substantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.
One supplier accounted for approximately 17% of the company's consolidated sales in 2021. No other single supplier accounted for more than 7% of the company's consolidated sales in 2021. The company believes that many of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. However, certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business segment, rely on a limited number of suppliers with the strategy of providing focused support, extensive product knowledge, and customized service to suppliers, MSPs, and VARs. Most of the company's purchases are pursuant to distributor agreements, which are typically non-exclusive and cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice.
Distribution Agreements
Certain agreements with suppliers protect the company against the potential write-down of inventories due to technological change or suppliers' price reductions. These contractual provisions typically provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of return privileges, scrap allowances, and price protection. Under the terms of the related distributor agreements and assuming the company complies with certain conditions, such suppliers are required to credit the company for reductions in suppliers' list prices. As of December 31, 2021, this type of arrangement covered approximately 50% of the company's consolidated inventories. In addition, under the terms of many such agreements, the company has the right to return to the supplier, for credit, a defined portion of those inventory items purchased within a designated period of time. 
A supplier, which elects to terminate a distribution agreement, may be required to purchase from the company the total amount of its products carried in inventory. As of December 31, 2021, this type of repurchase arrangement covered approximately 45% of the company's consolidated inventories. 
While these inventory practices do not wholly protect the company from inventory losses, the company believes that they currently provide substantial protection from such losses.
Competition
The company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need to continually improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.
The company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment, electronic catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company seeks to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors.
The company believes that it is well equipped to compete effectively with its competitors in all of these areas due to its comprehensive product and service offerings, highly-skilled work force, and global distribution network.
Government Regulation
The company is subject to and endeavors to comply with various government regulations in the United States as well as various jurisdictions where it operates. These regulations cover several diverse areas including trade compliance, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, money laundering, securities, environmental, and data and privacy protection. Regulatory or government authorities where the company operates may have enforcement powers that can subject the company to legal penalties or other measures and can impose changes or conditions in the way it conducts business. For example, local authorities may disagree with how the company classifies its products for trade and taxation purposes, and the company may be required to change its classifications, which could increase the company’s operating costs or subject it to increased taxes or fines and penalties. Increased government scrutiny of the company's actions or enforcement could materially and adversely affect its business or damage its reputation. In addition, the company may conduct, or it may be required to conduct, internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government or regulatory agencies, which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert management and key personnel from the company’s business operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. 
Human Capital
The company’s business strategy is to be the world’s foremost technology solutions provider, and the company’s talent strategy powers that business strategy through its people. The company’s talent ecosystem, with all of its multi-cultural diversity, spans 53 countries. The company and its employees around the world rally behind a common greater good: to make the benefits of technology accessible to all. 
The company believes its deep capabilities and broad services are made possible by a broad group of professionals who understand their problems from numerous perspectives and curate forward-looking, comprehensive solutions. The company's employees’ diverse backgrounds have melded into rich perspectives that sharpen the company, frame how its global network of engineers, suppliers, and manufacturers work together, and enhance value for customers.
Our business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals.
The company and its affiliates employed approximately 20,700 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2021. The following table shows the company's approximate headcount by region:

 | Americas | EMEA | Asia-Pacific
Headcount | 6,100 | 6,800 | 7,800 

Gender and Racial/Ethnic Diversity
The company has a long-standing goal for gender representation share growth at all levels of the organization globally, and for race/ethnicity representation share growth at all levels of the organization in the United States. Efforts towards employee diversity share growth are reflected in the company’s talent strategy through (a) internal talent development programs that advance career opportunity for women and underrepresented employees, (b) hiring, (c) retention, and (d) training programs designed to emphasize and expand diversity and inclusion priorities that align to our business strategy.

Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention
The company believes in work that elevates career opportunity for all and views its employees as career investors. Employees invest in Arrow by bringing their unique talents, experiences, and perspectives to the organization through their daily work. The company is committed to helping employees receive a return on their investment, in the form of compounding knowledge, skills, abilities, and earnings opportunity as their careers grow within the company. The company supports employees through targeted curriculum and tools focused on building skills and capabilities within each workforce segment. Arrow also offers a suite of enterprise leadership training and development programs. These programs create value by growing employee capability, which in turn facilitates business growth. For example, nearly three quarters of manager-level and above positions were filled internally during 2021 and 2020. 
Attracting and retaining early career talent enables Arrow to grow employee capability from the ground up. Through the company’s university intern and graduate programs, apprenticeship programs, and management trainee programs, Arrow builds a diverse talent pipeline.
The company believes in rewards that improve performance outcomes for all and endorses a pay-for-performance philosophy via performance differentiation and rewarding employees through compensation and benefits. Arrow's compensation and benefits programs are aligned with the local external market to attract, grow, and retain talent. Arrow’s commitment to rewarding employees fairly based on skills, experience, contribution/performance, internal equity, and the external market enables us to maximize employees’ return on their career investment. The company reviews our compensation and benefits programs and practices regularly to ensure they remain competitive and equitable.
Arrow’s Response to COVID
Arrow has worked to protect its global workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic by aligning to guidance of the world's leading health authorities and state and national governments, as well as local government directives, at all locations around the globe to safely continue working in person as prudent, while also providing exemptions and tools for extended remote work, and enhanced benefits as appropriate. To protect the safety of our employees, customers, and suppliers, the company 
implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for our U.S. employees, with the exception of our light industrial population in our distribution facilities and employees with approved accommodations. All employees in the distribution facilities and those with approved accommodations are required to wear masks when on site at Arrow facilities. All U.S. new hires, including light industrial, are required to be fully vaccinated.
