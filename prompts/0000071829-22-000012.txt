ITEM 1. Business
General
Newpark Resources, Inc. is a geographically diversified supplier providing environmentally-sensitive products, as well as rentals and services to customers across multiple industries. We operate our business through two reportable segments: Industrial Solutions and Fluids Systems. Our Industrial Solutions segment includes our Site and Access Solutions business, along with our Industrial Blending operations. Site and Access Solutions provides temporary worksite access solutions, including the rental of our manufactured recyclable composite matting systems, along with related site construction and services to customers in various markets including power transmission, oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”), pipeline, renewable energy, petrochemical, construction and other industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. We also sell our manufactured recyclable composite mats to customers around the world, with power transmission being the primary end-market. Our Fluids Systems segment provides customized drilling, completion, and stimulation fluids products and related technical services to E&P customers primarily in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), as well as certain countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America. We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids systems, which serve to support our activities in certain regions within the U.S. drilling fluids market and also sell the products to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. In addition, we sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third-party industrial (non-oil and natural gas) markets.

Industry Fundamentals
Our Industrial Solutions segment serves a variety of industries, providing temporary worksite access products and services to the power transmission, E&P, pipeline, renewable energy, petrochemical, construction and other industries. The demand for our products and services from customers in these industries is driven, in part, by infrastructure construction and maintenance activity levels in these industries within the United States and the United Kingdom, including required infrastructure investments to support energy transition efforts. During 2020, our business was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers delayed purchases and planned projects citing COVID-related market uncertainty, permitting delays, and logistical restrictions. Product sales revenues largely reflect sales to power transmission customers and other industrial markets, and typically fluctuate based on the timing of customer orders. We expect customer activity, particularly in the power transmission sector, will remain robust in the coming years, driven in part by the impacts of the energy transition and the increasing investment in grid reliance initiatives.
Our Fluids Systems operating results remain dependent on oil and natural gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve and the nature of the drilling operations (including the depth and whether the wells are drilled vertically or horizontally), which governs the revenue potential of each well. Drilling activity levels, in turn, depend on a variety of factors, including oil and natural gas commodity pricing, inventory levels, product demand, and regulatory restrictions. Oil and natural gas prices and activity are cyclical and volatile, and this market volatility has a significant impact on our operating results. In the transition to clean-renewable energy sources, we see an expanding role for geothermal in the coming years, although this application remains a small portion of the global energy market today.
While our Fluids Systems revenue potential is driven by a number of factors including those described above, rig count data remains the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity. The average Baker Hughes Company North 
American Rig Count was 1,077 in 2019, declining to 522 in 2020, then increasing to 606 in 2021. During 2019, U.S. rig count steadily declined, exiting the year at 805 active rigs, a 26% decline from the end of 2018. During March 2020, oil prices collapsed due to geopolitical events along with the worldwide effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, U.S. rig count declined significantly beginning in March 2020 before reaching a low of 244 in August 2020. During 2021, oil prices rebounded, and the average U.S. rig count gradually increased, resulting in a 10% year-over-year improvement in U.S. rig count. We anticipate that market activity will continue to improve in 2022, although the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 variants, an uncertain economic environment, including widespread supply chain disruptions, as well as enacted and proposed legislative changes in the U.S. impacting the oil and natural gas industry, make the timing and pace of recovery difficult to predict.
Outside of North America land markets, drilling activity is generally more stable as this drilling activity is based on longer-term economic projections and multi-year drilling programs, which typically reduces the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity. However, operations in several countries in the EMEA region experienced activity disruptions and project delays beginning in early 2020 and continuing through 2021, driven by government-imposed restrictions on movements of personnel, quarantines of staffing, and logistical limitations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues and profitability from our international Fluids Systems business have gradually recovered in 2021, with revenues for the fourth quarter 2021 approaching pre-COVID levels. Although the impacts of COVID-19 on our international operations has significantly declined in recent months, we expect some level of operational disruption and project delays will continue to impact international activity levels in the near-term, with the impact from the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and related government responses very difficult to predict.
Strategy
Our long-term strategy includes key foundational elements that are intended to enhance long-term shareholder value creation:
•End-market diversification – To help reduce our dependency on customers in the volatile E&P industry, improve the stability in cash flow generation and returns on invested capital, and provide growth opportunities into new markets, we have focused our efforts over the past several years on diversifying our presence outside of our historical E&P customer base. These efforts have been primarily focused within our Site and Access Solutions business, where we have prioritized growth in power transmission, pipeline, renewable energy, and construction markets. The continued expansion of revenues in industrial markets, and particularly end-markets that are likely to benefit from ongoing energy transition efforts around the world, such as power transmission, renewable energy, and geothermal, remains a strategic priority going forward, and we anticipate that our capital investments will primarily focus on supporting this objective.
•Provide products that enhance environmental sustainability – Our Company has a long history of providing environmentally-sensitive technologies to our customers. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we believe the lightweight design of our fully recyclable DURA-BASE® matting system provides a distinct environmental advantage for our customers as compared to alternative wood mat products in the market, by eliminating deforestation required to produce wood mat products while also reducing CO2 emissions associated with product transportation. In our Fluids Systems segment, our family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution® and DeepDrill® systems, are designed to enhance drilling performance while also providing a variety of environmental benefits relative to traditional oil-based fluids. More recently, our Fluids Systems segment has also developed the TerraThermTM water-based fluids system designed specifically for clean-energy geothermal drilling, as well as the TransitionTM family of brine-tolerant stimulation chemicals, which reduce the freshwater required for well stimulation applications. The continued advancement of technology that provides our customers with economic benefits, while also enhancing their environmental and safety programs, remains a priority for our research and development efforts.
With ongoing support from outside financial and other advisors, we have continuously reviewed our portfolio during the oil and natural gas cycle of the last couple of years. These reviews have focused on evaluating changes in the outlook for our served markets and customer priorities, while identifying opportunities for value-creating options in our portfolio, as well as placing investment emphasis in markets where we generate strong returns and where we see greater long-term viability and stability. While we have taken certain actions to reduce our workforce and cost structure, our business contains high levels of fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expense. In February 2022, our management recommended and our Board of Directors approved a plan to wind down our Industrial Blending operations and pursue the sale of the industrial blending and warehouse facility and related equipment, and our Board of Directors also approved management’s plan to explore strategic options for our U.S. mineral grinding business. We continue to evaluate other under-performing areas of our business, particularly within the U.S. and Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas markets, which necessitates consideration of broader structural changes to transform this business for the new market realities. In the absence of a longer-term increase in

activity levels, we may incur future charges related to these efforts or potential asset impairments, which may negatively impact our future results.
Reportable Segments
Industrial Solutions
Our Industrial Solutions segment provides temporary worksite access, including the rental of our manufactured recyclable composite matting systems, along with related site construction and services to customers in various markets including power transmission, E&P, pipeline, renewable energy, petrochemical, construction and other industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. We also manufacture and sell our recyclable DURA-BASE® Advanced Composite Mats to customers around the world, with power transmission being the primary end-market. 
We have also developed system enhancements, including the EPZ Grounding System™ for enhanced safety and efficiency for workers on power line maintenance and construction projects. We continue to make investments in matting and component innovation to deliver further differentiation and enhanced environmental benefits. 
In addition, we began leveraging our capacity and technical expertise in chemical blending into industrial blending operations, and in response to the increasing market demand for cleaning products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, began producing disinfectants and industrial cleaning products in 2020. The scale-up of production was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020, which effectively repositioned our chemical blending operation located in Conroe, Texas to support industrial end-markets. Beginning prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2020, the assets and operating results associated with these industrial blending operations are included in the Industrial Solutions segment, while the historical results from earlier in 2020, which were immaterial, are included in the Fluids Systems segment. As noted above, in February 2022, our management recommended and our Board of Directors approved a plan to wind down our Industrial Blending operations and pursue the sale of the industrial blending and warehouse facility and related equipment located in Conroe, Texas.
Raw Materials — The resins, chemicals, and other materials used to manufacture our recyclable composite mats are widely available. Resin is the largest material component in the manufacturing of our recyclable composite mat products. We believe that our sources of supply for materials used in our business are adequate for our needs. We are not dependent upon any one supplier, and we have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining any raw materials.
Technology — We have obtained patents related to the design and manufacturing of our recyclable DURA-BASE mats and several of the components, as well as other products and systems related to these mats (including the connecting pins and the EPZ Grounding System™), although certain key patents have since expired. Using proprietary technology and systems is an important aspect of our business strategy. We believe the lightweight design of our recyclable matting system provides a distinct environmental benefit for our customers as compared to alternative wood mat products in the market, by eliminating deforestation required to produce wood mat products and also reducing CO2 emissions associated with product transportation. While we continue to enhance the performance, environmental, and safety benefits of our products and add to our patent portfolio, we believe that our scale and reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements also have competitive significance in the markets we serve.
Competition — Our market is fragmented and competitive, with many competitors providing various forms of site preparation products and services. The composite mat sales component of our business is not as fragmented as the rental and services components with only a few competitors providing various alternatives to our DURA-BASE composite mat products, such as Signature Systems Group and Spartan Mat. This is due to many factors, including large capital start-up costs and proprietary technology associated with these products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include reputation, product capabilities, price, innovation through R&D, and reliability, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products, manufacturing expertise, services, and experience.
Customers — Our customers are principally utility companies, infrastructure construction companies, and oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. Wood mats and stone continue to be the primary solutions utilized for temporary worksite access across industries, though composite matting solutions continue to gain market share. During 2021, approximately 61% of our segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which our largest customer represented 10% of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 90% of its revenues domestically during 2021. Typically, we perform services either under short-term contracts or rental service agreements. As most agreements with our customers are cancelable upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Fluids Systems
Our Fluids Systems segment provides drilling, completion, and stimulation fluids products and related technical services to customers for oil, natural gas, and geothermal projects primarily in North America and EMEA, as well as certain countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America. We offer customized solutions for complex subsurface conditions such as horizontal, directional, geologically deep, or drilling in deep water. These projects require high levels of monitoring and technical support of the fluids system during the drilling process.
We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids systems, which serve to support our activities in certain regions of the U.S. drilling fluids market. We grind barite and other industrial minerals at four facilities, including locations in Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, and use the resulting products in our drilling fluids systems and also sell the products to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. In addition, we sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third-party industrial (non-oil and natural gas) markets. As noted above, in February 2022, our Board of Directors approved management’s plan to explore strategic options for our U.S. mineral grinding business.
Raw Materials — We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our fluids business are adequate for our needs. Our specialty mineral grinding business is our primary supplier of barite used in our North American fluids business. Our mills obtain raw barite ore under supply agreements from foreign sources, primarily China and India. We obtain other materials used in the fluids business from various third-party suppliers. We have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining these raw materials. 
Technology — Proprietary technology and systems are an important aspect of our business strategy. We seek patents and licenses on new developments whenever we believe it creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We own patent rights in a family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution® and DeepDrill® systems, which are designed to enhance drilling performance while also providing a variety of environmental benefits relative to traditional oil-based fluids. In addition, we have developed the TerraThermTM water-based fluids system designed specifically for clean-energy geothermal drilling, as well as the TransitionTM family of brine-tolerant stimulation chemicals, which reduce the freshwater required for well stimulation applications. We also rely on a variety of unpatented proprietary technologies and know-how in many of our applications. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements are of equal or greater competitive significance than our existing proprietary rights.
Competition — We face competition from larger companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their fluids systems. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us primarily on price and local relationships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include a combination of technical proficiency, reputation, price, reliability, quality, breadth of services offered, and experience, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our best-in-class customer experience and value enhancing products and services.
Customers — Our customers are principally major integrated and independent oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2021, approximately 48% of segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 54% of its revenues domestically during 2021. In North America, we primarily perform services either under short-term standard contracts or under “master” service agreements. Internationally, some customers issue multi-year contracts, but many are on a well-by-well or project basis. As most agreements with our customers can be terminated upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Human Capital
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for all employees and for those with whom we conduct business. We recognize our greatest assets are our people, and our long-term sustainability depends on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the highly talented individuals that make up the Newpark team, while protecting each other like family and sustaining the environment in which we work. We appreciate our people and their achievements as we recognize they are integral to fully implementing our business strategy, which directly translates to improving our long-term profitability and increasing shareholder value. 
As a global company, the Newpark team supporting our customers spans more than 20 countries, and more than half of our employees reside outside of the United States. Our global footprint provides natural diversity within our organization and serves as a foundation to support an inclusive approach to everything that we do. At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,565 full and part-time personnel, none of which are represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory and through various company-culture initiatives, strive to reinforce our commitment to our Core Values of safety, integrity, respect, excellence, and accountability. The following charts present the geographic composition of our revenues and workforce.
Governmental Regulations
Our business exposes us to regulatory risks associated with the various industries that we serve, including governmental regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general, as well as environmental, health, and safety regulations that have specific application to our business. Our activities are impacted by various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, and policies related to pollution control, health, and safety programs that are administered and enforced by regulatory agencies.
We have implemented various procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and reduce the risk of damage or loss. These include specified handling procedures and guidelines for waste, ongoing employee training, and monitoring, as well as maintaining insurance coverage. We also utilize a corporate-wide health, safety, and environmental management system (“HSEMS”). The HSEMS is designed to capture information related to the planning, decision-making, and general operations of environmental regulatory activities within our operations. We also use the HSEMS to capture the information generated by regularly scheduled independent audits that are performed to validate the findings of our internal monitoring and auditing procedures.
