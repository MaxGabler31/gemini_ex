Item 1.   Business
The following Business Section contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks, uncertainties and other factors including the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

General
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company working to develop innovative cancer medicines based on cell cycle, transcriptional regulation and mitosis control biology. We are a pioneer company in the field of cancer cell cycle biology with a vision to improve patient healthcare by translating insights in cancer biology into medicines that can overcome resistance and ultimately increase a patient’s overall survival.
The transcriptional regulation program is evaluating fadraciclib, a CDK2/9 inhibitor, in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The anti-mitotic program is evaluating CYC140, a PLK1 inhibitor, in advanced cancers. Our strategy is to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business based on a pipeline of novel drug candidates addressing oncology and hematology indications.
We have retained rights to commercialize our clinical development candidates and our business objective is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs. Substantially all our efforts to date have been devoted to performing research and development, conducting clinical trials, developing and acquiring intellectual property, raising capital and recruiting and training personnel.
Cell Cycle Control Biology
Loss of control of the cell cycle, the process by which cells grow and divide, lies at the heart of cancer. In normal cells, a complex set of interacting proteins tightly regulates progression through the phases of the cell cycle by which a cell grows, replicates its DNA and divides. This process also includes mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints, to ensure all necessary events of each cell cycle phase are completed before beginning the next phase. Specific isoforms of cyclin dependent kinases, or CDKs, and Polo-like Kinases, or PLKs, are some of the key regulators among the numerous genes and proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints. If checkpoint control events are not completed correctly, the cancer cells may commit suicide by a process of programmed cell death called apoptosis. We seek to enhance and facilitate apoptotic outcomes in cancer cells with the objective of containing the disease and benefitting patients with various cancers.
CDKs interact with proteins called cyclins to regulate cell cycle checkpoints and control transcription, DNA repair and metastatic spread. The discovery of CDKs and cyclins and their regulation of cell cycle checkpoint control were cited in the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Our founder, Professor Sir David Lane, PhD, an internationally recognized authority in cell cycle biology who discovered p53, a key tumor suppressor that malfunctions in about two-thirds of human cancers, first identified CDK2/9 inhibition as an optimal target profile for transcriptionally active CDK inhibitors. 
The lead drug in our transcriptional regulation program is fadraciclib (also known as CYC065), a CDK2/9 inhibitor.
Polo Kinases and other mitotic kinases were first discovered in fruit flies by our former Chief Scientist, Professor David Glover, PhD. PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase playing a central role in cell division, or mitosis. In particular, PLK1 regulates mitotic entry, spindle formation, mitotic exit, cytokinesis and is an important regulator of the DNA damage checkpoint. Cancer cells are much more sensitive to PLK1 depletion than normal cells with intact cell cycle checkpoints. Inhibiting PLK1 blocks proliferation by prolonged mitotic arrest followed by onset of cancer cell death.
The lead drug in our anti-mitotic program is CYC140, a PLK1 inhibitor.

In our DNA damage response, or DDR, program, we have also been developing sapacitabine, an orally available nucleoside analog.
Clinical Development Pipeline
Our pipeline of innovative medicines aims to provide safe and effective anticancer treatment options to patients combined with the convenience of oral administration. Although we initially evaluated both fadraciclib and CYC140 using intravenous, or i.v., administration our recent and planned Phase 1/2 clinical studies use oral administration. During the pandemic, hospitals severely restricted access for patients to clinical studies which in particular impacted those receiving i.v. treatment. Empirical data from our clinical studies also suggested that daily dosing by the oral route is a preferred strategy for both our drugs. We thus moved quickly to switch our studies from i.v. to oral administration of fadraciclib and CYC140. The aim of the current streamlined studies is to assess safety and identify signals of clinical activity which may lead to registration-enabling outcomes.
The following table summarizes our current development programs:

Transcriptional Regulation Program
Fadraciclib — Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) Inhibitor

6



CDKs are a family of enzymes first discovered as regulators of the cell cycle, but now understood to also provide pivotal functions in the regulation of transcription, DNA repair and metastatic spread. Different CDK inhibitor drugs selectively target different sets of CDKs. The precise selectivity of an individual CDK inhibitor molecule for certain specific CDKs is key to targeting particular tumor types and minimizing undesirable side effects through non-specific or off-target activity.
The best characterized CDK enzymes include CDK2, -4, -6 and -9. 
Following Professor Sir David Lane’s insights, our drug discovery and development programs concentrated on the CDK2/9 isoforms, which operate as key components of the p53 pathway. 
Pharmacological inhibition of the CDK2/9 isoforms, by medicines like fadraciclib, has been shown to have potent anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies against certain cancer types, including some that are resistant to approved treatments. It is hoped that treatment with fadraciclib will result in clinically relevant, tumor cell death in patients with selected cancer types. Fadraciclib inhibits CDK2, which is activated by Cyclin E, an oncogene to which cancer cells become addicted. CDK2/9 inhibitors may be able to overcome cyclin E-dependent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor plus hormone therapy regimens when given in combination with one or more of these agents.
The FDA approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, represent an important therapeutic advance and are associated with clinically meaningful survival advantages with good tolerability when combined with hormone therapy versus hormone therapy alone in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Recent clinical data show that treatment failure after CDK4/6 inhibitors is associated with amplification of cyclin E (Turner NC et al, JCO, 2019). Treatment of patients failing CDK4/6 inhibitors with CDK2/9 inhibitors, such as fadraciclib, may provide extended benefit to these patients. Preclinical data suggest that treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer cells resistant to standard of care trastuzumab with a combination of trastuzumab and fadraciclib results in regression of these difficult to treat cancer cells (Scaltriti M et al, PNAS, 2011).
Different CDKs are responsible for controlling different aspects of proliferation which, when dysregulated, can be drivers of particular cancer sub-sets. CDK2 and CDK9 inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. CDK2/9 inhibition may also overcome aberrant cell cycle control in certain non-malignant diseases of proliferation.
Fadraciclib targets:

● | CDK2, which drives cell cycle transition and is activated by Cyclin E.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CDK9, which regulates transcription of certain genes through phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II c-terminal domain Ser2., MCL1 mRNA and protein are labile (and turn over rapidly). Blocking CDK9-dependent transcription quickly leads to loss of MCL1 protein, resulting in apoptosis in MCL1-dependent cancer cells. Labile proteins rapidly depleted by short CDK9 inhibitor exposure include MCL1, MYCN, MYC, MYB, BCL2A1 and MDM2.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | MCL1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer acting as a survival and drug resistance mechanism.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | MYC proto-oncogenes encode MYC family proteins which are overexpressed in over 50% of human cancers often via gene amplification. MYC proteins are transcriptional regulators which promote cancer cell growth and survival by increasing the expression of target genes involved in cell metabolism and growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Multiple studies show that knockdown of MCL1 and/or MYC lead to cancer cell death and resensitization to drug treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fadraciclib is a selective, second-generation inhibitor of CDK2/9 that causes apoptotic death of cancer cells at sub-micromolar concentrations and is bioavailable via oral and intravenous routes. Antitumor efficacy has been achieved in preclinical models with once-a-day oral dosing at well tolerated doses. Translational biology data support development of fadraciclib in MCL1 dependent cancers. In a Phase 1, first-in-human study of fadraciclib, prolonged reduction of MCL1 for at least 24 hours was achieved and anticancer activity observed. Fadraciclib has been shown to inhibit CDK9-dependent oncogenic and leukemogenic pathways, including MYCN and mixed lineage leukemia rearrangements, or MLL-r. Fadraciclib suppresses the MCL1-mediated survival pathway in cancer cells, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis in MCL1 dependent cancer cells, and can reverse drug resistance associated with the addiction of cancer cells to cyclin E, a partner protein of CDK2.
Clinical development
Solid tumors
Advanced cancers (CYC065-01, i.v., NCT02552953)
Fadraciclib, using i.v. administration, has been evaluated in a first-in-human, single agent, ascending dose, Phase 1 trial to assess its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with advanced solid tumors. In part 1 of the study 26 patients were treated with fadraciclib as a 4-hour infusion once every 3 weeks. Part 2 tested a more intensive dosing regimen with 24 patients treated with fadraciclib as a 1-hour infusion or orally on days 1, 2, 8 and 9 every 3 weeks. One patient with MCL1 amplified endometrial cancer has experienced a confirmed partial response after 4 cycles and remains on fadraciclib monotherapy for more than two years with 100% reduction in target tumor lesions and a negative PET scan. Another patient with cyclin E amplified ovarian cancer has achieved cancer shrinkage of target tumor lesions of 29% after 4 cycles. In part 3 of the study high bioequivalence of an oral formulation of fadraciclib was reported at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium in October 2020. Dose limiting toxicities were reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, white blood cell lysis syndrome and its associated electrolyte abnormalities and liver enzyme elevations.
Supported by strong preclinical activity, the observation of durable suppression of MCL1 in patients and preliminary evidence of anticancer activity from this study, we have commenced a Phase 1/2 clinical study in a broad range of solid tumors. 
​
Advanced solid tumors and lymphomas (CYC065-101, dosed orally, NCT04983810)
​
The Phase 1/2 registration-directed trial uses a streamlined design and will first determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for single-agent, oral fadraciclib. Once RP2D has been established, the trial will immediately enter proof-of-concept, cohort stage, using a Simon 2-stage design, where single agent fadraciclib will be administered to patients in up to eight cohorts defined by histology thought to be sensitive to the drug’s mechanism of action and informed by the clinical activity of fadraciclib in previous studies. The cohorts will include patients with breast cancer (selected for metastatic, hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative, post-CDK4/6 inhibitor; HER-2 refractory; or triple negative), colorectal (including KRAS mutant), endometrial, hepatobiliary and ovarian cancers, and certain lymphomas. An additional basket cohort will enroll patients with mechanistically relevant biomarkers, including MCL1, MYC and cyclin E, regardless of histology. The protocol allows for expansion of a cohort based on response which may allow acceleration of the clinical development and registration plan for fadraciclib. Twelve patients have been dosed to date.
​
​
Leukemias
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CYC065-02, i.v., NCT03739554)
CLL cell survival depends on the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL1 and BCL2. In this context, targeting MCL1 or BCL2 releases pro-death signals and commits CLL cells to apoptosis. In preclinical studies, rapid cell death was induced in CLL and multiple myeloma patient-derived cell lines after short exposure to fadraciclib, even in the presence of stromal cells which confer protection from standard treatments. MCL1 down-regulation was observed,

consistent with the pro-apoptotic mechanism of fadraciclib. Fadraciclib synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models at clinically achievable concentrations, supporting the clinical investigation of combination regimens of fadraciclib and venetoclax.
In a Phase 1 study, i.v. fadraciclib was evaluated in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The study design and preliminary data were presented at a poster during the 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Fadraciclib was administered intravenously via four-hour infusion on days 1 and 15 in combination with daily oral venetoclax. Initial dose escalation is 33% and upon occurrence of the first dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, 25%. The primary objective is determination of a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, defined as the highest dose level at which less than one-third of at least six patients experience a DLT during the first treatment cycle. Treatment continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or changes in patient condition that renders patients ineligible for further treatment. Laboratory tests and CT scans were performed regularly to assess response according to standard criteria.
Of the five R/R CLL patients enrolled in CYC065-02 all had failed ibrutinib and one had also failed CAR-T cell treatment. Patients remained minimal residual disease, or MRD, positive after treatment ramp with single agent venetoclax for up to 5 weeks. Continuing shrinkage of enlarged lymph nodes was observed by CT scan on the combination of venetoclax and fadraciclib dosed once every two weeks. The patient who failed CAR-T cell therapy and two additional patients achieved MRD negative status on the combination.
Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML (CYC065-03, i.v., NCT04017546)
Drug resistance in AML has been attributed among others to high levels of MCL1. AML cell lines are highly sensitive to fadraciclib and 5 to 8 hours of treatment is sufficient to achieve induction of cell death. Fadraciclib has single agent efficacy in AML xenografts and the potential to be combined with approved AML therapies. In leukemia cells harboring the rearranged Mixed Lineage Leukemia gene (MLLr), fadraciclib reduced both MCL1 expression and CDK9 dependent transcription of MLL-regulated leukemogenic genes.
We completed enrolment in a Phase 1 study evaluating i.v. fadraciclib in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. The study design and preliminary data were presented at a poster during the 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Fadraciclib is being administered intravenously via four-hour infusion on days 1 and 15 in combination with daily venetoclax on days 1 to 15. Initial dose escalation is 33% and 25% upon occurrence of DLT. The primary objective is determination of RP2D defined as the highest dose level at which less than one-third of at least six patients experience a DLT during the first treatment cycle. Treatment continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or changes in patient condition that renders patients ineligible for further treatment. 
Four of twelve patients in CYC065-03 achieved decreases in leukemia blast cells in their peripheral blood as reported by investigators.
Leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (CYC065-102, dosed orally, NCT05168904)
​
This Phase 1/2 registration-directed trial uses a streamlined design and will first determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for single-agent, oral fadraciclib. Once RP2D has been established, the trial will immediately enter proof-of-concept, cohort stage, using a Simon 2-stage design. Oral fadraciclib, both as a single agent and in combinations, will be administered to patients in up to seven cohorts relevant to the drug’s mechanism of action and informed by the clinical activity of fadraciclib in previous studies.
Single-agent cohorts will include patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or MDS who have an inadequate response or have progressed on venetoclax combinations with hypomethylating agent (HMA) or low dose Ara C; relapsed/refractory AML or MDS patients with FLT3, KIT or MAPK pathways (including N and K RAS, BRAF, PTPN11, NF1). The trial will also include patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have progressed after at least two lines of therapy including a BTK inhibitor and venetoclax.

Combination cohorts for patients with AML or MDS are: fadraciclib and azacitidine for patients with AML or MDS who progressed with hypomethylating (HMA) treatments and also fadraciclib and venetoclax for patients that have progressed after venetoclax therapy. A further combination cohort of fadraciclib and venetoclax will enroll patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have progressed after venetoclax therapy. An additional basket cohort will evaluate patients with biomarkers relevant to the drug’s mechanism, including MCL1 and MYC.
The protocol allows for expansion of a cohort based on response which may allow acceleration of the clinical development and registration plan for fadraciclib. Two patients have been dosed on the study to date.
Published preclinical data
Preclinical data suggest that fadraciclib may benefit adults and children with hematological malignancies, including AML, acute lymphocytic leukemias, or ALL, and in particular leukemias with rearrangement of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia gene (MLL-r), CLL, B-cell lymphomas, multiple myelomas, and patients with certain solid tumors, including breast and uterine cancers, and neuroblastomas. 

● | Prolonged survival and reduced tumor burden in MYCN-addicted neuroblastoma
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MYCN oncogene is over-expressed in several types of cancer, most notably neuroblastoma, and also rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, Wilms’ tumor and small cell lung cancer. Amplification of MYCN is the most common genomic alteration in aggressive neuroblastoma and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Preclinical data presented at the 2016 Childhood Cancer Meeting demonstrated that fadraciclib prolonged survival in MYCN-addicted neuroblastoma models. Neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification and overexpression were found to be particularly sensitive. Treatment with fadraciclib was associated with inhibition of MYCN transcription, downregulation of MYCN protein, blocking neuroblastoma cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. There are no approved drugs that directly target MYCN, prompting investigation of indirect approaches such as suppression of MYCN gene expression via CDK9 inhibition, or exploitation of a synthetic lethal relationship between MYCN amplification/overexpression and inhibition of CDK2.

● | May reverse drug resistance associated with addiction of cancer cells to cyclin E, the partner protein of CDK2
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fadraciclib as a single agent can induce tumor growth delay in HER2-positive breast cancer cells addicted to cyclin E and resistant to trastuzumab, while administration of fadraciclib in combination with trastuzumab resulted in regression or sustained tumor growth inhibition.

● | May have activity in KRAS-mutated cancers
--+------------------------------------------

Researchers led by Frank McCormick, PhD of University of California San Francisco and NCI’s Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research reported that overactive KRAS mutants are impeded by CDK9 inhibition ( Pui Lai L, et al, SLAS Discovery I-II 2021). These data expand on previous publications which report that dual CDK2/9 inhibition is an optimal strategy to treat colorectal cancer (Somarelli JA, et al, Mol Cancer Ther, 2020), that KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer is sensitive to CDK9 inhibition (Blake DR, et al, Science Signalling, 2019), and that fadraciclib showed efficacy against KRAS mutant lung cancer in preclinical PDX models (Kawakami M, et al J Natl Cancer Inst, 2017). Collectively these publications suggest the potential for the therapeutic use of fadraciclib in KRAS-mutated cancers, including colorectal, lung and pancreatic.

● | Induces leukemia cell death and can combine beneficially with other anti-cancer drugs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fadraciclib targets key CDK9-dependent oncogenic and leukemogenic survival pathways. Data presented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research demonstrated strong synergy between, 

10



fadraciclib, and venetoclax in primary CLL, cells obtained from patients, including those with 17p deletions. In addition, the combination was active in two CLL samples which were resistant to either agent alone.
Data presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research demonstrated that fadraciclib can induce cell death and combine beneficially with anti-cancer drugs from the BCL2 and BET (Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain) inhibitor classes, in in vitro models of B-cell lymphoma, including double-hit lymphomas. Combinations of fadraciclib with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, or BET inhibitors were both synergistic. Short exposure to fadraciclib was sufficient to downregulate MYC and MCL1 and induce cell death. Fadraciclib treatment had no impact on BCL2 levels.
These findings support the hypothesis that dual targeting of the MCL1- and BCL2-dependent mechanisms could induce synergistic cell death by apoptosis and highlight an opportunity to rationally disrupt the pathways promoting survival of leukemia cells. 
Mitosis Regulation Program
Polo-Like-Kinase inhibitor — CYC140
In our Polo-like Kinase, or PLK, inhibitor program, we have discovered potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of PLK1. Polo Kinase was discovered by Professor David Glover, our former Chief Scientist. 
PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a central role in cell division, or the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, and is an important regulator of the DNA damage checkpoint. PLK1 over-expressing tumors include colorectal, esophageal, gastric, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, ovarian and squamous cell cancers, as well as MYC amplified cancers including breast. Recent data with another PLK1 inhibitor in clinical development, suggest that PLK1 inhibition may be effective in KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.
CYC140 is a novel, small molecule, selective, PLK1 inhibitor which has demonstrated potent and selective target inhibition (PLK1 IC50 ~ 3 nM) and impressive efficacy in human tumor xenografts at non-toxic doses. CYC140 has improved pharmaceutical properties over earlier, clinical stage, PLK inhibitors. Our translational biology program supports the development of CYC140 in acute leukemias and solid tumors. 
Clinical development
Advanced leukemias and MDS (140-01, i.v., NCT03884829)
Seven patients with advanced leukemias have been recruited in this first-in-human, single agent, dose escalation study of CYC140 given intravenously, and enrollment is completed. No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed.
Advanced solid tumors and lymphomas (CYC140-101, orally dosed)
​
Supported by strong preclinical activity we have opened a streamlined Phase 1/2 clinical study in a broad range of solid tumors. This Phase 1/2 registration-directed trial will determine in dose escalation the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for single-agent oral CYC140. Once RP2D has been established, the trial will immediately enter proof-of-concept, cohort stage, using a Simon 2-stage design. In this stage CYC140 will be administered to patients in up to seven mechanistically relevant cohorts plus a basket cohort which will enroll patients with biomarkers relevant to the drug’s mechanism.
This study is planned to be followed by a similar study to evaluate oral CYC140 in hematological malignancies. The aim of these studies is to identify clinical activity which may lead to registration-enabling studies.

Published preclinical data
Preclinical data presented at the 2016 28th EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium and at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research demonstrated the therapeutic potential of CYC140 as a targeted anti-cancer agent. The data demonstrated that CYC140 is a selective PLK1 inhibitor which is highly active against both solid and liquid cancer models, preferentially induces growth inhibition and cell death in malignant versus non-malignant cells.
Treatment of proliferating cells with CYC140 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of the PLK1 substrate phospho-nucleophosmin, accumulation of cells in mitosis and an increase in the proportion of mitotic cells with monopolar spindles, which are all features consistent with PLK1 inhibition. In a cell line panel derived from esophageal cancer and various non-malignant solid tissues, CYC140 was preferentially cytotoxic to malignant cells. Malignant cells which are sensitive to CYC140 undergo complete growth inhibition and induction of cell death in response to treatment. In contrast, non-malignant cells are only temporarily arrested and normal cell cycle transit is restored.
We have retained worldwide rights to commercialize CYC140.
DNA Damage Response program
Sapacitabine 
Both sapacitabine and CNDAC, its major metabolite, have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies. Sapacitabine is an orally available prodrug of CNDAC, which is a novel nucleoside analog, or a compound with a structure similar to a nucleoside. A prodrug is a compound that has a therapeutic effect after it is metabolized within the body. CNDAC has a significantly longer residence time in the blood when it is produced in the body through metabolism of sapacitabine than when it is given directly via intravenous administration. Sapacitabine acts through a novel mechanism whereby the compound interferes with DNA synthesis through the incorporation of CNDAC into DNA during replication or repair, triggering a beta-elimination reaction and leading to the formation of single-strand DNA breaks, or SSBs. During subsequent rounds of replication, SSBs are converted to double-strand breaks, or DSBs, which can be repaired by the homologous recombination, or HR, repair pathway, or, if unrepaired, result in cell death.
Sapacitabine has been evaluated in both hematological cancers and solid tumors. Over 1,000 patients have received sapacitabine in Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies.
We hold the worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine, except for Japan, for which Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., or Daiichi Sankyo, has a right of first negotiation. In 2008, sapacitabine received orphan drug designation for the treatment of AML and MDS from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which confers a range of benefits, including market exclusivity for a period of 10 years following approval for either indication. In 2010, FDA granted orphan drug designation to sapacitabine for the treatment of AML and MDS, which confers a range of benefits, including market exclusivity for a period of seven years from approval.
Clinical development
Sapacitabine and venetoclax
We have dosed 13 patients in a Phase 1/2 study (NCT01211457) evaluating sapacitabine in an oral combination regimen with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. This study is enrolling patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS with the primary objective of determining safety and efficacy of the combination. Secondary objectives include CR, CRp, PR, or major HI, duration of response, transfusion requirements, number of hospitalized days and overall survival.

Investigator sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of sapacitabine and olaparib in patients with BRCA mutant breast cancer
Approved treatments for advanced breast and ovarian cancer, including BRCA-mutated, include poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib and talazoparib. We believe that sapacitabine, possibly administered alongside a PARP or CDK inhibitor, may offer a complementary approach in this area of unmet medical need. Supported by data from a Phase 1/2 study and expansion cohort of sapacitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer, a combination regimen of sapacitabine and olaparib is being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored trial by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The trial is supported by us in terms of clinical supply of sapacitabine and AstraZeneca and will enroll approximately 64 patients with PARP inhibitor-naïve, metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 mutation (NCT03641755). Seven patients have been enrolled to date with two achieving partial response and five prolonged stable disease. The sponsor has notified us that they have decided to close this study for low enrollment.
Sapacitabine in AML
SEAMLESS, randomized Phase 3, pivotal trial of sapacitabine in elderly patients with AML
SEAMLESS was a multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of sapacitabine as a front-line treatment in 482 elderly patients aged 70 years or older with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for or have refused intensive induction chemotherapy. An investigational arm of oral sapacitabine administered in alternating cycles with intravenous decitabine was compared with a control arm of intravenous decitabine administered alone. Stratification factors at randomization were antecedent hematological disorders, baseline bone marrow blasts and baseline peripheral white blood cell counts. The study was chaired by Hagop M. Kantarjian, M.D., Chairman and Professor, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
On February 23, 2017, we announced that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival, or OS. An improved rate of complete remission, or CR, a secondary endpoint, was observed in patients who had discontinued therapy at the time of analysis. Other secondary endpoints and safety were similar between the arms. In the stratified subgroup of patients with low baseline peripheral white blood cell count, comprising approximately two-thirds of the population, a trend toward improvement in OS was observed for the experimental arm. The opposite was true for patients with high white blood cell count. SEAMLESS results were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal (Kantarjian HM et al, Results of a Randomized Phase 3 Study of Oral Sapacitabine in Elderly Patients with Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (SEAMLESS), Cancer 2021).
SEAMLESS completed enrollment in December 2014 with approximately 110 centers in the U.S. and Europe. In December 2014, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, conducted a planned interim analysis for futility after 247 events, or patient deaths, and reviewed safety of 470 randomized patients. Although no safety concerns were found, the planned futility boundary had been crossed and the DSMB determined that the study would be unlikely to reach statistically significant improvement in OS, but saw no reasons why recruited patients should discontinue and recommended that they stay on treatment. We therefore followed-up patients as per protocol until the prespecified 424 events had been observed.
Stratified and exploratory subgroup analyses have defined a patient population who may benefit from treatment with the experimental arm. We have received consistent scientific advice guidance from three European regulatory authorities regarding a potential approval pathway for sapacitabine. The discussions followed submission of statistical and exploratory analyses demonstrating sapacitabine’s potential clinical benefit in a subgroup of patients for whom the sapacitabine regimen may represent an improvement over low intensity treatment by decitabine alone. We have received validation of a Pediatric Investigation Plan submitted to EMA.
Investigator-Sponsored Trials (IST’s)
Preclinical data suggest that CDK2/9 inhibitors, such as fadraciclib and related molecules, arrest progress of the cell cycle and may benefit patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well as diseases of uncontrolled cell 

13



proliferation. Potential benefit was reported in glomerulonephritis, graft-versus-host disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Based on the data, investigators have requested clinical supplies of oral seliciclib, a precursor to fadraciclib, for ISTs.
Two ISTs are ongoing evaluating seliciclib in advanced endocrinologic and inflammatory indications. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, with grant support from The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases and FDA, is evaluating seliciclib in a Phase 2 IST in Cushing’s disease, characterized by high levels of cortisol and associated with pituitary tumors. In a Phase 1/2 IST, with grant support from the United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council, seliciclib is being evaluated as a treatment for advanced rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, by targeting proliferating fibroblasts. If confirmed, this may be a novel approach compared to standard of care RA therapies. 
Business Strategy
We plan to continue to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business focused on hematology and oncology based on a pipeline of novel drug candidates and utilizing our area of historical expertise in cancer cell cycle and mitosis biological mechanisms. Our clinical development strategy is focused on two ongoing programs in transcriptional regulation and mitosis control biology.
Focus on the cell cycle and cancer
Our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and our scientists include recognized leaders in this field. In addition, our senior management team has extensive experience in research, preclinical and clinical development and sales and marketing. The novel, mechanism-targeted cell cycle drugs we are developing are designed to be highly selective in comparison to conventional chemotherapies, potentially inducing death in cancer cells while sparing most normal cells which may give rise to fewer side-effects.
Thus, we believe that we are well placed to exploit the significant opportunities that this area offers for new drug discovery and development.
Develop anticancer drug candidates in all phases of the cell cycle and multiple compounds for particular cell cycle targets
Targeting a broad development program focused on multiple phases of the cell cycle allows us to minimize risk while maximizing the potential for success, and also to develop products that are complementary to one another.
Enter into partnering arrangements selectively, while developing our own sales and marketing capability
We currently retain virtually all marketing rights to the compounds associated with our clinical-stage drug programs. To optimize our commercial return, we intend to enter into selected partnering arrangements and to retain co-promotion rights as appropriate. Generally we plan to develop compounds through the Phase 2 proof-of-efficacy stage before seeking a partner. We may enter into partnering arrangements earlier than Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials where appropriate, or in connection with drug programs outside our core competency in oncology.
Licenses
Several of our programs are based on technology licensed from others. Our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to develop, test and commercialize our products may seriously harm our business.
In-license Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo
On September 10, 2003, we entered into a license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo with respect to patents and patent applications covering sapacitabine. Daiichi Sankyo filed patent applications claiming sapacitabine, certain crystalline forms and methods for its preparation and use which encompass our chosen commercial development form, as well as 

14



related know-how and materials. The license grants us the exclusive right to exploit and sublicense sapacitabine and any other products covered by the patents and patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo. The license was originally subject to certain third-party rights related to certain territories, but the license has since been expanded to a worldwide territory. The license agreement also grants to us nonexclusive, sublicensed rights to CNDAC, which is both a precursor compound and initial metabolite of sapacitabine.
We are under an obligation to use reasonable endeavors to develop a product and obtain regulatory approval to sell a product. We agreed to pay Daiichi Sankyo an up-front fee, reimbursement for Daiichi Sankyo’s enumerated expenses, milestone payments and royalties on a country-by-country basis. Under this agreement, $1.6 million was paid in April 2011, and further aggregate milestone payments totaling approximately $10.0 million could be payable subject to achievement of specific contractual milestones and our decision to continue with these projects. The up-front fee and certain past reimbursements have been paid. Royalties are payable in each country for the term of patent protection in the country or for ten years following the first commercial sale of licensed products in the country, whichever is later. Royalties are payable on net sales. Net sales are defined as the gross amount invoiced by us or our affiliates or licensees, less discounts, credits, taxes, shipping and bad debt losses. The agreement extends from its commencement date to the date on which no further amounts are owed under it. If we wish to appoint a third-party to develop or commercialize a sapacitabine-based product in Japan, within certain limitations, Daiichi Sankyo must be notified and given a right of first refusal to develop and/or commercialize in Japan. Effective July 11, 2011, the license was amended to irrevocably waive a termination right Daiichi Sankyo possessed under a provision of the agreement that required us to obtain regulatory approval to sell sapacitabine in at least one country by September 2011 and releases us from all claims and liability of any kind arising under such provision. The amendment further provides that the royalty fee due from us to Daiichi Sankyo on future net sales of sapacitabine be increased by a percentage between 1.25% and 1.50%, depending on the level of net sales of sapacitabine realized. In general, however, the license may be terminated by us for technical, scientific, efficacy, safety, or commercial reasons on six months’ notice, or twelve months if after a launch of a sapacitabine-based product, or by either party for material default.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We own 18 patents granted in the United States, 8 granted by the European Patent Office, or EPO, and 43 granted in other countries worldwide. In addition, we have a license to 23 patents granted in the US, by the EPO or worldwide.
We have 2 patent applications pending in the United States, 3 before the EPO, 24 pending patent applications in other countries and 2 pending PCT applications still in the international application phase. No assurances can be given that any patents will be issued with respect to the pending applications, nor that the claims will provide equivalent coverage in all jurisdictions. 
Intellectual Property Strategy
We consider intellectual property rights to be vital and use a variety of methods to secure, protect and evaluate these rights. These methods include ownership and enforcement of patent rights, patent applications, license agreements with third parties, invention assignment, confidentiality and non-compete agreements with key employees and consultants, material transfer agreements, and trademark protection.
We give priority to obtaining substance of matter claims in the United States, the EPO, Japan and other important markets if such protection is available. We prefer composition of matter claims because they provide us with rights to the compounds themselves, and not merely a particular use. In addition to composition of matter claims, we seek coverage for solid state forms, polymorphic and crystalline forms, medical uses, combination therapies, specific regimens, pharmaceutical forms of our compounds and synthetic routes where available and appropriate. Claims covering combination therapies, specific regimens and pharmaceutical forms can be valuable because the therapeutic effect of pharmaceuticals used in the anticancer field is often enhanced when individual therapeutics are used in particular combinations or dosed in a certain way. The availability of protection in these areas can, however, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and combination claims are particularly difficult to obtain for many inventions.

15



Since publications in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we are not certain of being first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or the first to file those patent applications. Generally, patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more, which increases the uncertainty we face. Moreover, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire, or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent and the commercial opportunity of the product.
If patents are issued to others containing valid claims that cover our compounds or their manufacture or use or screening assays related thereto, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. We are aware of several published patent applications, and understand that others may exist, that could support claims that, if granted and held valid, would cover various aspects of our developmental programs, including in some cases particular uses of our drug candidates fadraciclib, CYC140 and sapacitabine, or other therapeutic candidates, or substances, processes and techniques that we use in the course of our research and development and manufacturing operations.
In addition, we understand that other applications and patents exist relating to potential uses of fadraciclib, CYC140 and sapacitabine and that are not part of our current clinical programs for those compounds. Although we intend to continue to monitor the pending applications, it is not possible to predict whether these claims will ultimately be allowed or if they were allowed what their breadth would be. In addition, we may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. For example, in one case we opposed a European patent relating to human aurora kinase and the patent has been finally revoked (no appeal was filed). Litigation would create substantial costs. We are aware that other patents exist that claim substances, processes, techniques and methods of use, which, if held valid, could potentially restrict the scope of our research, development or manufacturing operations. If competitors prepare and file patent applications in the United States that claim technology that we also claim, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine which invention has priority. These proceedings could result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology, even a therapeutic product, if such licenses are unavailable or too expensive.
Issued patents for the fadraciclib compound cover the United States, EPO and eleven other countries. Issued patents for CYC140 cover the United States, EPO and seven other countries. 
Manufacturing
We have no in-house manufacturing capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production. We have no direct experience in manufacturing commercial quantities of any of our products, and we currently lack the resources or capability to manufacture any of our products on a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we are dependent on corporate partners, licensees or other third parties for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial scale quantities of all of our products. We believe that this strategy will enable us to direct operational and financial resources to the development of our product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing a manufacturing infrastructure.
Government Regulation
The FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drug candidates and commercialized drugs.

16



For example, in the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implement regulations. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP, regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical and other nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the adequacy of the preclinical testing or the proposed conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Our submission of an IND, or those of our collaborators, may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site and it must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, including those relating to informed consent.
Clinical Trials
For purposes of an NDA submission, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, which may overlap:

● | Phase 1: The clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. Phase 1 clinical trials can be designed to evaluate the impact of the drug candidate in combination with currently approved drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17




● | Phase 3: These clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal clinical trials. If the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are then undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct a Phase 4, which includes additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval.
New Drug Application
The results of drug candidate development, nonclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has six to ten months to review the application and respond to the applicant. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators do. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications or indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to a drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA’s fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and to expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast-track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast-track for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees.
Additionally, the fast-track designation may be rescinded by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
In some cases, a drug candidate may also qualify for one or more of the following programs:

18




● | Priority Review. Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is accepted for filing, if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. We cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will receive a priority review designation, or if a priority designation is received, that review or approval will be faster than conventional FDA procedures, or that the FDA will ultimately grant drug approval. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated Approval. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is authorized to approve drug candidates that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses, and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon either a surrogate endpoint that is expected to predict a clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than patient survival. In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to validate a surrogate endpoint or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. In rare instances the FDA may grant accelerated approval of an NDA based on Phase 2 data and require confirmatory Phase 3 studies to be conducted after approval and/or as a condition of maintaining approval. We can give no assurance that any of our drugs will be reviewed under such procedures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When appropriate, we and our collaborators, as applicable, may seek fast track designation or accelerated approval for our drug candidates. We cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will obtain a fast track or accelerated approval designation, or the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track or the accelerated approval process on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our drug candidates.
Satisfaction of FDA regulations and requirements or similar requirements of state, local and the EMA authorities typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Typically, if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our drug candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or EMA may not grant approvals for new indications for our drug candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
Special Protocol Assessment
If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed unless the sponsor fails to follow the agreed-upon protocol, data supporting the request are found to be false or incomplete, or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. Even if an SPA is agreed to, approval of the NDA is not guaranteed because a final determination that an agreed-upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy, or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data in the NDA.

19



Other regulatory requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA or EMA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA or EMA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug (pharmacovigilance). Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA or EMA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA or EMA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA or EMA regulatory requirements. If our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA or EMA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of that product.
The FDA or EMA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA or EMA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe approved drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA or EMA. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA or EMA generally does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA or EMA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are rapidly changing and highly competitive. We are seeking to develop and market drug candidates that will compete with other products and therapies that currently exist or are being developed. Other companies are actively seeking to develop products that have disease targets similar to those we are pursuing. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, competitors compete in the areas of recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses. Some of these factors can delay completion of recruitment into our clinical trials.
A large number of drug candidates are in development for the treatment of leukemia and lymphomas, MDS, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecological and thoracic cancers and other advanced solid tumors. Several biopharmaceutical companies have CDK or MCL1 inhibitors in clinical trials including Amgen, AstraZeneca, Blueprint, Cothera, Dainippon Sumitomo, Eli Lilly, G1 Therapeutics, Kronos Bio, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Otsuka, Pfizer, Prelude, Servier, Syros, Tiziana and Vincerx. Cardiff Oncology (formerly Trovagene) has a PLK1 inhibitor in clinical trials and we believe that Arbutus, Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Onconova, and Takeda have been and may continue to be evaluating PLK inhibitors for hemato-oncology indications. Several biopharmaceutical companies have nucleoside analogs on the market or in trials which may be competitive to sapacitabine in hemato-oncology indications including AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BMS, CTI Biopharma, Daiichi Sankyo, Jazz, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, MEI Pharma, Otsuka, Pfizer, Sanofi and Teva. Several companies are pursuing discovery and research activities in each of the other areas that are the subject of our research and drug development programs.

Environmental Social and Government (“ESG”) Matters
We recognize the importance of ESG matters, with a specific focus on Human Capital Management, as integral to creating a sustainable foundation for our long-term business strategy. We support professional development at all levels. We also take report of suspected violations of our codes of conduct and take seriously appropriate action. 
As we do not operate laboratories or manufacture products, we believe that our environmental impact is relatively small. We are involved in office waste reduction practices. Our mostly remote workforce has further reduced our carbon footprint. We strive to offer excellent benefits and long-term incentives to help retain our workforce.
Our human capital resources and objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards in order to increase shareholder value and our success by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities to achieve our objectives.
We recognize that our industry is specialized and dynamic and a significant aspect of our success is our continued ability to execute our human capital strategy of attracting, engaging, developing and retaining highly skilled talent. There is fierce competition both within our industry and in the geographic locations in which we have offices for highly skilled talent, and we offer a robust set of benefits, career-enhancing learning experiences and initiatives aligned with our mission, vision, and values in order to attract qualified prospective employees and to retain and motivate our employees. We offer competitive compensation for our employees and strongly embrace a pay for performance philosophy in setting and adjusting compensation. 
Our codes of conduct clearly outline our commitment to diversity and inclusion, where all employees are welcomed in an environment designed to make them feel comfortable, respected, and accepted regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. We have a set of policies explicitly setting forth our expectations for nondiscrimination and a harassment-free work environment. We are also a proud equal opportunity employer and cultivate a highly collaborative and entrepreneurial culture.
