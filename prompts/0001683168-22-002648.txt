Overview
 
The Company operates primarily through HyEdge, its wholly owned subsidiary, manufacturing and distributing HFactor water. HFactor water was created by Gail Levy, HyEdge's founder and CEO. Gail is a successful serial entrepreneur who was looking for a new product that could alleviate the toxic side effects of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs that had riddled a dear friend. As she researched the properties of hydrogen water, she became more and more enthralled by its potential.
 
Ms. Levy felt she could honor her friend by making hydrogen water immaculate, effective, and accessible to everyone. Enlivened by this mission, she collected a team of experts to help her engineer a natural process to combine hydrogen with water with zero impurities and optimal impact. In 2017, she launched her flagship product through retail and ecommerce channels.
 
HFactor was developed and is manufactured by a team of experts in the U.S. and utilizes a patented chemical-free and magnesium-free process to infuse free hydrogen into its water. Its award winning, environmentally friendly ergonomic pouch keeps the hydrogen potent and pure and makes it extremely portable.
 
HFactor's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits appeal to a wide population across every age group, positioning HFactor to capture significant share in an expanding market. The global market for bottled water is projected to reach $215B by 2025. HFactor has demonstrated significant market traction, with $2.87M sales in 2020, 30M+ followers across Social Media channels.
 
The quality of our product is achieved through a proprietary manufacturing process. A reverse osmosis filtering system and patent-protected infusion process ensures efficacy, purity, and taste. The efficacy of hydrogen water is backed by over 1,000 published studies demonstrating that hydrogen positively impacts fitness, health, lifestyle, recovery, and wellness.
 
Our sales strategy involves a diversified, multi-channel approach. Our products are currently on shelves in approximately 5,000+ retail stores across 20 chains in addition to our growing ecommerce presence. Our company prides itself on having a low carbon footprint, primarily due to our eco-conscious packaging and free mail-in recycling program through our partnership with Terracycle.
 
Mission Statement
 
To build a brand and corporate culture that, at its essence, exhibits strength in oneself and in one's community. We promote a foundation of "doing well by doing good". This foundation enables HFactor to produce and distribute the highest quality "better for you" consumer products that are conscious to the community, mind, body, and the environment.
The Worldwide Health and Fitness Movement
 
Consumers are looking for a go-to hydration option that provides additional functional benefits without the sugar or caffeine. The worldwide health and fitness movement is just beginning. More and more people are realizing the importance of what you put in your body and how you maintain it. On a greater scale, consumers are looking for brands that have removed artificial ingredients. This has led to a recent increase in contracts from major retailers and distributors in the US that should result in a significant increase to the Company's retail presence throughout 2021 and 2022.

Maintaining Relevance in a Digital World
 
HFactor has found success by establishing beneficial relationships with target-aligned influencers and sponsoring a multitude of events and activities. We have built organic relationships with athletes and influencers in the fitness space to drive awareness, education, and ecommerce. To solidify HFactor in the fitness space, we have had a strong presence at many sports and fitness events as participating sponsor, driving product trial and education. We expect that as we continue to cultivate these relationships, brand awareness will increase, and we will be able to capture a significant share in an expanding market.The Benefits of Hydrogen Infused Water
 
Water already has Hydrogen, as in H2O, but when those two hydrogen atoms are bound to oxygen, they are not available for any other interactions. When we infuse hydrogen gas into water, active hydrogen molecules are free and accessible to our body. Small and soluble, molecular hydrogen can quickly circulate and speed straight into the power centers of our cells. This interaction has been shown to increase athletic performance, reduce inflammation from exercise, and increase powerful antioxidants in our body. Our Reverse Osmosis filtering system ensures the purity and taste of our water, and our patented infusion process allows us to deliver PURE hydrogen and PURE water, and nothing else.
Our Products
 


The pouch. The pouch is unique, convenient to hold and carry, and plays a significant role in helping you reap all the benefits Hydrogen has to offer. The eco-conscious award-winning design and material was created in an effort to contain the additional Hydrogen in the water. When you add hydrogen to water, it tries to and usually does escape quite easily through more traditional materials such as plastic or glass Our pouch keeps the extra Hydrogen molecules contained, and does so with a lower carbon footprint.

The can. Slim, sleek, and eye-catching, the HFactor cans are finished with a matte white color so the blues and text information stand out on the shelf. Functionally, the aluminum material of the can is also very effective at containing the extra Hydrogen molecules. HFactor was the pioneer in delivering still water in a recyclable aluminum can.

More Flavors. More Sizes. More Choices. Recent innovations include a larger, 20-ounce pouch, in addition to different flavors of HFactor water such as Watermelon, Blood Orange, Honeydew, and Tart Cherry. While utilizing natural flavors with no sugar or calories these options offer consumers a great-tasting beverage that still provides the health benefits of our standard hydrogen-infused water.
Our Business Plan
 
HFactor's demonstrated efficacy, innovative packaging, and low carbon footprint has propelled traction since our launch in May 2017. Demand for multi-purpose functional beverages and a strong multi-channel sales strategy is driving HFactor's national reach. HFactor is a leader in the newly defined category of Functional Beverages and is well positioned as a business to maintain its competitive advantage in a new and growing space.
 
Our business plan focuses on four key areas: (1) regional focus; (2) retailer focus; (3) driving volume; and (4) controlling spending. We plan to focus on key regions of the US where our market traction is already established, including the Northeast, West Coast, Texas, and Florida. We also plan to aggressively cultivate the relationships we have with large retailers, including Walmart, Sprouts, Albertsons, Stop & Shop, and others. As we work towards these goals, we will strive to drive volume without losing sight of profitability as our main goal. We believe that as we focus on these four areas at once, we will be able to achieve sustained growth of the Company without compromising our profitability or the results of our operations.
