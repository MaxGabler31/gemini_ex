 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Our Company 
 The Company is a developer of minimally invasive medical devices that advance bariatric surgery to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. The Company’s current portfolio includes the LAP-BAND® Adjustable Gastric Banding System and the ReShape VestTM, an investigational device, to help treat more patients with obesity. Our vision is to be recognized as a leading medical technology company focused on the design, development and commercialization of transformative technology to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. Our Product Portfolio
 Lap-Band System
 The Lap-Band System, which we acquired from Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. (“Apollo”), in December 2018, is designed to provide minimally invasive long-term treatment of severe obesity and is an alternative to more invasive surgical stapling procedures such as the gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The Lap-Band System is an adjustable saline-filled silicone band that is laparoscopically placed around the upper part of the stomach through a small incision, creating a small pouch at the top of the stomach, which slows the passage of food and creates a sensation of fullness. The procedure can normally be performed as an outpatient procedure, where the patient is able to go home the day of the procedure without the need for an overnight hospital stay.
 The Lap-Band System has been in use in Europe since 1993 and received the CE mark in 1997. FDA approval for the Lap-Band System in the U.S. was obtained in 2001 and the Lap-Band System has been approved in many countries around the world. More than 860,000 Lap-Band Systems have been distributed worldwide.
 The Lap-Band System was approved for use in the U.S. for patients with Body Mass Index (“BMI”) greater than or equal to 40 or a BMI greater than or equal to 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions. In 2011, the U.S. FDA granted approval for an expanded indication for the Lap-Band System to include patients with a BMI in the range of 30 to 35 and with one or more comorbid conditions.
 The Lap-Band System has been subject to more than 400 peer-reviewed publications and extensive real-world experience. Adjustable gastric banding using the Lap-Band System has been reported to be significantly safer than gastric bypass while statistically producing the same weight loss five years after surgery when accompanied by an appropriate post-operative follow-up and adjustment protocol. Studies have reported sustained resolution or improvement in type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, arthritis, hypertension and other pre-existing obesity related comorbidities following gastric banding. The gastric banding surgical procedure is generally reimbursed by most payors and insurance programs that cover bariatric surgery.
 Benefits. Lap-Band System offers the following benefits:

· | Minimally Invasive. The Lap-Band System does not change anatomy and is removable or reversible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lifestyle Enhancing. The Lap-Band System helps patients lose weight and live a more comfortable life and potentially reduces co-morbidities from excess weight. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Durable Weight Loss. The Lap-Band System offers a sustainable solution that helps patients achieve long-term success. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ReShape Vest
 The ReShape Vest is an investigational, minimally invasive, laparoscopically implanted medical device being studied for weight loss in morbidly obese adults with a BMI of at least 35. The device wraps around the stomach, emulating the effect of conventional weight loss surgery, and is intended to enable gastric volume reduction. This device is designed to restrict the intake of food and provide the feeling of fullness without cutting or permanently removing portions of the stomach, or bypassing, any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The implantation of the device mimics a traditional weight‑loss surgery without permanently altering the anatomy and may not require vitamin supplementation.

 In a small pilot study conducted outside the United States, at 12 months, ReShape Vest patients demonstrated a mean percent excess weight loss (“%EWL”) of 85% and a mean percent total body weight loss of 30.2%, an average drop in HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) of 2.1 points, an average decrease of systolic blood pressure of 13mmHg, an average waist circumference reduction of 38 centimeters, or approximately 15 inches, and an average increase in HDL “good cholesterol” of 29 mg/dl.
 Benefits. The ReShape Vest, if approved for sale, would allow us to offer an additional weight loss solution that emulates the effect of conventional weight loss surgery through a procedure that is minimally invasive. The ReShape Vest potentially offers the following benefits:

· | Minimizes Changes to Normal Anatomy. The ReShape Vest emulates the effects of conventional weight‑loss surgery without stapling, cutting or removing any portion of the stomach. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Minimally Invasive Procedure. Unlike conventional weight loss surgery, which typically is performed in a hospital setting under general anesthesia and requires a hospital stay of up to four days, the ReShape Vest may result in shorter hospital stays. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Removable/Reversible. The ReShape Vest is designed to be removed laparoscopically, permitting the removal of the device at a later time, if that is desired. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allows Continued Ingestion and Digestion of Foods Found in a Typical, Healthy Diet. Because the ReShape Vest also leaves the digestive anatomy largely unaltered, patients are able to maintain a more consistent nutritional balance compared to conventional surgical approaches, thus allowing them to effect positive changes in their eating behavior in a non‑forced and potentially more consistent way. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The ReShape Vest will continue to be studied in upcoming trials in the US and internationally. In the U.S., we are currently planning a non-randomized trial enrolling approximately 250 patients at approximately 15-20 investigational sites with a 12-month primary endpoint (weight loss and safety) and 24 to 36-month follow-up. We intend to initiate that study in 2020 and our goal is to have FDA premarket approval (“PMA”) in the second half of 2022. Internationally, we initiated a non-randomized trial enrolling up to 95 patients at investigational sites in five countries (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Czech Republic) with a 12-month primary endpoint (weight loss and safety) and 24-month follow-up. We expect to obtain the CE mark by the third quarter of 2021.
 ReShape vBloc
 ReShape vBloc uses vBloc Therapy to block the gastrointestinal effects of the vagus nerve using high‑frequency, low‑energy electrical impulses to intermittently interrupt naturally occurring neural impulses on the vagus nerve between the brain and the digestive system. We are not currently actively marketing ReShape vBloc, although we continue to support existing patients and their physicians. We are also currently investigating a proprietary technique that would utilize our vBloc technology to stimulate nerves feeding into the pancreas while simultaneously blocking nerves feeding into the liver. The goal of the procedure is to increase release of the body’s natural insulin and to prevent glucose release from the liver into the blood stream.
 Our Strategic Focus
 Develop and Commercialize a Differentiated Portfolio of Products/Therapies
 An overarching strategy for our company is to develop and commercialize a product portfolio that is differentiated from our competition by offering transformative technologies to bariatric surgeons that consists of a selection of patient friendly, non-anatomy changing, lifestyle enhancing alternatives to traditional bariatric surgery that help patients achieve durable weight loss. With the Lap-Band System and the ReShape Vest (if approved for commercial use), we believe we have two compelling and differentiated medical devices. We believe that we are well positioned for the existing market 

 
  2

 
and can serve more of the overweight and obese population with our solutions and thereby help expand the addressable market for obesity.

 Drive the Adoption of Our Portfolio through Obesity Therapy Experts and Patient Ambassadors
 Our clinical development strategy is to collaborate closely with regulatory bodies, healthcare providers, obesity therapy experts and others involved in the obesity management process, patients and their advocates and scientific experts. We have established relationships with obesity therapy experts and healthcare providers, including physicians and hospitals, and have identified Lap-Band patient ambassadors and we believe these individuals will be important in promoting patient awareness and gaining widespread adoption of the Lap-Band and the ReShape Vest. Expand and Protect Our Intellectual Property Position
 We believe that our issued patents and our patent applications encompass a broad platform of therapies focused on obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other gastrointestinal disorders. We intend to continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications. Leverage our vBloc Technology for Other Disease States
 We intend to continue to conduct research and development for other potential applications for our vBloc Therapy and believe we have a broad technology platform that will support the development of additional clinical applications and therapies for other metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders in addition to obesity. Alternative Weight Loss Solutions
 If we are able to commercialize the ReShape Vest, we believe that we will be able to offer two distinct weight loss treatment solutions that may be selected by the physician depending on the severity of the patient’s BMI or condition. Together, the Lap-Band and ReShape Vest provide a minimally-invasive continuum of care for bariatric patients and their care providers.

 Our Market
 The Obesity and Metabolic Disease Epidemic
 Obesity is a disease that has been increasing at an alarming rate with significant medical repercussions and associated economic costs. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) currently estimates that more than 2.1 billion adults, approximately 30% of the global population, are overweight. The global economic impact of obesity is approximately $2 trillion, or approximately 2.8% of global GDP. Healthcare costs for severely or morbidly obese adults are 81% higher than for healthy weight adults and obesity is responsible for 5% of deaths worldwide. We believe our products and product candidates could address a $1.64 billion per year global surgical device market.
 We believe that this epidemic will continue to grow worldwide given dietary trends in developed nations that favor highly processed sugars, larger meals and fattier foods, as well as increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Despite the growing obesity rate, increasing public interest in the obesity epidemic and significant medical repercussions and economic costs associated with obesity, there continues to be a significant unmet need for effective treatments.
 The United States Market
 Obesity has been identified by the U.S. Surgeon General as the fastest growing cause of disease and death in the United States, and according to a 2014 McKinsey Report is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 160 million American adults are overweight or obese, 74 million American adults are overweight, 78 million American adults are obese or severely obese, and 24 million American adults are morbidly obese. It is estimated that if obesity rates stay consistent, 51% of the U.S. population will be obese by 2030. According to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, almost 80% of adults with a BMI above 30 have comorbidity, and almost 40% have two or more of these comorbidities. According to The Obesity Society and the CDC, obesity is associated with many significant weight‑related comorbidities including Type 2 diabetes, high blood‑pressure, sleep apnea, certain cancers, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis and stroke. According to the American Cancer Society, 572,000 Americans die of cancer each year, over one‑third of which are linked to excess body weight, poor nutrition and/or physical inactivity. Over 75% of hypertension cases are directly linked to obesity, and more than 90% of the approximately 28 million U.S. adults with Type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity.
 Currently, medical costs associated with obesity in the U.S. are estimated to be up to $210 billion per year and nearly 21% of medical costs in the U.S. can be attributed to obesity. An estimated approximately $1.5 billion was spent in 2015 alone in the U.S. on approximately 200,000 bariatric surgical procedures to treat obesity. By 2025, it is estimated that up to $3.8 billion will be spent in the U.S. on approximately 800,000 bariatric surgical procedures to treat obesity. Researchers estimate that if obesity trends continue, obesity related medical costs could rise by another $44‑$66 billion each year in the U.S. by 2030. The medical costs paid by third‑party payers for people who are obese were $2,741 per year, or 42% higher than those of people who are normal weight and the average cost to employers is $6,627 to $8,067 per year per obese employee (BMI of 35 to 40 and higher).
 Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 We believe existing bariatric surgery and endoscopic procedural options for the treatment of obesity have seen limited adoption to date, with approximately 1% of the obese population qualifying for treatment actually seeking treatment, due to patient concerns and potential side effects including permanently altered anatomy and morbidity.
 The principal treatment alternatives available today for obesity include:

· | Behavioral modification. Behavioral modification, which includes diet and exercise, is an important component in the treatment of obesity; however, most obese patients find it difficult to achieve and maintain significant weight loss with a regimen of diet and exercise alone. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pharmaceutical therapy. Pharmaceutical therapies often represent a first option in the treatment of obese patients but carry significant safety risks and may present troublesome side effects and compliance issues. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bariatric Surgery and Endoscopic Procedures. In more severe cases of obesity, patients may pursue more aggressive surgical treatment options such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. These procedures 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

promote weight loss by surgically restricting the stomach’s capacity and outlet size. While largely effective, these procedures generally result in major lifestyle changes, including dietary restrictions and food intolerances, and they may present substantial side effects and carry short‑ and long‑term safety and side effect risks that have limited their adoption.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Research and Development
 Current R&D Focus 
 We have an experienced research and development team, including clinical, regulatory affairs and quality assurance, comprised of scientists and mechanical engineers with significant clinical knowledge and expertise. Our research and development efforts are focused in the following major areas: 
· | supporting the current Lap-Band System;
--+----------------------------------------


· | testing and developing the ReShape Vest; and
--+---------------------------------------------


· | investigating ReShape vBloc for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which, if marketed, would require additional FDA approval through the PMA process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We have spent a significant portion of our capital resources on research and development. Our research and development expenses from continuing operations were $5.7 million in 2018 and $5.4 million in 2017.
 Our Competition 
 The market for obesity treatments is competitive, subject to technological change and significantly affected by new product development. Our primary competition in the obesity treatment market is currently from bariatric surgical procedures and from endoscopic procedures.
 Our Lap-Band System competes, and we expect that our ReShape Vest System will compete, with surgical obesity procedures, including gastric bypass, gastric balloons, sleeve gastrectomy and the endoscopic sleeve.  These current surgical procedures are performed in less than 1% of all eligible obese patients today. Current manufacturers of gastric balloon and suturing products that are approved in the United States include Apollo (ORBERA Intragastric Balloon System and OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System) and Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. (Obalon Balloon System). 
 In June 2016, Aspire Bariatrics, Inc. received FDA approval for the Aspire Assist® System, an endoscopic alternative to weight loss surgery for people with moderate to severe obesity. We are also aware that GI Dynamics, Inc. has received approvals in various international countries to sell its EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner. 
 We also compete against the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals that are directed at treating obesity and the 99% of obese patients eligible for surgery that are not willing to pursue a surgical option. We are aware of a number of drugs that are approved for long-term treatment of obesity in the United States: Orlistat, marketed by Roche as Xenical and GlaxoSmithKline as Alli, Belviq marketed by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Qsymia, marketed by VIVUS, Inc. and Contrave, marketed by Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc.  In addition, we are aware of a pivotal trial for GELESIS100 that is being conducted by Gelesis, Inc.
 In addition to competition from surgical obesity procedures, we compete with several private early-stage companies developing neurostimulation devices for application to the gastric region and related nerves for the treatment of obesity. Further, we know of two intragastric balloon companies either in clinical trials or working toward clinical trials in the US:  Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon and Allurion Technology’s Elipse Balloon. These companies may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 
 In addition, there are many larger potential competitors experimenting in the field of neurostimulation to treat various diseases and disorders. For example, Medtronic plc, which develops deep brain stimulators and spinal cord 

 
  5

 
stimulators, acquired TransNeuronix, which sought to treat obesity by stimulating the smooth muscle of the stomach wall and nearby tissue. St. Jude Medical, Inc., through its acquisition of Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, is developing spinal cord stimulators. LivaNova PLC is developing vagus nerve stimulators to modulate epileptic seizures and other neurological disorders. Boston Scientific Corporation, through its Advanced Bionics division, is developing neurostimulation devices such as spinal cord stimulators and cochlear implants. Ethicon-Endo Surgery acquired LivaNova PLC’s patents and patent applications pertaining to vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of obesity and two related comorbidities, diabetes and hypertension, in overweight patients. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

· | acceptance by healthcare professionals, patients and payers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | published rates of safety and efficacy;
--+----------------------------------------


· | reliability and high quality performance;
--+------------------------------------------


· | effectiveness at controlling comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | invasiveness and the inherent reversibility of the procedure or device;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cost and average selling price of products and relative rates of reimbursement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effective marketing, education, sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory and reimbursement expertise;
--+----------------------------------------


· | technological leadership and superiority; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | speed of product innovation and time to market.
--+------------------------------------------------

      Many of our competitors are larger than we are and are either publicly-traded or are divisions of publicly-traded companies, and they enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including: 
    
· | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


· | established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


· | greater experience in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, obtaining reimbursement and marketing approved products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater financial and human resources.
--+---------------------------------------

  As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products. 
 Market Opportunity 
 Given the limitations of behavioral modification, pharmaceutical therapy and traditional bariatric surgical approaches, we believe there is a substantial need for patient-friendly, safer, effective and durable solutions that: 
· | preserves normal anatomy;
--+--------------------------


· | are “non-punitive” in that they support continued ingestion and digestion of foods and micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals found in a typical, healthy diet while allowing the user to modify his or her eating
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  6

 

behavior appropriately without inducing punitive physical restrictions that physically force a limitation of food intake;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | minimize undesirable side-effects;
--+-----------------------------------


· | minimize the risks of re-operations, malnutrition and mortality; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduce the natural hunger drive of patients.
--+---------------------------------------------

      Our Intellectual Property
 In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that does not infringe our patents. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
 Lap-Band
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 101 total U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our Lap-Band System. The international patents and patent applications are in regions including the United States, Germany, France, Spain, the UK, Mexico, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Poland, Australia, and South Korea. The issued patents expire between the years 2020 and 2031.  
 We also have 226 total U.S. and international trademarks for the LAP-BAND brand name.
 ReShape Vest
 As of December 31, 2018, we had four granted U.S. patents and four granted foreign patents in China, Israel, Canada and Australia related to our ReShape Vest. The patents expire between the years 2029 and 2032.
 We also have U.S. and international trademark applications for the RESHAPE VEST brand name.
 Sales and Distribution 
 We market directly to patients but sell the Lap-Band System to select surgical centers throughout the United States and internationally that have patients that would like to treat obesity and its comorbidities. The surgical centers then sell our product to the patients and implant. Our sales representatives are supported by field clinical experts who are responsible for training, technical support, and other support services at various implant centers. Our sales representatives implement consumer marketing programs and provide surgical centers and implanting surgeons with educational patient materials. 
 In connection with our acquisition of the Lap-Band System in December 2018, we entered into a transition services agreement, supply agreement and distribution agreement with Apollo pursuant to which, among other things, Apollo will manufacture the Lap-Band product for us for up two years and Apollo will serve as our distributor of the Lap-Band product outside of the United States for up to one year.
 In order to support our Lap-Band sales efforts, we have increased the size of our dedicated U.S. sales team from two to six. We have also launched co-op marketing campaigns that allow us to partner with clinics in marketing efforts and use digital marketing to drive qualified leads to physicians. During the first half of 2019, our international sales efforts will be through a combination of distributor and direct sales channels, with a focus on top Lap-Band customers in Australia and Europe.
 On July 25, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Galvani Bioelectronics Limited (“Galvani”). Under the Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to modify our ReShape vBloc for use in pre-clinical research by Galvani 

 
  7

 
in exchange for payment for our development work and supply under this agreement. We retained all rights, title, and ownership in the intellectual property for the new device. Galvani was granted a right of first negotiation for the potential exclusive or non-exclusive supply by us of the developed device, exercisable at Galvani’s election. We have not collaborated with Galvani since late in 2017 and we do not have any further plans to re-engage any further research activities with them at this time.
 Our Manufacturers and Suppliers 
 We are party to a supply agreement with Apollo pursuant to which, among other things, Apollo will manufacture the Lap-Band product for us for up two years after our acquisition of the Lap-Band product, which was completed in December 2018.
 To date, all of the materials and components of our products, as well as any related outside services, are procured from qualified suppliers and contract manufacturers in accordance with our proprietary specifications. All of our key manufacturers and suppliers have experience working with commercial implantable device systems, are ISO certified and are regularly audited by various regulatory agencies including the FDA. Our key manufacturers and suppliers have a demonstrated record of compliance with international regulatory requirements. 
 Given that we rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our products, our ability to increase production going forward will depend upon the experience, certification levels and large scale production capabilities of our suppliers and manufacturers. Qualified suppliers and contract manufacturers have been and will continue to be selected to supply products on a commercial scale according to our proprietary specifications. Our FDA approval process required us to name and obtain approval for the suppliers of key components of the Lap-Band System. 
 Many of our parts are custom designed and require custom tooling and, as a result, we may not be able to quickly qualify and establish additional or replacement suppliers for the components of our products. Any new approvals of vendors required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in other international markets for our products as a result of the need to qualify or obtain alternate vendors for any of our components would delay our ability to sell and market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We believe that our current manufacturing and supply arrangements will be adequate to continue our ongoing commercial sales and our ongoing and planned clinical trials. In order to produce our products in the quantities we anticipate to meet future market demand, we will need our manufacturers and suppliers to increase, or scale up, manufacturing production and supply arrangements by a significant factor over the current level of production. There are technical challenges to scaling up manufacturing capacity and developing commercial-scale manufacturing facilities that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers and suppliers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary experience. If our manufacturers or suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to expand the launch of the product in the United States or launch the product internationally or to meet future demand, if at all. We may also represent only a small portion of our suppliers’ or manufacturers’ business and if they become capacity constrained, they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of our product, our revenue, business and financial prospects would be adversely affected.
 Government Regulations
 Device Classification and Regulations
 United States 
 Our products and products under development are regulated by the FDA as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and the regulations promulgated under the FFDCA. Pursuant to the FFDCA, the FDA regulates the research, design, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, production and advertising and promotion of medical devices in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant premarket approval for devices and criminal prosecution.

 Medical devices in the United States are classified into one of three classes, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the amount of risk and the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I, low risk, devices are subject to general controls (e.g., labeling and adherence to good manufacturing practices). Class II, intermediate risk, devices are subject to general controls and to special controls (e.g., performance standards, and premarket notification). Generally, Class III devices are those which must receive premarket approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness (e.g., life-sustaining, life-supporting and implantable devices, or new devices which have not been found substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices), and require clinical testing to ensure safety and effectiveness and FDA approval prior to marketing and distribution. The FDA also has the authority to require clinical testing of Class II devices. In both the United States and certain international markets, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and changes, such as the Modernization Act and the EU-Medical Device Regulations, which could and have altered the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our medical devices profitably. 
 The FFDCA provides two basic review procedures for medical devices. Certain products may qualify for a submission authorized by Section 510(k) of the FFDCA, where the manufacturer submits to the FDA a premarket notification of the manufacturer’s intention to commence marketing the product. The manufacturer must, among other things, establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a letter finding substantial equivalence. If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure, the manufacturer must file a PMA application with the FDA. This procedure requires more extensive pre-filing clinical and preclinical testing than the 510(k) procedure and involves a significantly longer FDA review process. A PMA is required to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device and a key component of a PMA submission is the pivotal clinical trial data, as discussed in more detail below.  
 Premarket Approval 
 Our ReShape vBloc and our Lap-Band System are medical devices that required PMAs from the FDA to market in the United States. The FDA approved ReShape vBloc in January of 2015 and the Lap-Band System in 2001 with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approvals. Even after approval of the PMAs, new PMAs or supplemental PMAs will be required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, use and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA. In addition, holders of an approved PMA are required to submit annual reports to the FDA that include relevant information on the continued use of the device. 
 The ReShape Vest will be considered a Class III Long Term Implantable (“LTI”) product by the FDA requiring the PMA path.  A pivotal trial for the ReShape Vest will likely include approximately 250 implanted patients monitored up to three years.  Other implantable devices for the treatment of obesity relied on twelve-month endpoints for the PMA submission with annual follow-up visits up to five years and we expect the pivotal trial for the ReShape Vest to be similar.  A US pivotal trial requires FDA Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) submission and approval.  
 Clinical Trials 
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA. Clinical trials for a “significant risk” device such as ours require submission to the FDA of an application for an IDE for clinical studies to be conducted within the United States. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Clinical trials for a significant risk device in the United States may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and by the Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) overseeing the clinical trial at the various investigational sites. 
 Clinical trials require extensive recordkeeping and detailed reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for each participating clinical trial site and in accordance with applicable regulations and policies including, but not limited to, the FDA’s good clinical practice IDE requirements. We, the trial Data Safety Monitoring Board, the FDA or the IRB for each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.

 Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Regulation 
 Numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

· | Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures during the design and manufacturing processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulations which govern product labels and labeling, prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notices of correction or removal and recall regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | periodic reporting of progress related to clinical trials, post approval studies required as conditions of PMA approval and relevant changes to information contained within the PMA approval; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reporting of transfers of value and payments to physicians and teaching hospitals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have resulted in enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 
     Compliance with regulatory requirements is enforced through periodic facility inspections by the FDA, which may be unannounced. Because we rely on contract manufacturing sites and service providers, these additional sites are also subject to these FDA inspections. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
    
· | warning letters or untitled letters;
--+-------------------------------------


· | fines, injunction and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------------------


· | recall or seizure of our products;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusing our request for premarket approval of new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawing premarket approvals that are already granted; and

  International Regulations 
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Community (“EEC”), which consists of 28 European Union (“EU”) member states encompassing nearly all the major countries in Europe. Additional countries that are not part of the EU, but are part of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EEC with respect to medical devices. The EEC has adopted Directive 90/385/EEC as amended by 

 
  10

 
2007/47/EC for active implantable medical devices and numerous standards that govern and harmonize the national laws and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices that are marketed in member states. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of the national law of the member state in which their Notified Body is located will be entitled to bear CE marking, indicating that the device conforms to applicable regulatory requirements, and, accordingly, can be commercially marketed within the EEA and other countries that recognize this mark for regulatory purposes. 
 The Lap-Band System was CE marked in 1997. The method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device, but for our Lap-Band System, the method involved a combination of self-assessment and issuance of declaration of conformity by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device, and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body of the design of the device and of our quality system. A Notified Body is a private commercial entity that is designated by the national government of a member state as being competent to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with applicable regulatory requirements. The assessment included, among other things, a clinical evaluation of the conformity of the device with applicable regulatory requirements. We use BSI as the Notified Body for our CE marking approval process.
 Continued compliance with CE marking requirements is enforced through periodic facility inspections by the Notified Body, which may be unannounced. Because we rely on contract manufacturing sites and service providers, these additional sites may also be subject to these Notified Body inspections. 
 Patient Privacy Laws 
 United States and various international laws have been evolving to protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records. These laws restrict the use and disclosure of certain patient health information. Enforcement actions, including financial penalties, related to patient privacy issues are globally increasing. The management of patient data may have an impact on certain clinical research activities and product design considerations.  Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 43 employees. All of these employees are located in the United States. 
 From time to time we also employ independent contractors, consultants and temporary employees to support our operations. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that our relations with our employees are good.  Executive Officers
