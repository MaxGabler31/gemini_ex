COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Life On Earth, Inc. (“LFER”) is an innovative brand incubator and accelerator focused on building and scaling concepts in the natural consumer products category. Our mission is to bring our strategic focus and long-term forward-looking vision to consumers in the health, wellness and active lifestyle spaces through superior branding, product quality, targeted acquisitions and retail experience in the functional beverage category.
 
Our objective is to grow as rapidly as possible (both organically and via strategic alliances and acquisitions) using the public capital markets for access to capital. The companies and assets sought by us will be those that already have market penetration in the following segments: (1) Sales (2) Marketing (3) Distribution network and (4) Manufacturing infrastructure in place;
 
Our management team has over 50 years of combined experience in the food and beverage industry. To further enhance the product portfolio of LFER we have acquired additional brands. In October 2017 LFER acquired Victoria’s Kitchen, LLC (“VK”) and on August 2, 2018 the Company acquired the Just Chill brand through an acquisition of the Chill Group LLC. While LFER also had Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) companies with the previous acquisitions of the Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. and the Giant Beverage Company the revised focus of the Company is on our brands. To allow the Company to focus its resources on their brands, LFER executed a sale of the Giant Beverage Company effective March 1, 2019. Subsequent to year end, LFER made the decision to discontinue the ESD operation to further concentrate its efforts and available resources to its core brands and any additional brands it acquires.
 
Corporate Overview
 
Life On Earth, Inc. (formerly Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.) was incorporated in April 2013.
 
In October 2013, we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage  , Inc. (“Gran Nevada”), an entity related through common management and ownership. The   agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in the United States with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement was for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five-year terms unless terminated. We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014. This agreement was renewed for an additional 5 years as per the agreement. During the years ended 2018 and 2019, the Company sold $506,581 and $73,592 respectively. These products were produced by a third party copacker and were not purchased from Gran Nevada. The decrease in sales from 2018 to 2019 was related to limited production capacity for the Gran Nevada Horchata that the company was producing. The availability of 3rd party copackers that can produce an Horchata are limited and it directly impacted the sales. As there is currently no copacking available for this product the Company does not know if they will be able to produce this product again in the future. 


In July, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of ESD in July 2016 allowed LFER to expand distribution on the West Coast. On June 21, 2019, LFER made the determination to discontinue the operations of ESD and further focus on the brand portfolio. The operations of ESD was  discontinued in fiscal 2020 and will be reflected in future statements.

In October 2017, LFER acquired Victoria’s Kitchen, LLC ("VK"). VK is a specialty beverage company that makes exceptional European-inspired drinks. VK’s beverages are natural and all the beverages are Gluten-Free, GMO-Free, Dairy-Free, Vegan and contain no artificial ingredients or preservatives. 
 
On  April 30th, 2018 , LFER acquired The Giant Beverage Company Inc. (“Giant” or “GBC”). Giant is a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) business that covers the five boroughs of New York City under an eight-route distribution system. GBC  serviced over 600 accounts in the five boroughs. Giant services mainly independent retailers but was  expanding to service authorized chain accounts.

On May 7, 2019, Life On Earth, Inc., GBC, and Frank Iemmiti and Anthony Iemmiti (“Frank and Anthony Iemmiti”) entered into a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that will resolve all existing disputes between the two parties and will also result in the sale of the ownership of Giant back to  Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Under the terms of the agreement, LFER deposited $50,000 into an Attorney’s Trust Account. Frank and Anthony Iemmiti have a continuing obligation to provide LFER with all financial information of Giant (the “Giant Financial Information”) that LFER needs to complete its SEC reporting requirements. On July 4, 2019 LFER and Frank and Anthony Iemmiti executed a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that at the closing LFER authorized the release of the $50,000 to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Also, at closing, LFER also paid Frank and Anthony Iemmiti the agreed upon consideration of $62,718 of LFER shares at $.16 per share. Lastly at the closing, with an effective date of March 2, 2019 LFER sold GBC to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti for 1,455,000 shares of LFER stock that they owned. The sale of the Giant Beverage Company to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti became effective March 1, 2019.

Sales and Distribution 
 
The Company currently markets and sells mainstream functional beverage products through 3rd party Direct Store Delivery (DSD)    platforms as well as through other distributors including KeHe Distributors, LLC (“KeHe”) and United Natural Foods, Incorporated “UNFI”. KeHe has a distribution network in more than 30,000 stores across North America. UNFI is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.
 The Company also sells it Victoria’s Kitchen brands and Just Chill brands direct to consumers via Amazon online. LFER is also actively seeking additional brands for its portfolio that are primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, natural nonalcoholic functional beverages that are targeted towards LFER’s active lifestyle consumers.
 
Production and Distribution
 
The Company does not directly manufacture our products, as we outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). After the product is manufactured, the finished products are stored in third-party warehouses. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. As we are using third party co-packers and do not have minimum production contracts in place, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We continually review our contract packing needs in light of regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs. These co-packers are located in different geographic locations throughout the United States and currently the Company uses multiple co-packers. The material terms of these relationships are typically negotiated annually and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third-party distribution needs and also have long-term relationships with each of our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.
 
The contractual arrangements with all third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.
 Competition

LFER is a Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) company primarily focused in the beverage category. What sets us apart in the industry, is our consolidated corporate structure that handles all aspects of sales, marketing and proprietary distribution from a centralized location. The LFER platform is built for accelerating emerging growth brands in the United States by leveraging sales, supply chain, and distribution relationships. At LFER, we are forward-thinking. We have identified ways to build out distribution channels that are more flexible and responsive to today’s needs.
 
We realize that by sharing resources and capabilities in novel ways with new products in new situations, we can take advantage of profit-making opportunities that individual companies could not exploit alone. Our creation of a more flexible and responsive distribution system is not only a concept; we have applied the practice through implementation with our own functional beverage brands.
 
The beverage industry, specifically the healthy beverage industry, and the direct selling industries are multi-billion-dollar industries which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share.
 The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase, and no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market position or expand our business.
 Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. However, we believe that, with our diverse product line, we will have the ability to obtain a large market share, and continue to generate sales and compete in the industry.

Government Regulation
 
Packaged beverage and juice products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet food labeling requirements. The Company’s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes   and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second major research and development effort is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on consumer insights and trends and competitive intensity in those segments. The Company’s mission to provide healthy functional beverages governs our development efforts.
Employees
 
The Company currently has 5 full  -time employees. Certain positions are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation . In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. The Company also outsources its logistics to third-parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.
Going Concern Qualification
 
Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $8,007,035  and $3,003,761 for the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities and the Company’s ability to raise additional capital to fund operations. At May 31, 2019, we had cash on hand of $111,053 and an accumulated deficit of ($14,875,376). See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Intellectual Property Protection

The Company has secured a registered trademark for its name and logo. LFER does have its trademark registered for Life On Earth Inc. As of the date of this annual report, we have the trademarks for our intellectual property. The Company also has trademarks registered for the Victoria’s Kitchen and Just Chill brands.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is no longer an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Stamps Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act ” ).
 To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirements to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
