Item 1. Business 
General
TriNet is a leading provider of human resources (HR) solutions for small to midsize businesses (SMBs). Under our co-employment model, we assume certain of the responsibilities of being an employer and help our clients mitigate certain employer-related risks and manage many of the complex and burdensome administrative and compliance responsibilities associated with employment. 
Our solutions include payroll processing, tax administration, employee benefits and an HR technology platform with online and mobile tools that allow our clients and worksite employees (WSEs) to store, view and manage their core HR-related information and efficiently conduct a variety of HR-related transactions anytime and anywhere. 
Leveraging our scale for the benefit of our clients is a key component of our business model. For example, we utilize our size and scale to provide our clients and WSEs access to a broad range of cost-effective employee benefit and insurance programs generally not available to individual SMBs. In addition, our service teams help with talent management, recruiting and training, performance management, employee onboarding and terminations, benefits enrollment and support, claims administration and employment practices risk management. We also monitor employer-related developments and assist clients in complying with applicable local, state and federal regulations.
Our strategy is to provide industry-specific products and services to help clients address their HR needs and allow them to focus on operating and growing their businesses. We believe our industry-oriented (vertical) approach is a key differentiator for us and delivers significant benefits to our clients. This allows our sales force, product development and service teams to tailor product and service offerings to the specific industry needs of our clients. As of December 31, 2017, we have introduced five verticals TriNet Financial Services, TriNet Life Sciences, TriNet Nonprofit, TriNet Technology, and TriNet Main Street and we intend to continue to develop and offer new industry vertical products in the future.
TriNet was founded in 1988 and has significantly grown the number of clients we serve, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we processed $37.1 billion in payroll payments for approximately 14,800 clients with about 325,000 WSEs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. 
Products and Services
We deliver a comprehensive suite of products and services, which allows our clients to administer and manage various HR-related functions, including compensation and benefits, payroll processing, employee data, health insurance and workers' compensation programs, and other transactional HR needs using our technology platform and HR, benefits and compliance expertise.
Our comprehensive HR products and solutions include the following common capabilities:

TECHNOLOGYPLATFORM | HR EXPERTISE | BENEFITS | COMPLIANCE

 Technology Platform
Our technology platform includes online and mobile tools that allow our clients and WSEs to store, view, and manage core HR information and administer a variety of HR transactions, such as payroll processing, tax administration, employee onboarding and termination, compensation reporting, expense management, and benefits enrollment and administration. In 2017, we made significant investments in our technology platform to provide our users with improved functionality, including online and mobile productivity tools, and to allow our platform to integrate more effectively with third-party software applications.

BUSINESS

Our strategy is to continue to invest in product development and improve the functionality, experience and ease of use of our products and services for our clients and WSEs. We will continue to design additional functionality into our core platform, retire legacy software systems inherited from acquisitions, and migrate clients on those legacy systems to our TriNet platform. We believe the continued improvement of our technology platform and the consolidation of legacy systems allows us to drive operating efficiencies and improve client user experience by providing a single, streamlined experience for accessing HR information and conducting HR transactions.
We invested approximately $74 million, $53 million and $39 million, during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, developing our technology solutions. 
 HR Expertise
We use the collective insights and experience of our teams of HR, benefits, risk management and compliance professionals to help clients mitigate many of the administrative, regulatory and practical risks associated with their responsibilities as employers. We assist our clients in running their business by providing a variety of HR services, from widely used services like employee onboarding and terminations, benefits enrollment and support, employment practices risk management and administration, talent management, recruiting and training, and performance management to more specialized services like immigration services. Each of our clients and WSEs have access to varying levels of service and support from our HR experts ranging from call center support for basic questions to pooled specialized resources and to onsite consulting and services, depending on the needs of the client and WSEs. In addition, our teams of in-house HR professionals can also provide additional, incremental consulting and other services upon request.
Under our vertical strategy, we seek to design our product and service offerings for specific industries by identifying common needs and leveraging scale and shared experience to provide more efficient and relevant offerings. For example, our fifth vertical product, TriNet Main Street, supports hospitality, retail, property management, and other similar industries. These industries are labor intensive and often operate from many disparate taxing and geographic locations. Based on the common needs of these industries, we have created time and attendance expertise, hiring and termination expertise, workers’ compensation safety consultants, and a compelling suite of benefit plans that are attractive to both our clients' executives and hourly workers.
 Benefits 
We offer our WSEs access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored benefit and insurance programs at a value that we believe most of our clients would be unable to obtain on their own. We utilize our scale to decrease costs associated with our programs and look for ways to leverage our scale to provide additional benefits to our WSEs. Our benefit and insurance programs are compliant with state, local, and federal regulations, and our benefit and insurance service offerings include plan design and administration, enrollment management, and WSE and client communications. 
Under our programs, we pay premiums to third-party insurance carriers for WSE insurance benefits and reimburse the insurance carriers and third-party administrators for claims payments made on our behalf within our insurance deductible layer, where applicable. 
Employee Benefit Plans: We sponsor and administer several fully insured, risk-based employee benefit plans, including group health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, and life insurance as an employer plan sponsor under Section 3(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). We also offer other benefit programs to our WSEs, including flexible spending accounts, retirement plans, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) benefits, individual life insurance, a legal services plan, commuter benefits, home insurance, critical illness insurance, pet insurance and auto insurance. For further discussion of our fully insured programs including policies where we reimburse our carriers for certain amounts relating to claims, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS

Workers' Compensation: We provide fully insured workers' compensation insurance coverage for our clients and WSEs through insurance policies that we negotiate with our third-party insurance carriers. Additionally, we help clients manage their risk by providing risk management services, including performing workplace assessment, safety consultation, accident investigation and other risk management services at our client locations to help prevent workplace accidents that could lead to claims. We also provide services to help remediate such claims when they occur.
We manage the deductible risk that we assume in connection with these policies by being selective in the types of businesses that we take on as new clients, by monitoring claims data and the performance of our carriers and third-party claims management services and vendors and by providing risk management services for existing clients. 
Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI): We provide EPLI coverage for our clients through insurance policies that we obtain from our third-party EPLI insurance carrier. These policies provide coverage for certain claims that arise in the course of the employment relationship such as discrimination, harassment, and certain other employee claims, with a per-claim retention amount. The retention amount is split between the client and TriNet, with the client generally paying its portion of the retention amount first.
While we do not provide legal representation to our clients, our clients can benefit from the extensive experience of our employment law specialists and HR professionals who assist clients in implementing HR best practices to avoid employment practices liability claims and in managing, processing and responding to such claims. For claims covered by our EPLI insurance, actual litigation defense is conducted by outside employment law firms with whom we and our EPLI carriers have previously negotiated rates, established billing guidelines and invoice review processes. We have also developed a case management protocol to efficiently and effectively defend such claims.
 Compliance
Our products and services are designed to help our clients comply with local, state and federal employment and benefit laws. We monitor employment-related developments and assist clients in complying with changing regulations and requirements at all levels, from changes in state and local employment laws, such as minimum wage and family leave ordinances, to sweeping federal reforms such as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Often these changes are staggered and require additional guidance from a variety of local, state or federal agencies, or result in complementary or responsive changes, making compliance a continuous challenge. Each component of our HR solutions is designed with compliance in mind, whether it is payroll processing and tax administration, HR services focused on creating a compliant workplace, or offering ACA-compliant benefit plans.
Our Co-Employment Model
We operate under a co-employment business model, under which employment-related responsibilities are contractually allocated between us and our clients. This model allows WSEs to receive the full benefit of our services, including our employee benefit plan offerings. Each of our clients enters into a client service agreement with us that defines the suite of professional and insurance services and benefits to be provided by us, the fees payable to us, and the division of responsibilities between us and our clients as co-employers. The division of responsibilities under our client service agreements is typically as follows:
TriNet Responsibilities 
We assume responsibility for, and manage certain risks associated with:

• | remittance to WSEs of salaries, wages and certain other compensation, as reported and paid to us by the client, related tax reporting and remittance to tax authorities and processing of garnishment and wage deduction orders. Unlike a payroll service provider, we issue each WSE a payroll check drawn on our bank accounts,


• | report the wages, withhold and deposit the associated payroll taxes as the employer for regulatory reporting and payroll tax returns,


• | provision and maintenance of workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation claims processing,


• | provision and administration of group health, welfare, and retirement benefits to WSEs under TriNet-sponsored insurance plans,


• | compliance with applicable law for employee benefits offered to WSEs,

BUSINESS


• | processing of unemployment claims, and


• | provision of certain HR policies, including an employee handbook describing the co-employment relationship.

Client Responsibilities 
Our clients are responsible for employment-related responsibilities that we do not assume, including: 

• | day-to-day management of their worksites and WSEs,


• | compliance with laws associated with the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, such as overtime pay and minimum wage law compliance,


• | accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of compensation and deduction information, including information relating to hours worked, rates of pay, salaries, wages and certain other compensation,


• | accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of information relating to workplace injuries, employee hires and termination, and certain other information relevant to TriNet’s services,


• | provision and administration of any employee benefits not provided by TriNet (e.g., equity incentive plans),


• | compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the clients' workplace and business, including work eligibility laws, laws relating to workplace safety or the environment, laws relating to family and medical leave, laws pertaining to employee organizing efforts and collective bargaining and employee termination notice requirements,


• | payment of TriNet invoices which include wages to WSEs and applicable employment taxes and service fees, and


• | all other matters for which TriNet does not assume responsibility under the client service agreement, such as intellectual property ownership and protection and liability for products produced and/or services provided.

As a result of our co-employment relationship with each of our WSEs, we are liable for payment of salary, wages and certain other compensation to the WSEs as reported and paid to us by the client and are responsible for providing specified employee benefits to such persons to the extent provided in each client service agreement and under federal and state law. In most instances, clients are required to remit payment prior to the applicable payroll date by wire transfer or automated clearinghouse transaction (ACH).
We also assume responsibility for payment and liability for the withholding and remittance of federal and state income and employment taxes with respect to salaries, wages and certain other compensation paid to WSEs, although we reserve the right to seek recourse against our clients for any liabilities arising out of their conduct. We perform these functions as the statutory employer for federal employment tax purposes, since our clients transfer legal control over these payroll functions to us. The laws that govern the payment of salaries, wages and related payroll taxes for our WSEs are very complex and the various federal, state and local laws that govern such payments can have significant differences. For example, except to the extent applicable federal and state laws otherwise provide, the client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations if we fail to remit taxes and the bonding security provided by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC) or other surety is not sufficient to satisfy the obligation. 
Sales and Marketing 
We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization. We have aligned our sales organization by industry vertical with the goal of growing profitable market share in our targeted industries. This vertical approach deepens our network of relationships and gives us an understanding of the unique HR needs facing SMBs in those industries. 
Our Vertical Approach
We believe that our vertical approach allows our sales force, product development and service teams to tailor product and service offerings to the specific industry needs of our clients. In addition to sales and marketing, our client services and product development teams are focused on specific industry verticals. We believe this vertical approach is an important competitive differentiator for TriNet and believe that it will deliver significant benefits to our clients.

BUSINESS

Our Sales Organization
Our sales representatives are supported by marketing, inside sales, lead generation efforts, and referral networks. 
We sponsor and participate in associations and events around the country and utilize these forums to target specific vertical and geographic markets. We also generate sales opportunities within key industry verticals, through marketing alliances and other indirect channels, such accounting firms, venture capital firms, incubators, insurance brokers, and other vertical market industry associations. Additionally, we utilize digital marketing programs, including digital advertising, search and email marketing, to create awareness and interest in our products. 
We have expanded our focus on various channel relationships and alliances that drive referrals to our direct sales force. Finally, our sales representatives benefit from building strong relationships with prospects during the sales and client service processes, resulting in referrals to new prospects as well as direct support through providing reference calls in regard to our products and services.
Legal and Regulatory 
Our business operates in a complex environment created by the numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to labor and employment matters, benefit plans and income and employment taxes. The following summarizes what we believe are the most important legal and regulatory aspects of our business: 
Federal Regulations
Employer Status 
We sponsor our employee benefit plan offerings as the “employer” of our WSEs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), and ERISA. The multiple definitions of “employer” under both the Code and ERISA are not clear and most are defined in part by complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we qualify as an “employer” of our WSEs in the U.S. under both the Code and ERISA, as well as various state regulations, but this status could be subject to challenge by various regulators. For additional information on employer status and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading - If we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.
Affordable Care Act and Health Care Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010. The ACA implemented sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2020, and many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the states. Passage of the 2017 TCJA in December 2017, eliminates the individual mandate tax penalty under the ACA beginning in 2019, while retaining employer ACA obligations. Further significant changes to health care statutes, regulations and policy at the federal, state and local levels could occur in 2018 and beyond, including the potential further modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. For additional information on the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading - Our business is subject to numerous complex state and federal laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could adversely affect our business.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
Maintaining the security of our WSEs information is important to TriNet as we sponsor employee benefit plans and may have access to personal health information of our WSEs. The manner in which we manage protected health information (PHI) is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act). HIPAA contains substantial restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI. Further, under the HITECH Act there are steep penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Our health plans are covered entities under HIPAA, and we are therefore required to comply with HIPAA's portability, privacy, and security requirements.

BUSINESS

To the extent possible, the health information we possess is anonymized and accessed through a secured third-party database. For additional information on the security of our clients' and WSEs' personal data and PHI and the potential impact to our business if we fail to protect our WSEs' PHI, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K, under the heading - Cyber-attacks or security breaches could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims or damage to our reputation.
Certified Professional Employer Organization (CPEO) Certification 
With passage of the Small Business Efficiency Act in 2014, the U.S. Congress created a federal framework for professional employer organizations (PEOs) who voluntarily become certified under this law. The IRS is accepting applications for PEOs to become certified under the Code. Even though final regulations for the certification program have not yet been issued, we have applied for certification.
State Regulations
Forty-two states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, certification or recognition of co-employers, and others are considering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring or ensuring the fiscal responsibility of PEOs, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers' compensation and other purposes under state laws. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements in those 42 states.
We must also comply with state unemployment tax requirements where our clients are located. State unemployment taxes are based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years’ compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client’s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds. 
We must also comply with general state tax laws, including payroll tax laws. As noted above, tax reform may lead to significant state tax law changes in 2018 and beyond.
Strategic Acquisitions
Historically, we have pursued strategic acquisitions to both expand our product capabilities and supplement our growth across geographies and certain industry verticals. Our acquisition targets have included PEOs and other HR solution providers as well as technology companies or technology product offerings to supplement or enhance our existing HR solutions. We intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that will enable us to add new clients and WSEs, expand our presence in certain geographies or industry verticals and offer our clients and WSEs more attractive products and services.
Client Industries and Geographies
Our clients are distributed across a variety of industries including technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, property management, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality. Our clients execute annual service contracts with us that automatically renew. Generally, our clients may cancel these contracts with thirty days' notice and we may cancel these contracts with thirty days' notice. 
We conduct our business primarily in the United States of America (U.S.), with more than 99% of our total revenues being attributable to WSEs in the U.S. and the remainder being attributable to WSEs in Canada. Substantially all our long-lived assets are located in the U.S.
Seasonality 
Our business is affected by seasonality in client business activity and WSE product selection during benefits open enrollment. Clients generally change their payroll service providers at the beginning of the payroll tax year and as a result, we have historically experienced our highest volumes of new and exiting clients in the month of January. Other periods of significant client turn-over coincide with the timing of benefit program renewals.

BUSINESS

Competition 
We face significant competition in the form of companies serving their HR needs in both traditional and non-traditional manners. These forms of competition include:

• | Other PEOs that compete directly with us,


• | HR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that perform their own administration of employee benefits, payroll and HR,


• | providers of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits and business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and other third-party administrators,


• | employee benefit exchanges that provide benefits administration services over the Internet to companies that otherwise maintain their own employee benefit plans,


• | insurance brokers who allow third party HR systems to integrate with their platform, and

Our competitors include large PEOs such as the TotalSource unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., the PEO operations of Paychex, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as specialized and smaller PEOs and similar HR service providers with PEO operations. If, and to the extent that, we and other companies providing these services are successful in growing our businesses, we anticipate that future competitors will enter this industry. 
We believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of our ability to provide access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored workers' compensation, health insurance and other benefits programs on a cost-effective basis. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of this coverage in this regard, and our offerings must be priced competitively with those provided by these competitors in order for us to attract and retain our clients.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include client satisfaction, ease of client setup and on-boarding, breadth and depth of benefit plans, vertical market expertise, total cost of service, brand awareness and reputation, ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly, online and mobile solutions, and subject matter expertise. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of each of these factors.
Intellectual Property 
We own or license from third parties various computer software, as well as other intellectual property rights, used in our business. Generally, we protect our intellectual property rights through the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and policies with our employees and third-party partners and vendors, although we currently have one pending U.S. patent application covering our technology. We also own registered trademarks in the U.S., Canada and the European Union covering our name and other trademarks and logos that we believe are materially important to our operations.
Corporate Employees 
We refer to our employees that are not co-employed with our clients as our corporate employees. We had approximately 2,700 corporate employees as of December 31, 2017. None of our corporate employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Corporate and Other Available Information
We were incorporated in 1988 as TriNet Employer Group, Inc., a California corporation. We reincorporated as TriNet Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation, in 2000 and during that year changed our name to TriNet Group, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 1100 San Leandro Blvd., Suite 400, San Leandro, CA 94577 and our telephone number is (510) 352-5000. Our website address is www.trinet.com.
