Since its founding in 1986, RMR LLC has substantially grown assets under management and the number of real estate businesses it manages. As of September 30, 2022, we had $37.3 billion of assets under management.
Our business primarily consists of providing management services to four publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts, or REITs, whose securities are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq: Diversified Healthcare Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or DHC; Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or ILPT; Office Properties Income Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or OPI; and Service Properties Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or SVC.

ALR, Sonesta and TA are collectively referred to as the Managed Operating Companies.
As manager of the Managed Equity REITs, we are responsible for implementing investment strategies and managing day to day operations, subject to supervision and oversight by each Managed Equity REIT’s board of trustees. The Managed Equity REITs have no employees, and we provide the personnel and services necessary for each Managed Equity REIT to conduct its business. The Managed Equity REITs invest in diverse income producing properties across multiple real estate asset classes as follows:

The Managed Equity REITs, SEVN and, until September 30, 2021, TRMT, are collectively referred to as the Managed REITs or the Managed Public Real Estate Capital clients. 
In addition, RMR LLC provides management services to private capital vehicles, including ABP Trust and its subsidiaries, or collectively ABP Trust, and other private entities that own commercial real estate, of which certain of our Managed Equity REITs own minority equity interests. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to these clients as the Managed Private Real Estate Capital clients.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to provide an expanded range of management services to our existing clients, as well as to diversify the number of clients to which we provide services and the sources of capital upon which those clients may rely for growth.
We believe that we have several strengths that distinguish our business from other alternative asset managers:
•Revenue Base. Our revenues are primarily earned from long term agreements with credit quality companies, many of which are permanent capital vehicles. Our agreements with the Managed Equity REITs are 20 year term evergreen contracts with significant termination fees payable in certain circumstances. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, revenues earned from the Managed Equity REITs represented 74.1% of our total management and advisory services revenue.
•Strong Operating Margins and Resulting Cash Flows. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we continued to generate strong operating margins resulting in net cash from operating activities of $101.3 million and net income of $77.5 million. We have no debt outstanding. Our regular dividend of $0.40 per share per quarter ($1.60 per share per year) has been well covered by our cash flows.
•Diverse Portfolio of Managed Real Estate. We provide management services to a wide range of real estate assets and businesses that include healthcare facilities, senior living and other apartments, hotels, office buildings, industrial buildings, leased lands, net-lease service and necessity-based retail, including travel centers, and various specialized properties such as properties leased to government tenants and properties specially designed for medical and biotech research. The properties and businesses we managed as of September 30, 2022, are located throughout the United States in 46 states and Washington D.C., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The diversity of our managed portfolio helps provide balance throughout economic cycles, as the impacts to each respective real estate sector can vary.
•Growth. Since the founding of RMR LLC in 1986, we have substantially grown our assets under management and the number and variety of real estate businesses we manage. As of September 30, 2022, we had $37.3 billion of assets under management, including 2,100 properties. The synergies among our clients may also facilitate their and 
our growth. We assist our clients in realizing investment opportunities by working together to make acquisitions, obtain financing, identifying possible joint venture partners, completing redevelopment activities, facilitating capital recycling from strategic property dispositions and assisting in portfolio repositioning and other business arrangements and strategic restructurings. 
In addition, we expect to use cash on hand, future operating cash flows and may issue equity or incur debt to fund our growth and diversify our operations through possible acquisition opportunities or seeding new clients. In recent years, we sought to expand the sources of capital underlying our assets under management, with our Managed Private Real Estate Capital clients representing $3.9 billion of our assets under management as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $2.6 billion from September 30, 2021.
•Quality and Depth of Management. Our highly qualified and experienced management team provides a broad base of deep expertise to our clients. Our senior management has worked together through several business cycles in which they acquired, financed, managed and disposed of real estate assets and started real estate businesses. We are a vertically integrated manager and as of September 30, 2022, we employed over 600 real estate professionals in more than 30 offices throughout the United States. Additionally, the clients we manage collectively had approximately $12.2 billion of annual revenues and over 38,000 employees at September 30, 2022. We have also assisted our clients to grow by successfully accessing the capital markets; since our founding in 1986, our clients have successfully completed over $42.0 billion of financing in approximately 185 capital raising transactions.
•Alignment of Interests. We believe our structure fosters strong alignment of interests between our principal executive officer and our shareholders because our principal executive officer, Adam D. Portnoy, has a 51.2% economic interest in RMR LLC. Alignment of interests also exists between us and our Managed Equity REITs due to the manner upon which we earn base management fees and incentive management fees under our Management Agreements with the Managed Equity REITs, as described in more detail below.
We can provide no assurance that we will be able to implement our business strategy or achieve our desired growth. Our business and the businesses of our clients are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13.
Our Management Agreements with the Managed Equity REITs

Property Management Agreement Services
Under each property management agreement, subject to the overall management and supervision of the Board of Trustees of each Managed Equity REIT, RMR LLC is required to act as managing agent for each Managed Equity REIT’s properties and devote such time, attention and effort as may be appropriate to operate and manage the Managed Equity REIT’s properties in a diligent, orderly and efficient manner. 
Term and Termination
The business and property management agreements with each Managed Equity REIT automatically extend on December 31st of each year and have terms thereafter that end on the 20th anniversary of the date of each extension. A Managed Equity REIT has the right to terminate its management agreements with RMR LLC: (1) at any time upon 60 days’ written notice for convenience, (2) immediately upon written notice for cause, as defined in the agreements, (3) upon written notice given within 60 days after the end of an applicable calendar year for a performance reason, as defined in the agreements, and (4) by written notice during the 12 months following a manager change of control, as defined in the agreements. RMR LLC has the right to terminate the management agreements for good reason, as defined in the agreements.
If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for convenience, or if RMR LLC terminates a management agreement with a Managed Equity REIT for good reason, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to the sum of the present values of the monthly future fees, as defined in the agreement, payable for the remaining term of the agreement, assuming it had not been terminated. If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for a performance reason, as defined in the agreement, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC the termination fee calculated as described above, but assuming a remaining term of ten years.
The management agreements provide for certain adjustments to the termination fees if a Managed Equity REIT merges with another REIT to which RMR LLC is providing management services or if the Managed Equity REIT spins off a subsidiary to which it contributed properties and to which RMR LLC is providing management services both at the time of the spin off and on the date of the expiration or termination of either of the management agreements.
A Managed Equity REIT is not required to pay any termination fee if it terminates its business or property management agreements for cause, or as a result of a manager change of control, in each case as defined in such agreements.
Business Management Agreement Fees and Expense Reimbursement
Each business management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (i) an annual base management fee, payable monthly in arrears, and (ii) an annual incentive business management fee.
The annual base management fee generally is calculated as the lesser of:
•the sum of (a) 0.5% of the historical cost of transferred real estate assets, if any, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, plus (b) 0.7% of the average invested capital (exclusive of the transferred real estate assets), as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to $250.0 million, plus (c) 0.5% of the average invested capital exceeding $250.0 million; and
•the sum of (a) 0.7% of the average market capitalization, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to $250.0 million, plus (b) 0.5% of the average market capitalization exceeding $250.0 million.
The annual incentive business management fee payable by each Managed Equity REIT, if any, is calculated as follows:
•The incentive business management fee is calculated as an amount equal to 12.0% of the product of (a) the equity market capitalization of the Managed Equity REIT, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, on the last trading day of the year immediately prior to the measurement period, and (b) the amount, expressed as a percentage, by which the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share realized by its common shareholders (i.e. share price appreciation plus dividends) or the “total return per share,” exceeds the total shareholder return of a specified REIT index, the “benchmark return per share,” for the relevant measurement period, with each of (a) and (b) subject to adjustments for net common shares issued by the Managed Equity REIT during the measurement period. 
•The measurement period for an annual incentive business management fee is defined as the three year period ending on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being calculated.
•The specified REIT index utilized to calculate the benchmark return per share for each of our Managed Equity REITs when calculating the incentive business management fees is as follows:

 | For the Periods
 | | Through July 31, 2021 | On and After August 1, 2021 
DHC | | SNL U.S. REIT Healthcare Index | MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care Index 
ILPT | | SNL U.S. Industrial REIT Index | MSCI U.S. REIT/Industrial REIT Index 
OPI | | SNL U.S. Office REIT Index | MSCI U.S. REIT/Office REIT Index 
SVC | | SNL U.S. REIT Hotel Index | MSCI U.S. REIT/Hotel & Resort REIT Index

•No incentive business management fee is payable by the Managed Equity REIT unless its total return per share during the measurement period is positive.
•If the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share exceeds 12% per year in the measurement period, the benchmark return per share is adjusted to be the lesser of the total shareholder return of the specified REIT index for such measurement period and 12% per year, or the “adjusted benchmark return per share.” In instances where the adjusted benchmark return per share applies, the incentive fee will be reduced if the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share is between 200 basis points and 500 basis points below the specified REIT index in any year, by a low return factor, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, and there will be no incentive business management fee paid if, in these instances, the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share is more than 500 basis points below the specified REIT index in any year, determined on a cumulative basis (i.e., between 200 basis points and 500 basis points per year multiplied by the number of years in the measurement period and below the applicable market index).
•The incentive business management fee payable by the Managed Equity REIT is subject to a cap equal to the value of the number of its common shares which would, after issuance, represent (a) 1.5% of the number of its common shares outstanding on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being calculated multiplied by (b) the average closing price of its common shares during the 10 consecutive trading days having the highest average closing prices during the final 30 trading days of the relevant measurement period. 
•Incentive fees paid by the Managed Equity REIT for any measurement period may be subject to certain “clawback” if the financial statements of the Managed Equity REIT for that measurement period are restated due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws as a result of the bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of RMR LLC and the amount of the incentive fee paid by the Managed Equity REIT was greater than the amount it would have paid based on the restated financial statements.
If the business management agreement is terminated, the base business management fee and incentive business management fee due in respect of any partial period prior to the date of termination will be prorated as provided in the agreement.
Under each business management agreement: the Managed Equity REIT pays or reimburses RMR LLC for all of the expenses relating to the Managed Equity REIT’s activities, including the costs and expenses of investigating, acquiring, owning and disposing of its real estate (third party property diligence costs, appraisal, reporting, audit and legal fees), its costs of borrowing money, its costs of securities listing, transfer, registration and compliance with reporting requirements and its costs of third party professional services, including legal and accounting fees, and as otherwise agreed; and RMR LLC bears its general and administrative expenses relating to its performance of its obligations under the agreement, including expenses of its personnel, rent and other office expenses. Also, the allocable cost of internal audit services is reimbursed by each Managed Equity REIT to RMR LLC.
Property Management Agreement Fees and Expense Reimbursement
Each property management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for the following:
(i) a management fee equal to 3.0% of the gross rents collected from tenants, which is not applicable to any hotels, senior living communities or travel centers which are leased to, or managed by, a Managed Operating Company or another operating business such as a hotel management company or a senior living or healthcare services provider; and 
(ii) a construction supervision fee equal to 5.0% of the cost of any construction, renovation or repair activities at the Managed Equity REIT’s properties, other than ordinary maintenance and repairs, and 3% of the cost of any major capital project or repositionings at DHC’s senior living communities and SVC’s hotels.
Also, under each property management agreement, the Managed Equity REIT pays certain allocable expenses of RMR LLC in the performance of its duties, including wages for onsite property management personnel and allocated costs of centralized property management services.
Other Provisions
Under both the business and property management agreements, each Managed Equity REIT has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision of services was in bad faith or fraudulent, constituted willful misconduct or was grossly negligent. In addition, each management agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, will be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.
Our Management Agreements with the Managed Operating Companies
RMR LLC provides services and earns fees pursuant to a management agreement with each of the Managed Operating Companies. Under these agreements, RMR LLC provides services to the Managed Operating Companies relating to, or assists them with, among other things, their compliance with various laws and rules applicable to them, capital markets and financing activities, maintenance of their properties, selection of new business sites and evaluation of other business opportunities, accounting and financial reporting, internal audit, investor relations and general oversight of the company’s daily business activities, including legal and tax matters, human resources, insurance programs and management information systems.
Each Managed Operating Company pays RMR LLC a fee under its management agreement in an amount equal to 0.6% of: (i) in the case of ALR, ALR’s revenues from all sources reportable under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, less any revenues reportable by ALR with respect to properties for which it provides management services, plus the gross revenues at those properties determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) in the case of Sonesta, Sonesta’s revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, less any revenues reportable by Sonesta with respect to hotels for which it provides management services, plus the gross revenues at those hotels determined in accordance with GAAP; and (iii) in the case of TA, the sum of TA’s gross fuel margin, determined as TA’s fuel sales revenues less its cost of fuel sales, plus TA’s total nonfuel revenues. In addition, the management agreement with each Managed Operating Company provides that the compensation of senior executives of the Managed Operating Company, who are also employees or officers of RMR LLC, is the responsibility of the party to or on behalf of which the individual renders services. In the past, because at least 80.0% of each of these executives’ business time was devoted to services to the Managed Operating 
Company, 80.0% of these executives’ total cash compensation was paid by the Managed Operating Company and the remainder was paid by RMR LLC.
The terms of the management agreements with each Managed Operating Company end on December 31st of each year, and automatically extend for successive one year terms, unless RMR LLC or the applicable Managed Operating Company gives notice of non-renewal before the expiration of the applicable term. Also, a Managed Operating Company may terminate its management agreement at any time (i) for ALR and TA, on 60 days’ notice and RMR LLC may terminate such agreements at any time on 120 days’ notice and (ii) for Sonesta, on 30 days’ notice and RMR LLC may terminate its agreement with Sonesta on 30 days’ notice. If ALR or TA terminates or elects not to renew its agreement, other than for cause as defined in each agreement, the Managed Operating Company is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to 2.875 times the sum of the annual base management fee and the annual internal audit services expense, which amounts are based on averages during the 24 consecutive calendar months prior to the date of notice of nonrenewal or termination.
Each Managed Operating Company has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision of services was in bad faith or was grossly negligent. In addition, each agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, shall be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.
Our Management Agreements with the Managed Private Real Estate Capital Clients
RMR LLC provides management services to our Managed Private Real Estate Capital clients for which we receive, depending upon the services provided, a management fee based on a percentage of average invested capital, as defined in the applicable management agreements, a property management fee in an amount equal to 3.0% of rents collected from managed properties and a construction supervision fee in an amount equal to 5.0% of the cost of any construction, renovation or repair activities at the managed properties, other than ordinary maintenance and repairs.
Our Management Agreements with Advisory Clients
Tremont is party to a management agreement with SEVN. Pursuant to this agreement, Tremont provides SEVN with a continuous investment program, makes day to day investment decisions and generally manages the business affairs of SEVN in accordance with SEVN’s investment objectives and policies.
Tremont is compensated pursuant to its management agreement with SEVN at an annual rate of 1.5% of equity, as defined in the agreement. Tremont may also earn an incentive fee under this management agreement beginning the second calendar quarter of 2021 equal to the difference between: (a) the product of (i) 20% and (ii) the difference between (A) SEVN’s core earnings, as defined in the agreement, for the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters, if applicable), including the calendar quarter (or part thereof) for which the calculation of the incentive fee is being made, and (B) the product of (1) SEVN’s equity in the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters, if applicable), including the calendar quarter (or part thereof) for which the calculation of the incentive fee is being made, and (2) 7% per year and (b) the sum of any incentive fees paid to Tremont with respect to the first three calendar quarters of the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters preceding the applicable period, if applicable). No incentive fee shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless core earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters from January 5, 2021) in the aggregate is greater than zero. The incentive fee may not be less than zero.
The initial term of the management agreement with SEVN ends on December 31, 2023, and the agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms beginning January 1, 2024 and each January 1 thereafter, unless it is sooner terminated upon written notice delivered no later than 180 days prior to a renewal date by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the independent trustees of SEVN based upon a determination that (a) Tremont’s performance is unsatisfactory and materially detrimental to SEVN or (b) the base management fee and incentive fee, taken as a whole, payable to Tremont under the management agreement is not fair to SEVN (provided that in the instance of (b), Tremont will be afforded the opportunity to renegotiate the base management fee and incentive fee prior to termination). The management agreement may be terminated by Tremont before each annual renewal upon written notice delivered to the board of trustees of SEVN no later than 180 days prior to an annual renewal date.
In the event the management agreement is terminated by SEVN without a cause event or by Tremont for a material breach, SEVN will be required to pay Tremont a termination fee equal to (a) three times the sum of (i) the average annual 
base management fee and (ii) the average annual incentive fee, in each case paid or payable to Tremont during the 24 month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the date of termination or, if such termination occurs within 24 months of its initial commencement, the base management fee and the incentive fee will be annualized for such two year period based on such fees earned by Tremont during such period, plus (b) $1.6 million. In addition, the initial organizational costs related to TRMT’s formation and the costs of its initial public offering and the concurrent private placement that Tremont had paid pursuant to its management agreement with TRMT will be included in the “Termination Fee” under and as defined in SEVN’s management agreement with Tremont. No termination fee will be payable if the management agreement is terminated by SEVN for a cause event or by Tremont without SEVN’s material breach.
Tremont, and not SEVN, will be responsible for the costs of Tremont’s employees who provide services to SEVN, including the cost of Tremont’s personnel who originate SEVN’s loans, unless any such payment or reimbursement is specifically approved by a majority of the independent trustees of SEVN or is a shared services cost or relates to awards made under any equity compensation plan adopted by SEVN from time to time. SEVN is required to pay or to reimburse Tremont and its affiliates for all other costs and expenses of SEVN’s operations, including but not limited to, the costs of rent, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other overhead type expenses, the costs of legal, accounting, auditing, tax planning and tax return preparation, consulting services, diligence costs related to SEVN’s investments, investor relations expenses and other professional services, and other costs and expenses not specifically required under the management agreement to be borne by Tremont. Some of these overhead, professional and other services will be provided by RMR LLC pursuant to a shared services agreement between Tremont and RMR LLC. In addition, SEVN will also pay its pro rata costs of any combined directors and officers liability or other insurance programs arranged by RMR LLC for public companies managed by RMR LLC or its affiliates and SEVN’s pro rata portion of internal audit costs incurred by RMR LLC on behalf of SEVN and other public companies to which RMR LLC or its affiliates provides management services.

The Managed REITs have qualified and expect to continue to qualify to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, the Managed REITs generally distribute 100.0% of their taxable income to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes; and as REITs, such companies must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90.0% of their taxable income. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status, including share ownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If a Managed REIT fails to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if a Managed REIT qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.
Certain of our clients own or operate healthcare and senior living properties. These companies are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and material changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing laws. Some of the revenues received by these companies are paid by governmental programs which are also subject to periodic and material changes.
Certain of our clients own and operate hotels and some provide dining, food and beverage services, including the sale of alcoholic beverages. The operation of such properties is subject to numerous regulations by various governmental entities.
TA is also required to comply with federal and state regulations regarding the storage and sale of petroleum and natural gas products and franchising of petroleum retailers. In addition, as a result of TA’s involvement in gaming operations, TA and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania; and because SVC owns TA properties where gaming occurs, SVC is also subject to gaming regulations in some of those jurisdictions.
Tremont is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Advisers Act. Tremont provides investment advisory and administrative services to mortgage REITs, including SEVN, and may, in the future, provide such services to private funds that invest in commercial real estate debt. Employees of Tremont may also act as transaction originators for its non-investment advisory clients, which we refer to as the Tremont business. These activities result in certain aspects of our asset management business being supervised by the SEC and requires our compliance with numerous obligations, including record keeping requirements, operational procedures and disclosure obligations. SEVN intends to conduct its business in a manner that does not require its registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act, and to do so, may rely on any available exemption from registration, or exclusion from the definition of “investment company,” under the 1940 Act. To maintain this exemption from registration, SEVN will be required to ensure the composition of its portfolio complies with certain tests.
The ownership and operation of real estate properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Certain of our clients own real estate, and we may be responsible for compliance with some of these environmental protection laws.
While we incur significant expense to comply with the various regulations to which we and our clients are subject, we do not believe that existing statutes and regulations have had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Competition
The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our continued growth will depend upon our ability to manage or assist our clients in an effective manner and identify and execute on opportunities to expand our services to new clients and new sources of capital. 
Our existing clients face significant competition in their respective sectors or industries. The Managed Equity REITs compete on a national and regional basis with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, commercial and investment banking firms, private institutional funds, private equity funds and other investors. ALR competes with numerous other companies that provide senior living services, including home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Sonesta competes with other hotel operators and franchisors. TA competes on a national and local basis with companies operating travel centers, as well as retailers operating in the convenience store and retail gas station industries. SEVN competes on a national and regional basis with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including funds or investors that we or our affiliates may sponsor, advise or manage), banks, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions. 
We compete with other businesses in the real estate management and asset management businesses. Many of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we or our clients have. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, greater business scale and enhanced operating efficiencies. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory regimes or rules that may allow them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for themselves or their managed companies. In addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities. Our ability and the ability of our clients to continue to compete effectively will depend in large part upon the ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.
Corporate Sustainability
Over our more than three decades in business, we and our clients have been guided by Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, principles. Given the magnitude of our platform, we believe corporate sustainability must be a strategic focus alongside our focus on economic performance. Our sustainability practices — minimizing our impact on the environment, embracing the communities where we operate and attracting top professionals — are critical elements supporting our long-term success.
Environmental Focus
We recognize our responsibility to minimize the impact of our business on the environment. We seek to preserve natural resources and maximize efficiencies in order to reduce the impact the properties we manage have on the planet. Our 
environmental sustainability strategies and best practices help to mitigate our managed properties’ environmental footprint, optimize operational efficiency and enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace. Certifications help to benchmark performance and mitigate risk.
In 2022, we announced our “Zero Emissions Promise”. For all properties where we directly manage energy, we are committing to a goal of net zero by 2050 and a 50% reduction by 2030 from a 2019 baseline as it relates to scope 1 and 2 emissions. We anticipate emissions reductions will occur through a combination of strategic capital investments in energy efficiency by the Managed Equity REITs, stakeholder engagement to promote sustainable behavior, the deployment of on site solar and the purchase of energy from renewable sources. We believe our efforts toward these goals will add value to our clients’ properties, benefit tenants by lowering their operating costs, drive sustainable economic returns and address investor demands that our clients have viable strategies to mitigate climate risk. 
We drive value, manage risk and benchmark the performance of our managed properties by effectively capturing and managing data through real-time energy monitoring, or RTM. RTM facilitates advanced data analytics and access to detect faults and inefficiencies in equipment operations faster, meanwhile enhancing building system control in a cost-effective and scalable way. We launched this program in 2017 and it is now deployed in 63 managed properties, totaling approximately 50% of our managed annual electricity spend and through the end of 2021, has generated cumulative savings of $7.6 million. We continue to expand our RTM program and expect to cost effectively scale to cover up to 90% of our managed energy spend, resulting in operational savings and reduced equipment wear and tear, while maintaining high tenant comfort.
Our energy performance programs drive down energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions of our managed properties. Lower energy use and emissions reduce our managed properties' potential exposure to policies that call for a carbon tax or other emissions-based penalties. Our existing business practices align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, framework across both physical and transition risks and opportunities. 
As a result of our sustainability initiatives, we and our managed properties have historically received honors from The Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA, The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and the U.S. Green Building Council, or USGBC, amongst others. In 2021, the honors achieved by our Managed Equity REITs, included 60 BOMA 360 Certified Properties, 70 ENERGY STAR Certified Properties and 56 LEED Certified Properties. Finally, for the second year in a row, we received the 2022 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for outstanding efforts in Energy Management, and for the third year in a row, OPI received the 2022 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for outstanding efforts in Energy Management.
Human Capital Resources and Governance
We are led by an experienced management team with proven ability to manage and grow a resilient business. Moreover, significant insider ownership and the structure of the contracts with our clients provide a strong alignment of interests with our clients and with public shareholders. Our dedicated asset management and property management teams blend long-term strategic vision with careful execution of day-to-day operations to optimize efficiency and foster the sustainable growth of our Managed Equity REITs. Our property management organization is dedicated solely to the assets of our clients.
Employees and Equal Opportunity
As of September 30, 2022, RMR LLC employed approximately 600 real estate professionals, including 49% in our corporate office and 51% across our more than 30 offices throughout the United States. The average tenure of our employees was 6.5 years. Our employees are the foundation of our success and in many ways our most critical asset. We ensure employees receive competitive salaries and benefits and we aim to attract professionals who will uphold our values of social and environmental stewardship.
We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. Throughout our organization, including our Board, we are committed to racial equality and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring, retention and development programs. As of September 30, 2022, 35% and 28% of our approximately 600 employees were female and non-white, respectively. 
Board Diversity
As of September 30, 2022, our Board of Directors composition included 50% of members from underrepresented communities, including 33% female and 17% African American.
Employee Engagement, Education and Training
Our employee engagement initiatives align with our goal of being an employer of choice with a thriving workforce that encourages career enrichment and positions us for growth. Our programs are carefully designed for hiring, developing and retaining the best talent in the real estate industry. Our compensation is designed to motivate and retain employees and align their interests with those of our clients. We believe our compensation and benefits are best in class and are consistent with companies in the alternative asset management industry. We periodically review the effectiveness and competitiveness of our compensation program.
Our recruiting programs, on-boarding and retention programs and our development and on-going training programs currently include the following:
•LiveWell Employee Wellness Program: Our LiveWell program has steadily gained traction since it was launched in 2016 with the goal of providing resources and incentives to enhance employees’ physical, emotional and financial wellness. LiveWell includes a range of educational presentations, webinar series and wellness competitions.
•Managing with Impact: Since 2016, we hosted Managing with Impact workshops for managers throughout the company to expand their perspectives and increase their confidence as a new manager. Within their first year, managers complete the workshop and learn how to effectively delegate, solve problems and give meaningful performance feedback.
•Tuition Reimbursement Program: We offer tuition assistance up to $20,000 annually for work-related education from accredited colleges and universities in order to deepen employees’ skillsets and support personal enrichment.
•Analyst Conversion Program: Our Analyst Conversion Program is designed to attract new talent to our industry who otherwise may not have thought of real estate as a career path. The program echos our belief that a great first step toward a successful and lasting career in real estate is an analyst role and that we can increase the diversity in our talent pipeline with outreach to students who are members of groups traditionally underrepresented in real estate by gender, race and ethnicity. 
•Engineering Development Program: Given the increasing challenges within the real estate industry of attracting qualified engineers throughout the country, we made it a strategic focus to develop the next generation of qualified building engineers. Our Engineering Development Program standardizes the recruitment and development of engineering candidates to prepare them for open positions and to plan for future engineering needs. We recruit from various trade schools and job fairs to identify candidates for the two-year program with a curriculum that includes specific onboarding plans for training in electrical, HVAC, or plumbing trades and covers a range of essential engineering staff development topics.
•Next Generation Executive Program: Our commitment to racial equality and to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion at all levels of management motivated our decision to sponsor rising leaders in The Partnership, Inc.’s Next Generation Executive program. Admission to this program is highly competitive and limited to a select group of America’s most promising multi-cultural leaders. The program prepares future leaders to meet the unique challenges facing today’s senior executive. Areas of instruction include strategic innovation, organizational change, operating in a global market, team leadership and executive resiliency. 
•Industry Associations & Credentials: In order to further their professional development, many of our employees seek out credentials and association memberships, with any membership costs reimbursed by us. Examples of credentials and association memberships include: Building Owners and Managers Association Membership and Event Participation, Certified Property Manager, Certified Public Accountant and National Association of Industrial and Office Properties.
Cybersecurity
Our cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Officer, who works closely with our senior management to develop and advance our cybersecurity strategy and regularly reports to our Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters. Our program is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology five phase Cybersecurity Framework (Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover). We use industry leading security tools, regularly update our technology roadmaps, conduct simulated attacks, provide custom-built training for high-risk departments and mandate cybersecurity awareness and training a requirement for all employees. We have a detailed incident response plan in place in the event of a cybersecurity incident for contacting authorities and informing key stakeholders to ensure that any non-routine events are properly 
escalated. These plans are validated regularly to consider the types of decisions that would need to be made in the event of a cyber incident.
