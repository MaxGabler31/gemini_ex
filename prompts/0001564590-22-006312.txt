 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a global medical device company focused on delivering comprehensive, life-changing solutions that continue to set the standard for enduring patient outcomes in chronic pain treatment.  We have developed and commercialized the Senza® spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, an evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain, with the Senza® Omnia™ platform being our latest addition to the Senza family of products. Our proprietary, paresthesia-free 10 kHz Therapy, delivered by our Senza system, was demonstrated in our SENZA randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be superior to traditional SCS therapy, with 10 kHz Therapy being nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain when compared to traditional SCS therapy.  In addition to the original approval of our therapy in back and leg pain, we received approval of unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) in July 2021 and we received expanded labeling in non-surgical refractory back pain (NSRBP) in January 2022. Our SENZA-RCT study, along with our SENZA-PDN clinical study, SENZA-NSRBP clinical study and European studies, represents what we believe is the most robust body of clinical evidence for any SCS therapy. We believe the superiority of 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS therapies will allow us to capitalize on and expand the approximately $2.3 billion global SCS market by treating patients with debilitating chronic pain, including back and leg pain, NSRBP and PDN.
 We launched Senza commercially in the United States in May 2015, after receiving a label from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supporting the superiority of our 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS.  The Senza system has been commercially available in certain European markets since November 2010 and in Australia since August 2011. We have experienced significant revenue growth in the United States since commercial launch. Senza is currently reimbursed by all of the major insurance providers.  In early 2017, we commenced a controlled commercial launch of our family of surgical leads, marketed as the Surpass surgical lead, and in April 2020 received FDA approval for our reduced-size Surpass-C surgical lead.  In January 2018, we received FDA approval of our next generation Senza II SCS system.  In the fourth quarter of 2019, we received FDA approval of our next generation product platform, Senza Omnia, which we launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Additionally, we received approval to commercially launch Senza Omnia in Europe during the second quarter of 2020 and in Australia in July 2020.  In the first quarter of 2021, we received FDA approval for our first Senza Omnia upgrade, Omnia™ Powered by HFX Connect™, and our next generation trial stimulator. In July 2021, we received FDA approval of our 10 kHz Therapy for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with PDN. This approval is specific to our unique 10 kHz stimulation, and the Senza system was the first spinal cord stimulation system approved by the FDA with a specific indication to treat certain forms of pain associated with PDN.

The 2021 global market for SCS therapy was estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion.  Throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global SCS therapy market, which we estimate decreased by approximately 5% to 10%. We believe the superiority of 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS therapies will allow us to capitalize on the addressable trunk and limb chronic pain market, which is estimated to be approximately 14% penetrated in the United States, as well as expand the SCS market by treating other pain-related indications, such as PDN and NSRBP, among others. The United States represents approximately 80% of this global market due in part to governmental reimbursement restraints in international markets. We believe that due to factors such as an aging population, an increasing number of failed back surgeries and an increasing prevalence of diabetes, there is continuing opportunity for an SCS therapy that effectively treats back pain to increase the size of the existing SCS market over time.
 We believe that we will continue to both take share of and expand the SCS therapy market due to the unique benefits of 10 kHz Therapy, as well as the broad therapy versatility of our product platform.  10 kHz Therapy is paresthesia-free therapy and has demonstrated superior efficacy when compared to traditional SCS therapies. Traditional SCS therapy generates paresthesia, a sensation typically experienced as tingling, numbness and buzzing, which overlaps the pain area. Paresthesia is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable.  Compared to traditional SCS therapy, which typically operates at 50 Hz to 60 Hz, 10 kHz Therapy delivers spinal cord stimulation at a lower amplitude and a higher frequency waveform of 10,000 Hz. In addition, 10 kHz Therapy relies on consistent anatomical placement of the stimulation leads across patients, thus reducing procedure variability relative to traditional SCS therapy which requires individualized lead placement to properly map paresthesia coverage. We believe the ability of 10 kHz Therapy to deliver pain relief without paresthesia provides a substantial benefit over traditional SCS therapy to patients and physicians. However, despite its shortcomings traditional SCS therapy has a long track record of safety and, together with our product platform, can be made available to the subgroup of patients who do not receive adequate relief with 10 kHz Therapy alone.
 We believe the clinical results from our SENZA-RCT study, along with our European studies, position us with superior and compelling efficacy data. The following charts provide a comparison of 10 kHz Therapy in both pain reduction and responder rates against the other prospective Level 1 studies conducted.

 We believe we have built competitive advantages through our proprietary technology, clinical evidence base, strong track record of execution with approximately 80,000 patients implanted with Senza systems, extensive intellectual property and a proven management team with substantial medical device experience. With the well-demonstrated superior efficacy of our 10 kHz Therapy, we aim to continue to drive adoption and penetration in the U.S. market, which represents the largest opportunity in SCS, and expand patient access to 10 kHz Therapy by investing in the development of evidence for new indications such as chronic painful neuropathies (including PDN) and NSRBP. On this front, we conducted two randomized controlled trials, SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP, which are evaluating 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of PDN and NSRBP, respectively.
 The SENZA-PDN study is one of the largest randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in the field of spinal cord stimulation with 216 randomized patients. The study is evaluating paresthesia-free SCS 10 kHz Therapy among patients diagnosed with PDN and refractory to conventional medical management (CMM). Patients were randomized one to one to CMM alone or CMM with 10 kHz Therapy. We presented the complete six-month and preliminary twelve-month data in January 2021 at the North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) conference. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of safety and efficacy, specifically including greater than or equal to 50% pain relief and no worsening in neurological deficit versus the baseline. Eighty-six percent (86%) of patients in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm met the three-month endpoint, compared with 5% in the CMM only arm. At six months, patients in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm had a response rate of 85%, compared with 5% in the CMM only arm. In April 2021, the six-month data were published online in JAMA Neurology. In June 2021, the complete 12-month data, including the six-month crossover patient data, was presented at the American Diabetes Association 81st Scientific Sessions. These 12-month results, including six-month crossover data, demonstrated significantly improved and sustained outcomes with 10 kHz Therapy, including substantial, sustained pain relief and improved health-related quality of life measures. In November 2021, the 12-month results and six-month crossover data were published online in Diabetes Care. In July 2021, the FDA approved the Senza System for the treatment of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral and bilateral pain, associated with PDN. This approval is specific to Nevro’s unique 10 kHz stimulation, and the Senza system was the first spinal cord stimulation system approved by the FDA with a specific indication to treat PDN.  The study continues such that future follow-ups will be utilized for publication and expanded reimbursement payor coverage. In January 2022, we announced that UnitedHealthcare will provide coverage for our 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of PDN for dates of service on or after March 1, 2022.

At the 2021 NANS conference we also presented our three-month primary endpoint data of SENZA-NSRBP study, which includes patients with chronic back pain but, based on an assessment from a spine surgeon, are not surgical candidates. The study compares patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM to patients receiving CMM alone. At the three-month primary endpoint, patients who received 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM had a response rate of 80.9% compared to 1.3% for the CMM alone group. In January 2022, the FDA approved the Senza System as an aid in the management of NSRBP (intractable back pain without prior surgery and not a candidate for back surgery). We expect that the 12-month follow-up data will be utilized for publications and to seek expanded payor coverage for this patient cohort.  
 Additionally, at the 2022 NANS conference we presented the complete 18-month results, including the 12-month crossover patient data, for our SENZA-PDN study. Key findings at 18 months included significant and sustained outcomes with 10 kHz SCS. In addition, analysis of healthcare resource utilization through the first 12 months of the SENZA-PDN trial showed reduced spending associated with 10 kHz Therapy, particularly for hospitalizations. We also presented our 12-month results, including six-month crossover patient data, for our SENZA-NSRBP study. Key findings at 12 months showed profound improvements in pain relief, function, quality of life measures, awareness of positive change and reduction in daily opioid use in NSRBP patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy at 12-months post-implant. Results also included comparable improvements for patients that crossed over from CMM to 10 kHz after 6 months. In February 2022, the SENZA-NSRBP 12-month results were published online in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine. Patients in the SENZA-PDN and SENZA NSRBP studies will be followed for 24 months.
 Market Overview
 Existing Treatments for Chronic Pain and Limitations
 Chronic pain has been defined as pain that lasts longer than the time required for tissues to heal, which is often considered to be three months.  Patients who present with chronic pain are typically placed on a treatment progression plan. Initial medical management typically includes behavioral modification, exercise, physical therapy and over-the-counter analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. When early-stage medical management is not sufficient for the treatment of chronic leg and back pain, patients may progress to interventional techniques including steroid injections or nerve blocks. Patients who do not respond to these more conservative treatments are considered candidates for more advanced therapies.  These more advanced therapies include spine surgery, treatment with oral opioids and SCS.  Spine surgery, while a common invasive procedure, can result in complications such as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) a condition where pain persists despite the procedure, and spinal surgery often fails to treat certain types of chronic pain such as severe neuropathic back pain.  Oral opioids, while reducing the patient’s perception of pain, lack clinical evidence to support long-term usage and can cause multiple complications and side-effects including nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  Further, opioids present a high risk of addiction and abuse.    
Traditional Spinal Cord Stimulation and Limitations
 SCS is a type of neuromodulation technology that utilizes an implantable, pacemaker-like device to deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord to treat chronic pain.  Traditional SCS therapy is designed to induce paresthesia, a sensation typically experienced as tingling, numbness and buzzing, which overlaps the area of pain with the intent of masking pain perception. The electrical pulses are delivered by small electrodes on leads that are placed near the spinal cord and are connected to a battery-powered generator implanted under the skin. Traditional SCS therapy is currently indicated as a treatment for chronic pain of the trunk and limbs in patients who failed CMM. Traditional SCS therapy is considered to be a minimally invasive and reversible therapy that may provide greater long-term benefits over more invasive surgical approaches or opioids. The most common use for traditional SCS therapy is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS.
 Traditional SCS therapy generally consists of two phases, an evaluation period, also called the trial period, which typically lasts several days, followed by a permanent implant for those patients who experience a successful trial period. The trial period involves a percutaneously placed insulated wire, called a lead, which a physician implants near the spinal cord using a needle. During the trial period, a temporary external system is used by patients and physicians for evaluating whether traditional SCS therapy is effective. If the trial period is successful, a permanent system is implanted in the patient. The success criterion is typically an approximate 50% reduction in 
 4


pain during the evaluation period. For those patients that proceed to the permanent implant procedure, we believe that approximately 30% to 40% of U.S. procedures are completed using surgical leads and the remaining are completed using percutaneous leads.
 A key part of the permanent system is the implantable pulse generator (IPG) which is a miniaturized version of the external stimulator. The IPG should provide the patient with multiple years of use and can be either rechargeable or non-rechargeable (primary cell). Due to payor constraints in certain European countries, the transition from primary cell IPGs to rechargeable IPGs has been slow in those markets. In the United States and Australia, the majority of IPGs implanted are rechargeable.
 Traditional SCS products have required paresthesia to provide pain relief, and consequently, paresthesia coverage has been used as a surrogate metric for successful pain relief. Paresthesia, however, is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable and is sometimes made worse by a shocking or jolting sensation with changes in posture. Unpleasant sensations can be caused by lead movement closer to the spinal cord or away from it as the patient moves, resulting in variation in paresthesia intensity. Paresthesia is also a constant reminder of the patient’s chronic condition. These limitations of paresthesia-based therapy are particularly true for PDN patients, who are already suffering from paresthesia-like symptoms. Due to the distraction of paresthesia, patients with traditional SCS devices are instructed not to drive or operate machinery when the device is active. Medtronic plc (Medtronic) has released a survey showing that 71% of patients find paresthesia uncomfortable at times. As such, innovation in the SCS market has historically focused on technologies that optimize traditional SCS therapy’s ability to create more precise paresthesia fields. Even with successful paresthesia coverage, patients still may not receive pain relief or often lose pain relief after a period of time.
Traditional SCS procedures also require physicians to perform the complex and often time-consuming process of paresthesia mapping. This mapping process requires a patient to be sedated for the lead placement, then awakened and repeatedly questioned in order for the physician to assess paresthesia coverage over the patient’s area of pain and reposition and reprogram the leads to redirect the paresthesia. This process creates variability in the procedure and a complicated anesthesia management process, impacting the physician’s schedule and patient comfort. The primary objective of traditional SCS therapy is to create a stimulation program that covers the areas of pain without creating paresthesia beyond the pain areas, given that this can be uncomfortable and difficult to tolerate.
 Traditional SCS technology involves the delivery of low frequency electrical impulses, or waveforms, to the spinal cord.  Recent developments in traditional SCS have resulted in alternative waveforms, some of which are variations of low frequency waveforms, some at sub-threshold amplitudes aimed at reducing the reliance on paresthesia.  Abbott Laboratories has developed a SCS system that offers an alternate low frequency waveform called BurstDR.  Medtronic is promoting a programming approach called DTM™ (Differential Target Multiplexed) which involves frequencies up to 1,200 Hz. Additionally, Boston Scientific is now offering sub-threshold therapy at frequencies below 1.2 kHz.
 Our Solution for Chronic Pain
 10 kHz Therapy
 Our 10 kHz Therapy is designed to deliver innovative neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain based on what we believe to be the best clinical evidence available. By overcoming many of the limitations of traditional SCS therapy, our 10 kHz Therapy offers superior efficacy for patients and provides significant advantages to physicians and hospitals. We believe the advantages of our proprietary 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS include:

• | Demonstrated superior efficacy data for both leg and back pain: In our SENZA-RCT pivotal study, 10 kHz Therapy was demonstrated to provide significant and sustained back pain relief in addition to leg pain relief. 10 kHz Therapy was shown in both number of patients that respond and in treatment efficacy to be superior to traditional SCS therapy as it was nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain. Our SENZA-RCT study, along with the previously completed European studies, represent what we believe is the most robust body of clinical evidence for any SCS therapy. We believe that the superior efficacy results and robust data provided in our pivotal

clinical trials will drive increased adoption of our 10 kHz Therapy among patients, payors and providers and may enable us to gain significant market share in the approximately $2.3 billion global SCS back and leg pain market. In addition, we believe our efficacy data in back pain will allow us to expand the SCS market under current reimbursement regimes by meeting demand from back pain patients who are largely untreated by traditional SCS therapies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA-approved for use in PDN and NSRBP patients: In our SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP studies, 10 kHz Therapy provided significant and sustained pain relief to patients suffering from PDN and NSRBP compared to CMM. Based on this evidence, we received FDA approval for specific indications to treat PDN and NSRBP patients in July 2021 and January 2022, respectively. We believe that the results and robust data provided in our SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP clinical trials will support increased adoption of our 10 kHz Therapy among patients, payors and providers and may enable us to gain significant market share in the PDN and NSRBP markets. In addition, we believe our efficacy data in back pain will allow us to expand the SCS market under current reimbursement regimes by meeting demand from back pain patients who are largely untreated by traditional SCS therapies. For example, in January 2022, we announced that UnitedHealthcare will provide coverage for our 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of PDN for dates of service on or after March 1, 2022. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Paresthesia free pain relief for patients: 10 kHz Therapy offers the notable benefit to patients of achieving significant and sustained pain relief without paresthesia, thus enabling our patients to avoid the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia, and removing a major barrier for many patients who may otherwise benefit from SCS therapy. This is particularly true for PDN patients who are already suffering from uncomfortable paresthesia-like symptoms. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anatomical lead placement for physicians. Since 10 kHz Therapy relies on consistent anatomical lead placement, it removes the cumbersome process of paresthesia mapping that is required by traditional SCS therapy, reducing variability in the operating procedure and offering a significant benefit to both physicians and hospitals by reducing variability of procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to treat a broader group of chronic pain patients: Our 10 kHz Therapy is a platform technology that we believe can provide treatment benefits for a broader group of chronic pain indications. Based on analysis from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, as well as our SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP RCTs, we believe 10 kHz Therapy may be an attractive treatment option for patients. Due to the removal of paresthesia, we believe 10 kHz Therapy may also be an effective therapy for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain as it does not create the intense discomfort that traditional SCS generates for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain when leads are placed in the cervical spine. We are currently investigating the use of 10 kHz Therapy to address chronic pain conditions such as chronic upper limb and neck pain.

Our Growth Strategy
 By combining the brightest talent with the strongest foundation of clinical evidence, our mission is to deliver comprehensive, life-changing solutions that continue to set the standard for enduring patient outcomes in chronic pain treatment.
 To accomplish this objective we intend to:
  
• | Earn market share through leveraging the Senza Omnia platform: Senza Omnia offers the most versatile platform in SCS as it includes the broadest frequency range, the most waveform capabilities and the unique ability to offer 10 kHz Therapy. In 2022, we will continue to expand our commercialization of Omnia and our HFX Connect platform and continue to position Omnia as the most versatile product available in the market, and we believe that it will have broad appeal to clinicians offering SCS.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the existing SCS market by treating back pain and PDN: We believe we are expanding the existing SCS market by delivering a system that provides meaningful treatment for chronic back pain, including NSRBP, and PDN, which we believe represents a significant opportunity in the global SCS market. With traditional SCS therapy, patients who experience predominant back pain are often

associated with lower levels of treatment success. Consequently, patients with back pain are typically not recommended for treatment with traditional SCS therapy due to the difficulty of achieving and maintaining pain coverage. We are also currently running the SENZA-NSRBP study, which has been shown to demonstrate significant pain relief for patients suffering from back pain when that patient is not a candidate for spine surgery. In contrast to traditional SCS therapy, we believe 10 kHz Therapy is positioned to help continue expanding the existing SCS market by effectively treating back pain in addition to leg pain. With respect to PDN, our SENZA-PDN study demonstrated significantly improved and sustained outcomes with 10 kHz Therapy for patients suffering from PDN. This data was used to support our PDN label expansion and will be used to expand payor coverage for, and the broader adoption of, 10 kHz Therapy in treating PDN patients.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communicate the clinically demonstrated, superior efficacy of 10 kHz Therapy to patients, physicians and payors globally: Given our robust clinical evidence that demonstrates the superior efficacy of our 10 kHz Therapy, we believe we will be able to position our therapy with patients, providers and payors in a differentiated way. Given that our SENZA-RCT pivotal study has demonstrated superiority for both back and leg pain in a head-to-head comparison with traditional SCS, we are able to differentiate 10 kHz Therapy by communicating its superior clinical benefits and advantages to patients, physicians and payors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in research and development to drive innovation: We are extending our novel and proprietary technologies into a series of product enhancements with the goal of improving the treatment of chronic pain. We also expect to continue developing enhancements to Senza to further increase performance and introduce new benefits including next generation IPGs, enhanced software, updated accessories and enhanced MRI capabilities. We believe that further product enhancements if and when completed will drive continued adoption of our technology platform and further validate the advantages and benefits of our 10 kHz Therapy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale our business to achieve cost and production efficiencies: We plan to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will lower our per unit manufacturing cost. We expect to continue to scale our manufacturing operations as we expand Senza sales volumes in the United States. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, we made the strategic decision to vertically integrate the assembly of IPG’s, peripherals and various other manufacturing related activities to mitigate our reliance on third-party manufacturers and improve our long-term gross margins. We plan on conducting these manufacturing activities in a facility in Costa Rica. The integration process is expected to be completed in mid-2022. Even after this integration process is completed, we expect that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to provide key components to support the assembly process. We may incur significant capital expenditures and implementation costs to initiate the manufacturing operations in Costa Rica.

Growth Opportunities in Other Chronic Pain Indications
 We plan to use our platform technology to generate evidence on 10 kHz Therapy for use in other chronic pain indications and painful neuropathies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating evidence for 10 kHz Therapy in other indications or in receiving additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement coverage to promote Senza and 10 kHz Therapy for use in other indications. Below are two areas where results have been successful:
Non-Surgical Back Pain
 One of the most common uses for SCS is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS. The incidence of patients that will develop FBSS following lumbar spinal surgery is estimated to be within the range of 10% to 40%. However, in addition to having applicability for treating FBSS patients, there is a potential for SCS to provide benefit for patients suffering from chronic pain who are not surgical candidates.  10 kHz Therapy could provide an attractive treatment option for these patients, as a subset analysis of non-surgical patients from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, respectively, found a decrease in back pain VAS scores from 7.2 to 2.6 (12 months, n=12) and 8.1 to 3.4 (24 months, n=14), as well as a decrease in leg pain VAS scores from 7.2 to 2.8 (12 months, n=12) and 7.4 to 2.3 (24 months, n=11). More recent results in patients who were not candidates for major spine surgery and treated

with 10 kHz Therapy in a study led by Dr. Adnan Al-Kaisy demonstrated similar promising results. In this study, patients experienced reduced back pain VAS and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores from baseline of 87% and 63% respectively at 36 months (n=17). In addition to pain reduction and reduced disability, a reduction in opioid use was observed with 90% of the patients using opioids at the start of the study compared to 12% at the end of the study. The results of this study led to the initiation of the SENZA-NSRBP RCT, which compares 10 kHz Therapy delivered in conjunction with CMM to CMM alone in NSRBP patients. At the 2021 NANS conference, we presented our three-month primary endpoint data of SENZA-NSRBP study. The study compares patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM to patients receiving CMM alone, among those suffering from chronic back pain who are not surgical candidates based upon an assessment from a spine surgeon. At the three-month primary endpoint patients who received 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM had a response rate of 80.9% compared to 1.3% for the CMM alone group. In June 2021, we presented our six-month data for the SENZA-NSRBP study at the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. At the NANS conference in January 2022, we presented our 12-month data for the SENZA-NSRBP study at the 2022 NANS conference, which demonstrated profound improvements in pain relief, function, quality of life measures, awareness of positive change and reduction in daily opioid use in NSRBP patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy at 12-months post-implant.  Results also included comparable improvements for patients that crossed over from CMM to 10 kHz after 6 months.
 Painful Neuropathies
 The American Chronic Pain Association estimates that more than 15 million people in the United States and Europe have some degree of neuropathic pain. More than two out of every 100 people are estimated to have peripheral neuropathy, with the incidence rate increasing to eight in every 100 for people aged 55 or older. The diminished quality of life and increased disability associated with peripheral neuropathy results in significant workforce and healthcare costs. Various treatments currently exist, but have limited efficacy. As such, we have initiated an initial study to determine if 10 kHz Therapy could help this patient group. Results of a prospective, multicenter feasibility study treating chronic intractable pain of the limbs from peripheral polyneuropathy using 10 kHz Therapy demonstrated a decrease in mean VAS pain score from 7.5 at baseline (N=18) to 1.9 at three months post-implant (the primary endpoint), 2.8 at twelve months and 1.4 at twenty-four months.  Subject deemed responders was 78% at three months, 69% at twelve months and 88% at twenty-four months (presented at NANS in January 2019). The results from this study led to the initiation of the SENZA-PDN RCT.
 In 2020, we presented the preliminary outcome data from SENZA-PDN which demonstrated greater than or equal to 50% pain relief and no worsening in neurological deficit versus baseline was achieved, with 86% of patients in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm reaching the endpoint, compared with 5% in the CMM only arm at three months. At the 2021 NANS conference, we presented the six-month data, which showed that patients in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm had a response rate of 85%, compared with 5% in the CMM only arm. The response rate and level of pain relief was maintained through twelve months in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm. At the American Diabetes Association 81st Scientific Sessions in June 2021, we presented the complete 12-month data, including the six-month crossover data, which showed the response rate and level of pain relief was maintained in the 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM arm and in the crossover arm. The 12-month outcomes in our SENZA-PDN study were published in Diabetes Care in November 2021, which showed that 86% of participants in the 10 kHz SCS study arm reported pain relief >50%, while the average pain relief was 77.1% (% reduction of VAS from baseline). After six months with 10 kHz SCS therapy, 84% of participants in the crossover arm reported pain relief >50%, and average pain relief was 70.3% (% reduction of VAS from baseline). At the NANS conference in January 2022, we presented the 18-month data, which included significant and sustained outcomes with 10 kHz SCS. In addition, analysis of healthcare resource utilization through the first 12 months of the trial indicated reduced spending associated with 10 kHz SCS treatment, particularly for hospitalizations. We expect to publish our 24-month data as it becomes available.
Clinical Data
 Back Pain
 To support development of our proprietary 10 kHz Therapy, the technology was evaluated in preclinical studies and further studied in prospective clinical trials, some of which have been published. Key highlights of our SENZA-RCT pivotal study are as follows:
 8


 
• | Our SENZA-RCT study results demonstrated the superiority of 10 kHz Therapy to traditional SCS therapy on all primary and secondary endpoints through 24 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 10 kHz Therapy was nearly twice as successful in treating back pain as traditional SCS therapy, with 84.3% of patients receiving10 kHz Therapy reporting 50% or more pain relief at three months, as compared to 43.8% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for treating back pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 10 kHz Therapy was 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain as traditional SCS therapy, with 83.1% of patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy, as compared to 55.5% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy, reporting 50% or more pain relief at three months, results that were superior. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for treating leg pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 10 kHz Therapy provided a 69.2% reduction in back pain as measured by VAS, versus 44.2% for traditional SCS therapy, at three months, results that were superior. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for reducing back pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study. 10 kHz Therapy provided a 72.8% reduction in leg pain as measured by VAS, versus 51.5% for traditional SCS therapy, at three months, results that were superior. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for reducing leg pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study. Superiority of 10 kHz Therapy to traditional SCS therapy demonstrated for both back and leg pain at each designated study endpoint throughout 24 months. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy did not report paresthesia or uncomfortable stimulation at three months. In comparison, 46.5% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy reported uncomfortable stimulation at three months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Two-thirds of 10 kHz Therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for back pain at three months (which we define as achieving remitter status), which is nearly twice the number of traditional SCS therapy patients (35%) with a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5, results that were statistically superior. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for achieving remitter status for back pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Two-thirds of 10 kHz Therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for leg pain at three months, a much greater number than traditional SCS therapy patients (40%) with a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5, results that were statistically superior. The superiority of 10 kHz Therapy for achieving remitter status for leg pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety outcomes were consistent across the treatment groups, with the exception of uncomfortable paresthesia in traditional SCS patients, which was not in 10 kHz Therapy patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results from the clinical studies have been consistent across studies and across outcome measures. Our initial prospective multicenter European clinical study (the EU study) were consistent with our subsequent findings in our prospective, comparative, randomized, controlled U.S. pivotal study (SENZA-RCT study). In the two-year follow up of the EU study, average back pain VAS was reduced from 8.4 at baseline to 2.8 at 12 months to 3.3 at 24 months. Average leg pain was reduced from 5.4 VAS pain level at baseline to 2.0 at 12 months to 2.3 at 24 months. Additionally, for responder rates, 60% of the implanted patients had at least 50% back pain relief and 71% had at least 50% leg pain relief. Disability as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) improved by an average of 15 points at 24 months, a clinically and statistically significant improvement. The following table summarizes key outcomes for implanted subjects in our EU and SENZA-RCT studies.

 Our SENZA-RCT pivotal study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, conducted across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites, comparing the safety and effectiveness of Senza delivering 10 kHz Therapy, which we refer to as the test to Boston Scientific’s FDA-approved Precision Plus system, delivering traditional SCS therapy, which we refer to as the control. Each included patient was required to have a leg and back pain VAS score of at least 5. Among the 198 chronic pain patients who were randomized for treatments, 171 had a successful therapy evaluation phase, or trial phase, and were implanted with an SCS system. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial and met its primary and secondary endpoints. Statistical analysis also demonstrated the superior efficacy of 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS therapy for all primary and secondary endpoints. 
 The 12-month outcomes for 10 kHz Therapy in our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were published in Anesthesiology and are consistent with the outcomes from our European clinical study, the two year results of which have been published in the Pain Medicine journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. The 24-month SENZA-RCT results were presented in December 2015 at the annual meeting of the North American Neuromodulation Society, showing sustained superiority of 10 kHz Therapy compared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain over the 24-month follow-up period. The 24-month outcomes in our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were published in Neurosurgery.
 Patients with chronic pain are generally classified by physicians based on the location of their pain, for example whether their worst pain is predominant back, predominant leg, mixed back and leg, upper limb, neck or other. The adoption of SCS to date has been driven primarily by the treatment of patients whose worst pain is in their legs and for whom other treatment approaches have failed. We believe that broader utilization of traditional SCS therapy has been restrained by the lack of prospective randomized clinical evidence supporting SCS broadly and, in particular, demonstrating an ability to treat back pain.
 Safety Data (EU and RCT Studies)
 Safety results of our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were generally consistent between the test and control groups. Study-related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 4.0% of 10 kHz Therapy subjects (n=4) compared with 7.2% of traditional SCS therapy subjects (n=7; p = 0.37). In addition to the SAEs described above, there were two deaths, one of which was study-related and resulted from a myocardial infarction of a subject randomized to traditional SCS therapy that occurred during the implant procedure. The other death occurred outside the study period in the test group and resulted from a malignant hepatic neoplasm. The most common study-related AEs were implant site pain (in 11.9% of 10 kHz Therapy and 10.3% of traditional SCS therapy subjects) and uncomfortable paresthesia (in 11.3% of traditional SCS therapy subjects and in no 10 kHz Therapy subjects). Lead migration leading to revision occurred in 3.0% of 10 kHz Therapy and 5.2% of traditional SCS therapy participants. 
 10


Importantly, neurological assessment revealed no stimulation-related neurological deficits in either treatment group. Also, there were no stimulation-related SAEs in either arm.
 Safety results of our EU study demonstrated no evidence of neurologic deficit or dysfunction attributable to prolonged delivery of 10 kHz Therapy. Further, investigators reported that adverse events were similar in nature and frequency to those seen with traditional SCS therapy. The most common adverse events in both arms of the study were implant site pain, infection and lead migration.
 Painful Diabetic Neuropathy
 Our SENZA-PDN study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, comparing 10 kHz SCS plus CMM to CMM alone in 216 patients at 18 centers in the United States. The primary endpoint of the study is a composite endpoint that includes the difference in proportion of treatment responders without deterioration of neurological deficits at three-month follow-up. Subjects could opt to crossover to the other treatment arm if they had insufficient pain relief (<50%), were dissatisfied with treatment, and were appropriate to proceed as determined by their physician.  At six months, 82% of patients who met criteria in the CMM arm elected to crossover, vs none in the 10 kHz SCS + CMM treatment arm. Study participants continue to be followed out to 24 months. 
 The 12-month outcomes for 10 kHz Therapy in our SENZA-PDN study were presented at the American Diabetes Association 81st Scientific Sessions in June 2021 and were published in Diabetes Care in November 2021. The SENZA-PDN RCT 12-month data demonstrated the following benefits of 10 kHz SCS: 
  
• | At 12 months, 86% of participants in the 10 kHz SCS study arm reported pain relief >50%, while the average pain relief was 77.1% (% reduction of VAS from baseline).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After six months with 10 kHz SCS therapy, 84% of participants in the crossover arm reported pain relief >50%, and average pain relief was 70.3% (% reduction of VAS from baseline).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 5 of 154 permanent SCS devices were explanted for a 3.2% explant rate (all explants were due to infection).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At 12 months, 68% of the 10 kHz SCS treatment group had observed improvement upon an investigator-assessed neurological examination, which included testing lower limb motor strength, sensory function, and reflexes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After six months with 10 kHz SCS therapy, 62% of the crossover arm had observed improvement upon an investigator-assessed neurological examination, which included testing lower limb motor strength, sensory function, and reflexes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Data from the SENZA-PDN trial supported the FDA’s July 2021 approval of the Senza System for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with PDN.

Non-Surgical Refractory Back Pain
 Our SENZA-NSRBP study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, comparing 10 kHz SCS plus CMM to CMM alone in 159 randomized patients at 15 study centers.  The primary endpoint of the study is responder rate (≥50% pain relief) at three months. Subjects could opt to crossover to the other treatment arm if they had insufficient pain relief (<50%), were dissatisfied with treatment, and were appropriate to proceed as determined by their physician. At six months, 75% of patients who met criteria in the CMM arm elected to crossover and were implanted; no one in the 10 kHz SCS + CMM treatment arm elected to stop 10 kHz Therapy. Study participants continue to be followed out to 24 months. 
 
The 12-month outcomes for 10 kHz Therapy in our SENZA-NSRBP study were presented at the NANS meeting in January 2022 and were published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine in February 2022. The SENZA-NSRBP RCT 12-month data demonstrated the following benefits of 10 kHz SCS:
  
• | At 12 months, 78.2% of participants in the 10 kHz SCS study arm reported pain relief >50%, while the average pain relief was 72.1% (% reduction of VAS from baseline).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After 6 months with 10 kHz Therapy, 78.2% of participants in the crossover arm reported pain relief >50%, and average pain relief was 70.4% (% reduction of VAS from baseline).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3 of 145 permanent SCS devices were explanted for a 2.1% explant rate (all explants were due to wound complications).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no explants due to loss of efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------


• | The average score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline indicated severe disability, while post-implant the scores improved to borderline minimum/moderate disability (an average 20 point reduction).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Three-quarters of the subjects receiving 10 kHz Therapy had clinically significant improvement (≥10 points) in ODI or were in the minimally disabled category at the end of 12 months of follow-up for the 10 kHz SCS group (6 months post-implant for the crossover group).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Despite no specified opioid weaning protocol, usage in this study declined by 46% on average in subjects receiving treatment, while increasing among subjects receiving CMM alone. The changes were significant even with the high variation in prescribed opioid dose across subjects in both groups.

 Data from the SENZA-NSRBP trial supported the company FDA January 2022 approval of the 10 kHz Senza System for the management of for NSRBP (back pain without prior surgery and not a candidate for back surgery).  Nevro is the only SCS company with a product having an approved indication for treating patients with NSRBP.
 Our HFX Solution
 HFX is a comprehensive solution that includes a Senza spinal cord stimulation system and support services for treatment of chronic pain and is approved to deliver a versatile range of waveforms. HFX delivers traditional low frequency therapies and our proprietary 10 kHz Therapy, and is the only SCS solution with the ability to pair high and low frequencies and multiple waveforms and mechanisms of action.
 The HFX solution includes all necessary components that enable physicians to place leads and conduct SCS trials, as well as permanent implants of the Omnia implantable pulse generator, and enable patients to interact with the system. Below is a depiction of our Omnia powered by HFX Connect IPG, the patient remote control and the wireless trialing system.
 
12



Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG): The rechargeable IPG delivers electrical pulses to the lead. It can connect to one or two leads, and up to 16 electrodes. The programming of this device is customizable for each patient and their appropriate pain area. The IPG is placed surgically under the skin, usually above the buttock or the abdomen. The Senza, Senza II and Omnia SCS IPGs are all approved with a 10-year battery life.
Surpass Surgical Leads: The Surpass and Surpass-C surgical leads are Nevro’s surgical lead options when appropriately needed. Our Surpass surgical leads received initial approval from the FDA in late 2016 with a further approval received in January 2017.  In April of 2017, the surgical lead was certified by our notified body (the British Standards Institution, or BSI), allowing us to apply the CE mark and to market our products in the European Union and received TGA approval in Australia.  We believe the Surpass leads give us access to up to approximately 30% to 40% of the U.S. SCS market that we previously did not address without a surgical lead. In 2020, we also launched our Surpass-C surgical lead, designed for patients who have a compact epidural space that cannot be addressed by other lead options. Our Surpass-C surgical lead is currently approved in the United States, Europe and Australia, where it will be available starting in late first quarter of 2022. 
 
13



Percutaneous Leads: Nevro also offers multiple lengths of percutaneous leads to accommodate patient anatomy.  These are available in the United States, Europe and Australia.
 
Trial Stimulator: The trial stimulator is an external device that is worn around the waist during an evaluation period (SCS trial) that typically lasts five to seven days. Nevro’s wireless trial stimulator uniquely offers both low and high frequencies and is available in the United States and Europe. It will be available in Australia pending regulatory approval.
 Programmer: The clinician laptop programmer contains proprietary software that allows for customized patient therapy programming of the IPG. It can non-invasively interrogate the IPG and transmit programming information as well as download diagnostic information. With the Nevro HFX solution, the patient’s IPG can be wireless updated with new programming without the need for additional surgery.
 Patient Remote Control: The patient remote control is a handheld device that allows patients to turn their stimulation on and off and change programs uploaded to their IPG.
 Charger: The charger recharges the IPG from outside the body. The charger is mobile and can be worn around the waist using a belt, so that the patient can perform various tasks while charging. The Nevro IPG has patented rapid recharge coil technology designed for convenient charging that delivers the fastest charge rates in the market. 
 Surgical Tools: Surgical tools include percutaneous insertion needles used to introduce the lead into the epidural space, a variety of stylets that give physicians the ability to steer and deliver the lead to the desired location, anchors to secure the leads and tunneling tools that provide access from the lead insertion site to the location of the IPG.
 In addition to the Nevro HFX product portfolio, Nevro also has both in-person and remote teams of representatives to support procedures and patient therapy. The remote HFX Coach™ team consists of patient support representatives who are trained to help patients change their therapy program remotely, according to a proprietary algorithm, to optimize programming for patient pain relief when they need it, without the need for an in-clinic visit.

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States, the primary purchasers of Senza are hospitals, outpatient surgery centers and physician offices. These purchasers bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans for the healthcare services associated with the SCS procedure. Government agencies and private payors determine whether to provide coverage for specific procedures. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.
 Generally, reimbursement for services performed are reported using billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (AMA) known as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule that is set annually by CMS.  Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs) used to determine the Medicare payment amount for services provided.
 In the United States, although CMS initially approved a transitional pass-through payment for High-Frequency Stimulation under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, healthcare providers who purchase our products currently do not receive separate reimbursement for our products and rely on third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to reimburse for the procedure under their payment methodologies, many of which are bundled fee schedules and include both the devise, supplies and facility overhead. Accordingly, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the surgery is performed. Medicare reimbursement rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., hospital outpatient department or outpatient surgery centers) and other factors.
 Although private payors’ coverage policies and reimbursement rates can differ significantly from payor to payor, the Medicare program is frequently used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare items and services, including SCS procedures. For example, certain regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans previously denied coverage for Senza on the basis that high-frequency neuromodulation is investigational and/or experimental. We continue to engage in efforts to educate such payors on the advantages of 10 kHz Therapy. However, there can be no assurances that we are successful in overturning any negative coverage decisions by private health insurance plans, should they arise. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained. In January 2022, we announced that UnitedHealthcare will provide coverage for our 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of PDN for dates of service on or after March 1, 2022.
 Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval beyond what we have today in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.
 Product Development and Research Development
 Our objective is to continue to improve patient outcomes and further expand patient access to 10 kHz Therapy through enhancements to Senza and the development of new indications. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $59.0 million, $45.6 million and $47.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 Since the launch of the initial Senza system, we have introduced a number of product enhancements. These include a short-tip version of the lead, new lengths of the lead, a surgically placed paddle lead, an active anchor with 
 15


improved performance over silicon anchors, a second generation active anchor with smaller volume, lead adaptors that allow use of competitor leads already implanted in patients, upgraded clinician programmer software, a number of next generation IPGs which are conditionally safe for MRI scans anywhere on the body, our Surpass surgical lead to complement our percutaneous lead, and our recent Omnia upgrade powered by HFX Connect, and a new trial stimulator. We also expect to continue developing enhancements to further increase performance and introduce new benefits including next generation IPGs and enhanced MRI capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or in receiving any required regulatory approvals.
 Sales and Marketing
 United States
 In 2021, we maintained the overall size of our U.S. sales organization, which represents our main channel to communicate with our customers. Our sales representatives target physician specialties involved in SCS treatment decisions, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. In addition, our commercial team plans to continue to create demand for Senza among additional stakeholders involved in the SCS treatment decision, including third-party payors, hospitals administrators and SCS patients and their families. We have also developed a clinical support team and HFX coaches in order to provide ongoing support to physicians and patients for the use of Senza.
 Additionally, in 2021, we established a new sales organization to support the launch of our PDN indication in the U.S. This sales organization targets physician specialties involved in PDN treatment decisions, including primary care physicians, endocrinologists, internal medicine and podiatrists, to create awareness of 10 kHz Therapy to treat PDN patients.
 International
 We sell Senza in Europe and Australia through a combination of our direct sales force and a network of sales agents and independent distributors. We began our direct sales operations in the United Kingdom in late 2010 and to date have expanded our direct sales operations to Austria, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. We utilize sales agents and independent distributors to sell in other countries.
Competition
 We compete in the SCS market for chronic pain. We also compete with spine surgeries, in particular re-operations. Currently, our major competitors are Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories, who have obtained regulatory approval for SCS systems. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are:

• | Sales force experience and access
--+----------------------------------


• | Published clinical efficacy data
--+---------------------------------


• | Product support and service
--+----------------------------


• | Effective marketing and education

Many of our competitors have greater capital resources, more established operations, longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. They also have wider product offerings within neuromodulation and in other product categories, providing them with greater supplier power and with more opportunities to interact with stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions. We also face competition to recruit and retain qualified sales and other personnel.
 We expect our competitors to periodically launch new products and release additional clinical evidence. For example, Abbott Laboratories received FDA approval for a SCS system that offers an alternate low frequency waveform called BurstDR, and in February 2016, the company gained approval for a neuromodulation system that stimulates the dorsal root ganglion for treatment of focal pain and complex regional pain syndrome, in each case, using pivotal clinical studies for each therapy to support the FDA approval process.  Medtronic gained FDA approval for the Intellis™ spinal cord stimulator in September of 2017, and in January of 2020 announced the purchase a company called Stimgenics, which includes a proprietary SCS waveform called Differential Target Multiplexed (DTM). Medtronic also gained FDA approval for its Intellis™ and Vanta™ spinal cord stimulators for the treatment of chronic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in January 2022.  Additionally, Boston Scientific broadly launched the WaveWriter™ SCS system in January 2019, the WaveWriter™ Alpha SCS system and its Fast Acting Sub-perception Therapy (FAST™) in January 2021, and also promotes the results of a sub-threshold therapy through their WHISPER, COMBO and HALO studies. Additionally, there are a number of emerging competitors at various stages of development. Stimwave has developed and is commercializing a minimally invasive stimulation system that employs an externally worn power source and radio frequency transmitter.  Nalu Medical, Inc. (Nalu Medical) and Neuspera Medical Inc. (Neuspera Medical) are also pursuing a similar approach as well.  Saluda is developing and testing a low frequency closed loop system for the treatment of chronic pain that currently has approval in Europe and Australia.
 Intellectual Property
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 257 issued patents globally, of which 155 were issued U.S. utility patents, two were issued U.S. design patents, 53 were issued Australian utility patents, five were Australian design patent, 19 were issued European utility patents, seven were European design patents, four were issued Japanese patents, two were issued Korean utility patents, one was an issued Korean design patent, two were issued Chinese utility patents, three were issued Chinese design patents, two were Canadian utility patents and one was a United Kingdom utility patent. In general, our patents cover SCS systems that are configured to generate non-paresthesia producing therapy signals at frequencies between 1,500 Hz to 100,000 Hz, as well as additional aspects, algorithms and components of the Senza system and 10 kHz Therapy. As of December 31, 2021, we held 123 patent applications pending globally, of which 58 were patent applications pending in the United States, and 65 were PCT patent applications or patent applications pending across Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, China, Costa Rica, India and Korea. We also have an exclusive license from the Mayo Foundation to two U.S. issued patents and one U.S. pending patent application. All of our current issued patents are projected to expire between 2028 and 2041.
 As of December 31, 2021, our trademark portfolio contained 109 trademark registrations, of which there were nine U.S. trademark registrations, 16 Australian trademark registrations, 13 European trademark registrations, 24 U.K. trademark registration, eight Japanese trademark registrations, six Norwegian trademark registration, eight Swiss trademark registration, 14 Kuwaiti registration, three Canadian registrations and eight Turkish trademark registrations.  Our trademark portfolio also contained 112 pending applications, of which 12 are pending U.S. trademark applications and 100 are pending foreign trademark applications.

The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional or priority patent application. We cannot assure that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged to infringe.
 There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using Senza, any of which could severely harm our business.
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment.
 The Mayo License
 In October 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the Mayo License) with the Venturi Group, LLC (VGL) and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (the Mayo Foundation) pursuant to which the Mayo Foundation committed to confer with us exclusively to develop products for the treatment of autonomic and peripheral nervous system disorders, including pain, using devices to modulate nerve signaling, and non-exclusively to test such devices, and VGL committed to confer with us non-exclusively to develop such devices, and exclusively to test such devices. These commitments to confer expired in January 2011. We were granted a worldwide license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products incorporating or using the know-how developed for and provided to us by the Mayo Foundation or VGL in the course of such development and testing activities, exclusively for product development and non-exclusively for product testing. Pursuant to the Mayo License, we are obligated to pay royalties in the low single digits to the Mayo Foundation, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products, subject to reduction under certain circumstances. We are also required under the Mayo License to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize licensed products.
 The Mayo License terminates upon the expiration of (1) the last to expire of the licensed patents or (2) our obligation to pay royalties, whichever is later. As of Jan. 1, 2021, we do not have an existing obligation to pay royalties under the Mayo License. Such obligations may be subject to change if: (1) additional relevant patents issue that are subject to the Mayo License; or (2) we launch an SCS product, which is subject to the Mayo License, in another country.   We, the Mayo Foundation or VGL may terminate the Mayo License upon 60 days’ notice of a party’s material breach if such breach remains uncured after such 60-day period. 
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We rely upon third-party suppliers for the manufacture and assembly of our Senza SCS system and its components, some of which are single- or sole-sources of the relevant product component. We are in the process of identifying and qualifying second-source alternatives for several of our critical single-source suppliers. Thus, in the event that our relationship with any of our single- or sole-source suppliers terminates in the future, we feel confident that sufficient production capacity is available to build products at the standards we require. We believe that existing third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs.
 18


In the third quarter of 2020, we made the strategic decision to vertically integrate the assembly of IPG’s, peripherals and various other manufacturing related activities to mitigate our reliance on third-party manufacturers and improve our long-term gross margins.  We plan on conducting these manufacturing activities in a facility in Costa Rica. The integration process is expected to be completed in the mid-2022.  Even after this integration process is completed, we expect that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to provide key components to support the assembly process.  We may incur significant capital expenditures and implementation costs to initiate the manufacturing operations in Costa Rica.
 We believe our manufacturing operations, and those of our suppliers, are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. For products distributed in the United States, we are required to manufacture any products that we sell in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: Quality Management System ISO13485, Full Quality Assurance Certification for the design and manufacture of spinal cord stimulator systems and accessories and a Design Examination certificate for Implantable Pulse Generator and Accessories. We are required to demonstrate continuing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain these certifications and will continue to be periodically inspected by international regulatory authorities for certification purposes.
 Our material supply contracts are as follows:
 Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing
 In July 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing, Inc. (Pro-Tech) pursuant to which Pro-Tech, as a single-source supplier, conducts the inspection, labeling, packaging and sterilization of our Senza SCS system. In June 2020, we entered into an amendment to extend the terms of our original agreement and to provide for automatic one-year annual renewals, unless if a notice of termination is provided 30 days prior to the expiration of the then current term.
 Stellar (Cirtec) Technologies
 On July 1, 2009, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Stellar Technologies, Inc. (Stellar) our single-source supplier of our percutaneous leads, percutaneous lead extenders and surgical leads for our neurological stimulator products. On June 30, 2014, the agreement’s initial term expired, and the agreement automatically renewed for the first time. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a first amendment to the manufacturing agreement with Stellar, which provides for an additional five-year term commencing from the date of the amendment, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of intent not to renew at least 30 days before the expiration of the then-current term. On January 28, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to this agreement, which provides for the purchase of certain supplementary products pursuant to the agreement. We refer to the manufacturing agreement as amended by the first and second amendments as the Stellar Agreement.
 Either we or Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement at will upon one year’s advance notice, subject to certain remaining rights and payment obligations, including an early cancellation fee payable by us to Stellar. We may also terminate the Stellar Agreement if Stellar is unable to perform its obligations under the Stellar Agreement for 60 days or more, or if Stellar is unwilling to perform its obligations under the Stellar Agreement and does not cure such defect within 60 days of our providing written notice to cure. Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement in the event of our default of certain specified obligations, including our payment obligations, material violation of a warranty or law, our material breach, and our insolvency.
 19


CCC Supply Agreement
 We rely upon C.C.C. Del Uruguay S.A. (CCC), a subsidiary of Integer Holdings Corporation (formerly Greatbatch Ltd.), as one of our manufacturers of our IPGs. We currently have a multi-year supply agreement with CCC with regard to the manufacture and supply of our IPGs.  The agreement was effective as of November 11, 2016. On April 30, 2019, we entered into the first amendment to the supply agreement with CCC, incorporating new product models and adjusting unit cost.
 The agreement continues for ten years unless terminated earlier. The term of the agreement automatically renews for additional two-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the initial term or the applicable renewal period. In the event of a change of control of CCC, the agreement may be terminated by us upon three years’ written notice to CCC, provided that such notice period shall be one year in the event CCC is acquired by certain competitors to us. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon the other party’s cessation of business or other termination of its business operations, uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, CCC shall, subject to certain exceptions and unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, fulfill all purchase orders placed by us and accepted by CCC prior to the effective date of termination.
 The agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, ordering and payment and shipping terms, customary provisions with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created during the term of the agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
 EaglePicher Medical Power Supply Agreement
 In April 2009, we entered into a product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher Medical Power LLC (EaglePicher) our single-source supplier of the batteries and related products for our IPG. Pursuant to the agreement, EaglePicher must use its best efforts to supply these batteries and related products in sufficient quantity to meet our demand. The agreement also provides that, upon our written request, EaglePicher will conduct development of a modified version of these products to our specifications, if we so desire. The initial term of our supply agreement with EaglePicher expired in November 2010, and the term had been automatically renewing for successive one-year periods.
 In March 2015, we entered into a first amendment to the product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher. The amendment committed us to specified minimum purchase amounts until the end of 2017 and adjusts EaglePicher’s production capacity and facilities commitments under the agreement as well as certain pricing, purchasing, delivery and cancellation terms. The amendment also extends the term of the agreement to December 31, 2019, with an additional two-year automatic renewal period unless we or EaglePicher provide notice of intent not to renew prior to the commencement of such renewal term. The amendment further provides us with the right to place a final order with EaglePicher following termination of the agreement, as amended and modifies certain warranty and assignment terms and the parties’ limitations of liability.
 In November 2015, we entered into a second amendment to the agreement, which increased our pre-existing specified minimum purchase amounts and increased EaglePicher’s production capacity commitments under the agreement, as well as specifying certain purchasing and purchase order protocols.  The amendment obligated EaglePicher to establish and qualify an additional battery production operation and commits us to fund approximately $1.0 million of such production operation paid in three milestone installments.  The amendment also establishes EaglePicher as our exclusive battery supplier through the initial five-year term of the agreement, ending December 31, 2019.
 In September 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the agreement, which changed the renewal term of the agreement such that the agreement will automatically renew for a period of one year unless we or EaglePicher provides notice of intent to terminate the agreement six months prior to the commencement of such renewal term.  In 2019, we notified EaglePicher of our intent to not renew the agreement upon its expiration on December 31, 2019.  We are currently in discussions with EaglePicher on a revised agreement.
 20


Vention (Nordson) Supply Agreement
 In December 2015, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Vention Medical Design and Development, Inc. (Vention) pursuant to which Vention agreed to manufacture and supply our IPGs. We are obligated to purchase from Vention specified minimum purchase quantities of IPGs for the duration of the Vention agreement.
 The agreement continues for five years unless terminated earlier. The term of the agreement automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the applicable renewal period. The agreement may be terminated by us for any reason upon 180 days’ written notice to Vention. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, Vention shall, upon our request, manufacture an additional 24 months of continuous supply of IPGs based on the preceding forecast average or such other amount as agreed upon by the parties.
 In September 2017, we entered into a first amendment to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Vention, which changed the unit costs of the products supplied by Vention.  In April 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, which acknowledged that Vention changed its name to Nordson MEDICAL Design and Development, Inc (Nordson) and which changed the unit cost of the products supplied by Nordson.  In August 2021, we terminated the agreement with Vention with an effective date of December 31, 2021, as we continue to receive IPGs from one of our alternative suppliers and as we transition IPG manufacturing to our Costa Rica manufacturing facility.
 Other Suppliers
 We also have other suppliers, including some sole-source suppliers, for certain of our components, with whom we do not have agreements.
 Product Liability and Insurance
 The manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a risk of serious injury or death. We carry insurance policies which we believe to be customary for similar companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to cover all or substantially all losses that we experience.
 We endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes, but our coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances.
 Government Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and its implementing regulations, guidance, and standards. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 21


Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
 Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. A legally marketed device is defined by statute to mean a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements in the form of a premarket approval (PMA).
 A Class III device includes devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to a device that has a new intended use or utilizes advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general and special controls. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process.
 PMA Approval
 The Senza SCS system is a Class III device subject to review and approval through the PMA pathway. PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device and proposed labeling. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees.
 The FDA has 45 days from its receipt of a PMA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has 180 days to review a PMA application that has been filed by the FDA, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant and/or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 22


If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval order or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data is then submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.  In May 2015, we received approval for our PMA application for the Senza SCS system.
 Approval by the FDA of new PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. Certain other changes to an approved device also require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data.
 Clinical Studies
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. In the United States, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require compliance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations. For a device that presents a “significant risk” to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial, as well as obtain approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution where the study will be conducted. If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE approval from FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required, though the sponsor must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as protection of human subjects and informed consent. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 If an IDE application is approved by the FDA, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Submission of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will approve the IDE and permit the conduct of clinical trials and, even if the IDE is approved, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to 
 23


FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 Continuing Regulation
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; the reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk of health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur. Manufacturers are also required to register and list their devices with the FDA, based on which the FDA will conduct inspections to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters; fines; injunctions; consent decrees; civil penalties; repairs, replacements or refunds; recalls, corrections or seizures of products; total or partial suspension of production; the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 International
 Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. In addition, the FDA must be notified of, or approve the export to certain countries of devices that require a PMA, and not yet approved in the United States.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
 The European Union (EU) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. 
 Until May 25, 2021, medical devices and implantable active medical devices were respectively regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the EU Medical Devices Directive) and Council Directive 90/385/EEC (the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, or the EU AIMD) (together the Medical Devices Directives), which have been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the EU Medical Devices Regulation). Our current certificates have been granted under the EU AIMD whose regime is described below. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire.
 Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive
 Under the EU AIMD, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU AIMD, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or 
 24


the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
 To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I EU AIMD, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and that any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical investigations conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. With respect to active implantable medical devices or Class III devices, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from equivalent devices can be justified. The conduct of clinical investigations in the EU is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the EU member states in which the investigation takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent ethics committee.
 A conformity assessment procedure with the essential requirements generally requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. The assessment of the conformity of Senza has been certified by our notified body (the British Standards Institution, or BSI).
 Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
 Medical Devices Regulation
 The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directives, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
 The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. The Regulation among other things:
 25


 
• | strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directives) and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directives prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below.
 The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (UDI) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (UDI-DI) specific to a device, and a production identifier (UDI-PI) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
 All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directives continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health or  a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical 
 26


device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
 The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
 Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Brexit
 Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their United Kingdom (UK) Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the UK. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. By July 1, 2023, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
 An MHRA public consultation was opened until end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU AIMD and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as  medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The 
 27


consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime.
 In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, applicable anti-kickback, false claims, physician sunshine and data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act: The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the civil False Claims Act in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Penalties for a federal civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and criminal liability. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or 
 28


attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 EU Data Protection Laws: We are subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time. 
 For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became applicable on May 25, 2018, implementing more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals over their personal data and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to evolving EU and EEA laws on data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EU and EEA to other jurisdictions, for example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. The GDPR also provides that EU and EEA member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase, and harm our business and financial condition.
 Following Brexit, we have to comply with the GDPR and the UK GDPR, with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million/ £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision, and remains under review by the Commission during this period. In September 2021, the UK government launched a consultation on its proposals for wide-ranging reform of UK data protection laws following Brexit. There is a risk that any material changes which are made to the UK data protection regime could result in the European Commission reviewing the UK adequacy decision, and the UK losing its adequacy decision if the European Commission deems the UK to no longer provide adequate protection for personal data.
 In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. In the EU, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. The current EU laws that cover the use of cookies and similar technology and marketing online or by electronic means are under reform. A draft of the new ePrivacy Regulation is currently going through the European legislative process.  Unlike the current ePrivacy Directive, the ePrivacy Regulation will be directly implemented into the laws of each of the EU member 
 29


states, without the need for further enactment. When implemented, it is expected to alter rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising and to impose stricter requirements on companies using these tools.  The current provisions of the draft ePrivacy Regulation also extend the strict opt-in marketing rules to business-to-business communications, and significantly increase penalties. While the text of the draft ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, a recent European court decision and regulators’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. If regulators start to enforce the strict approach in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities.
 Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities, fines and penalties (for example, of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) under the GDPR and draft ePrivacy Regulation, and £17.5 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover for breaches of the UK legislation), litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, and to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Analogous State and Foreign Law Equivalents:  We may be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
 Healthcare Reform: In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was signed into law, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and 
 30


significantly impact the medical device industry. The ACA impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (MACRA), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.
 Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminates or reduces reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would affect our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 The UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering or promising bribes (which includes anything of value) to any person, including private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the UK, as we do, may be held liable not only for bribes given, offered, promised, requested or accepted to any person, including private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company, but also for failing to prevent the bribe in the first place. Liability for the offence of failing to prevent bribery is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. Furthermore, under the UK Bribery Act there is no exception for facilitation payments.
