ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Corporate Structure
 
Stem Holdings, Inc. was organized on June 7, 2016 as a Nevada corporation under Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Company’s principal office is located at 20283 State Rd 7, Boca Raton, FL 33498. The Company has one subsidiary, Patch International, Inc., which is wholly-owned by the Company. Patch International, Inc. has no business operations at this time.
 
Overview of the Business
 
The Company was formed to purchase, lease and improve certain real estate properties (the “Properties”), initially in the State of Oregon, which are or will be utilized as either state-licensed cannabis selling retail establishments or state-licensed cannabis growing facilities. The Company operates as a real estate holding company, with a direct focus on providing properties advantageous to growers and sellers in the regulated cannabis industry, and does not intend to initially engage in any direct operations with respect to its properties other than activities related to the leasing of properties, funding of capital improvements and administration of its leases and provision of financing to certain lessees. As such, its revenues will only comprise passive rental and interest income and its operating expenses will be limited to the general and administrative expense associated with such activity. 
 
The initial business of the Company was detailed in a multiparty agreement dated as of August 4, 2016, as revised on October 24, 2016 (“Multiparty Agreement”), by and among the Company and the following entities, which are affiliates of the founders of the Company: Oregon Acquisitions, JV LLC, Gated Oregon Holdings LLC, Kind Care Holdings, LLC, and Never Again Real Estate, LLC. The Multiparty Agreement detailed the following:
 

● | the relationships between the various founders of the Company and their respective affiliated entities, as well as the initial share ownership in the Company; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | certain proposed real estate transactions to be undertaken by the Company together with the business terms and structures related to these transactions; 
● | the rental terms and lessees for the properties identified by the parties; 
● | the terms of a right of first refusal with respect to the acquisition of additional properties; 
● | certain terms related to additional investment in the Company by the founders and the terms and conditions thereof; and 
● | the terms and conditions of the potential acquisition of the operating companies and three other currently operating companies by the Company under specified circumstances. 

 
The Multiparty Agreement contemplates that the initial Properties owned by the Company and identified in the Multiparty Agreement (and as further described below) will be leased by the Company to subsidiaries of OpCo Holdings, Inc. (“OpCo”). Opco is a company formed in 2016 by the Company’s founders and their affiliates for the purpose of operating multiple cannabis-related businesses initially in the State of Oregon, and the Company’s founders and their affiliated entities directly and indirectly collectively own approximately 24.06% of the outstanding stock of Opco.
 
The following is an overview of acquisitions completed by the Company:

In September 2016, the Company entered into a 10-year lease with respect to certain property located in Springfield, OR (the “42nd Street Property”) with the landlord that commenced in November 2016. The lease requires the Company to pay a base rental fee of $7,033 plus an additional estimated $315 per month in real estate taxes in which the base rental fee escalates each year by approximately 2%. All taxes (including reconciling real estate taxes), maintenance and utilities are included at the end of each year as a one-time payment. In addition, the Company also remitted $14,000 for a security deposit to the landlord. The Company has subleased this space effective July 1, 2017. 
 
On November 1, 2016, the Company acquired certain property located in Eugene, OR (the “Willamette Property”) for a total cash purchase price plus closing costs of approximately $918,000.
 
On February 6, 2017, the Company acquired certain real property located at 7827 SE Powell Blvd, Portland, OR 97206 (the “Powell Property”) for a total purchase price plus closing costs of approximately $656,498. As part of the consideration for closing on the property, the Company issued a short term note payable to the seller in the Amount of approximately $304,000. 
 
The note is non-interest bearing requires four monthly payments of $75,000 plus a final payment for the remaining amount due immediately thereafter plus fees. Due to the short-term nature of the note, the Company has not imputed any interest as it would be immaterial to the results for the period. The Company and note holder have come to an agreement subsequent to September 30, 2017 to reduce by $75,000 the balance due under the note, due to the Seller breaching certain sections of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November 15, 2016. As of September 30, 2017, the balance owed on the note was approximately $4,000.
 
On April 15, 2017, the Company entered into a “Contract for Sale” for a Farm Property in Mulino OR (the “Mulino Property”), pursuant to which the seller will sell the premises to the Company upon the completion of the Company’s due diligence investigations and completion of the closing conditions precedent to each party’s obligations under the Contract for Sale. The purchase price is $1,700,000 which will be reduced by a rental credit of approximately $135,000, which is equivalent to nine months’ rent at $15,000 a month. In addition, the Seller has granted the Company a credit to be reflected upon closing in the amount $9,500 for improvements made by the Company to the property. The Company expects that the closing of the property purchase will take place in January 2018. In connection with the purchase of the property, the Company will make a cash payment in the amount of $362,254 and will issue a promissory note in the amount of $1,200,000 with a maturity of January 2020. The Company will pay monthly installments of principal and interest (at a rate of 2% per annum) in the amount of $13,500, commencing in July 2018 through the maturity date (January 2020), at which time the entire unpaid principal balance and any remaining accrued interest shall be due and payable in full. In April 2017, in order for the Company to make use of the premises pending closing of the purchase of the property, the Company agreed to lease the premises from the seller for a term commencing April 5, 2017 and expiring on the earlier of: (i) the termination of the Contract for Sale by either party thereto in accordance with its terms; and (ii) October 5, 2017. The lease requires the Company to pay a base rental fee of $15,000 for the first nine months with no lease deposit required. All taxes accruing during the lease term (including real estate taxes and personal property taxes) are the responsibility of the Company. In October 2017, both parties agreed to extend the lease through January 2018.
 
Leasing of Properties
 
Willamette Property. In July 2017, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with a marijuana dispensary, as lessee, to move into the Company’s Willamette Property. The lease agreement is for a base term of ten years and a monthly rent obligation of $13,800, subject to annual increases of 3% per year, plus an amount for additional rent based on final buildout costs incurred by the Company. The lease is a double net lease with maintenance and real property taxes to be paid by the lessee and insurance costs paid by the Company. Rent commenced in August 2017 and the lease is in good standing as of the date of this Report. Upon the expiration of the term of ten years, the lessee has the option to renew the lease agreement for one five-year term, on the same terms as provided in the lease agreement.
 
42nd Street Property. In July 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the 42nd Street Property.

Rent will begin to accrue on the date plant growing commences on the property and rental payments will begin at the end of their cannabis growing season by the end of April 2018 and we therefore expect cash payments under the lease to commence in May 2018. The Company expects to treat such period as a deferred rental period for accounting purposes. At the time rental payments begin, the total of base rent and additional rent will not be less than $3.00 per foot. The lease is in good standing as at the date of this Report.

Rent will begin to accrue on the date plant growing commences on the property and rental payments will begin at the end of their cannabis growing season by the end of April 2018 and we therefore expect cash payments under the leases to commence in May 2018. The Company expects to treat such period as deferred rent for accounting purposes. At the time rental payments begin, the total of base rent and additional rent will not be less than $1.00 per foot for light assisted greenhouse and $.25 per usable square foot for un-light assisted greenhouse or outdoor grow space. Upon the expiration of the term of ten years, the lessee has the option to renew the lease agreement for five-year term, on the same terms as provided in the lease agreement.

Rent will begin to accrue July 2017 through January 2018 and rental payments will begin February 2018, or when the dispensary begins business.

Significant Events and Milestones Under Multiparty Agreement
 
Per the terms of the Multiparty Agreement, once the Company has invested an aggregate of $10 million in real estate properties (“Milestone 1”), the Company will be obligated to purchase two additional specified properties from parties to the Multiparty Agreement for aggregate consideration of $1,000,000 within ninety (90) days of achieving Milestone 1.
 
A right of first refusal granted to the Company to acquire each new parcel of real property identified by various parties to the Multiparty Agreement as suitable for production or retail of cannabis in the State of Oregon. This right of first refusal shall remain in effect so long as the Company has invested at least an aggregate of $8 million in real properties by January 30, 2019 and has invested at least an aggregate of $13 million in real properties by January 30, 2019.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the achievement of the aforementioned milestones with respect to the continuation of the right of first refusal will be excused if aggregate rental income from all Company-owned properties does not meet the following criteria:
 

(i) First Quarter Achievement Threshold (“FQAT”) 
------------------------------------------------------
 | ● | $1.2 million (annualized) during any calendar quarter, commencing on or after October 1, 2017;

(iii) Third Quarter Achievement Threshold (“TQAT”) 
 | ● | $5 million (annualized) during any calendar quarter, commencing on or after June 1, 2019; 
 | ● | Right of first refusal may be terminated within 12 months following the last day of the quarter in which the TQAT is met; and 
 | ● | Stem may revive the right of first refusal by investing an aggregate of $13 million into additional real properties by the last day of the 12-month period. 

 
Each of the properties owned or leased by the Company will be leased to subsidiaries of Opco Holdings. The Company will not initially be directly involved in the operation of these properties or in the growing or sale of cannabis.
 
Each of the subsidiaries of Opco Holdings is obligated to purchase Preferred Shares under certain specified terms and conditions:
 
Obligation to Purchase Preferred Shares
 
After the Company invests an aggregate of $13 million in real properties, but before the Company is legally able to engage in the operating of the properties, all subsidiaries of Opco Holdings are required by the Multiparty Agreement to allocate an amount equal to at least 50% of its post-tax, net operating income to purchase Preferred Shares on the following terms:

(a) | Redeemable 20 years after issuance; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Annual dividend of 3%; 
(c) | Convertible into Common Shares at the higher of: 
 | (i) | $10 per Common Share (adjusted for share exchange, reclassification, combination, dividend, split, or similar event); or 
 | (ii) | Average closing price of Common Shares for the 20 trading days prior to conversion date; and 
(d) | Such other preferences, rights, privileges, and limitations upon which the parties may mutually agree. 

 
Company purchase of Opco businesses
 
As long as the Company has fully satisfied all of its obligations and milestones pursuant to the Multiparty Agreement, the Company will have the obligation to acquire the business operations of Opco Holdings and its subsidiaries, and Oregon Acquisitions, Gated Oregon and Kind Care shall each have the obligation to sell such operations, within a reasonable time after the Company receives a legal opinion that the operation of the Opco marijuana businesses in the State of Oregon by Stem will not violate any federal or state laws. However, the Company has no reason to believe that a change in federal law is forthcoming or likely either in the near term or long term, and accordingly there is no assurance that such a purchase will occur.
 
Upon the acquisition of Opco’s business operations (if it occurs), all Preferred Shares issued to Opco shall be converted into Common Shares.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company’s business plan involves the potential deployment of approximately $13,000,000 in capital to purchase, lease and build-out turnkey marijuana facilities over three phases:

-


● | Phase 1: $3,000,000 to acquire and improve one dispensary, one indoor growing facility and one outdoor growing facility; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: $5,000,000 to acquire and improve one dispensary, two indoor growing facilities and one outdoor growing facility; 
● | Phase 3: $5,000,000 to acquire and improve one dispensary, two indoor growing facilities and one outdoor growing facility. 

 
The timing of this growth strategy will be based on the availability of funding and appropriate facilities to the Company. 
 
Principal Products and Markets
 
The Company’s principal operations relate to the leasing of properties, funding of capital, tenant improvements and administration of its leases and provision of financing to certain lessees. As such, its revenues will only comprise passive rental and interest income and its operating expenses will be limited to the general and administrative expense associated with such activity. The Company’s principal market is in the State of Oregon.
 
In July 2017, the Company commenced rental operations through real estate leases with entities that engage in the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis. As at September 30, 2017, the Company recorded approximately $326,000 in rental income for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
 
Production and Sales
 
The Company’s business requires that it possess or be in a position to access specialized knowledge and expertise regarding the state-licensed cannabis industry and those persons and entities who are involved in the industry. The Company believes that its management has such specialized expertise and experience, and the Company retains legal counsel that has recognized expertise in the industry. The Company does not believe that any aspect of its business is either: (i) cyclical or seasonal; or (ii) dependent on any particular franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name. The Company has not identified any specific environmental protection issues which will affect its business. The Company does not own identifiable intangible properties.
 
The Company is dependent on the financial solvency of its lessees and revenues could be adversely affected in a material way should any lessee not be able to maintain lease payments on a regular or consistent manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company believes that no property is so identified with a particular tenant that the Company could not identify and obtain a successor lessee in the event of any default by a tenant in the payment of rent. Given that the Company has not achieved a critical mass of properties, the default by any single tenant will have a material impact on the Company’s finances for an indeterminate period of time.
 
The Company does not believe that its operations are dependent on any factors within the general economy. However, any material changes in either U.S. federal law enforcement priorities or the law of the State of Oregon affecting the cultivation and sale of cannabis could have a material impact on the Company’s business, particularly since the growth, marketing, sale, and use of marijuana is illegal under federal law.
