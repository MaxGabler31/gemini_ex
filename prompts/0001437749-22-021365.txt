ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We, Quantum Energy Inc., are a Nevada corporation. We were originally incorporated as Boomers Cultural Development, Inc. (“Boomers”) on February 5, 2004, in the State of Nevada to be a service-oriented firm that would integrate the cultural interests of baby boomers with destination learning, by packaging onsite personal growth, education, and entertainment seminars with a variety of vacation destinations. On May 18, 2006, our name was changed to Quantum Energy, Inc. and our business focus was changed to concentrate on the energy industry and, in particular, refining, as well as the oil and gas portions of the energy industry. We currently have two 100% owned subsidiaries: Dominion Energy Processing Group, Inc. (“DEPG”), a Canadian Federal business corporation, which is our 100% owned Canadian subsidiary and FTPM Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation.

During the period from October 2017 to April 2019, among other things: we reviewed all of the outstanding agreements and transactions that we had entered into between August 2013 and November 2017 and we began to renegotiate, rescind or settle all of those agreements that had proven not to be in our best interest or in the best interest of our stockholders. In this regard, the shares of our common stock that had been issued in connection with such cancelled transactions were returned to us and shares of our Series B Preferred Stock that had been issued were returned and cancelled.
 
From December 2016 to about September 2020, we have pursued energy and refining opportunities, including alternative energy opportunities, as well as, the substantial financing needed by such energy opportunities as follows:
 
On April 15, 2018, we entered into a (conditional) binding letter of intent (the “IEC LOI”) with Inductance Energy Corporation Energy Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (“IEC”), which purports to have developed an alternative source of energy through the invention and development of magnetic “earth engines”. Pursuant to the IEC LOI , if all of the conditions contained in the IEC LOI are satisfied, (a) we would merge with a newly formed subsidiary of IEC with us being the surviving company, (b) we would issue to IEC such number of new shares of our Common Stock as shall represent 60% of our then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (c) IEC would provide to us, as the surviving company, up to $50,000,000(USD). The LOI ultimately expired without being implemented.
 
On April 2, 2019, we and our wholly owned subsidiary FTPM Resources, Inc. entered into non-binding Letter of Intent with Easy Energy systems Inc. (“EESI”) to form a joint venture the purpose of developing and marketing of clear glucose using EESI’s patented Modular Energy Production System technology (“MEPS®”). EESI’s Modular Energy Production Systems are small-scale modular biorefineries for the production of alternative liquid biofuels and other products from various feedstocks. MEPS® modules are fully automated, self-contained shipping container sized modules (the “Modules”) that contain a specific scientific process to process energy based on the particular targeted Feedstock. The Modules are factory-built and can be connected together in a matter of weeks to convert different forms of Feedstock into different forms of renewable energy and other high value products. The Modules can be shipped to remote villages and cities all over the world. That joint venture was to have been owned 33% by FTPM and 67% by EESI.
 
On June 28, 2019, we and EESI modified that proposed joint venture transaction and we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (the June 28, 2019 Binding Letter of Intent”) with EESI to form a joint venture (hereinafter referred to as “JV-1”) for the purpose of creating and funding multiple operating joint venture limited liability companies (each an “Operating JV”) each of which to be focused on a different vertical market feedstock utilizing the MEPS® technology to create energy. Each Operating JV is expected to be assigned exclusive distribution rights based on a territory and/or specified Feedstock, and each of which will be financed by the funding source of that Operating JV. Each Operating JV would be owned 50% by that funding source for the particular LLC and the remaining 50% by JV-1 (which will be split equally between us and EESI). That joint venture was ultimately terminated.
 
At the beginning of March 2020, we again enter discussions with Inductance Energy Corporation (“IEC”), as we were in April 2018. In this particular instance IEC was offering to bring to the table several significant investors interested in funding the Company through its regulatory cleanup. It was suggested that MP Special Purpose Corporation (“MP”), would be interested in signing a joint commitment letter so long as necessary shares were set aside in return for the significant effort that would be expended by both IEC and MP. On March 22, 2020 IEC began due diligence on the Company, with the permission of its Board of Directors, for the purpose of forming future business alliances including joint ventures, joint stock ownership, and capital raises. Due diligence on the Company was completed by IEC at the beginning of July of 2020. The results of such within forwarded to the various investors of MP. The Company and MP signed an Agreement and Plan of Asset Acquisition (“Plan”), on September 22, 2020 to allow the Company to enter into the refining of rare earth materials from various locations under the control of MP and IEC. The Plan was assignable to IEC, or other investors or investor group’s willing to fund the growth of the Company through a private investment into a public entity, otherwise known as a PIPE (“PIPE”).
 
Since early November 2020 the Company expanded its board to include directors William Hinz, Douglas Bean, and Anthony Ker. The company also recruited and contractually hired Harry Ewert as its new CEO. Mr. Ewert also joined the Board of Directors. The Company recruited and contractually hired William Westbrook as its CFO. Both Mr. Ewert and Mr. Westbrook began their contracts in early December with the Company.
 
After the expanded Board of Directors was seated, and at the start of Mr. Ewert and Mr. Westbrook’s contracts, the Company moved quickly to establish a strategic and tactical operating plan to enter the rare earth refining market. The company established a technical committee which helped build out a plan to develop a private investment path. In addition, the Company moved to conduct due diligence on the former Willwood Air Force Base located in Wyoming at which IEC had been granted a special use permit for the processing of rare earth materials, and the manufacturer of permanent magnets.
 
In January 2021 the Company settled on a $50 million private placement offering, that would include a proposed $15 municipal bond package as offered by the town of Byron Wyoming, only 9 miles from the 164 acre former Willwood Air Force Base. The company decided to include the $15 million bond package in its $50 million private placement offering, therefore needing to raise $35 million of new equity in the company. The Board of Directors voted previously to authorize the development of a private placement memorandum to be filed with the SEC so that the private placement offering could be discussed with current and potential individual investors, and investor groups in the United States and Canada.
 
The Company has experienced strong demand for participation in its private placement offering, and expanded its staff to include two additional finance positions, as well as plans to expand its internal accounting staff.

The Company has developed a strategic plan for hiring experienced professionals, including those that are credentialed and hold licenses in engineering, mining, and chemical engineering. This increased depth of personnel surrounding the granting of a license from IEC to the Company for the exclusive production of magnetic materials and assemblies. The decision on the granting of a license from IEC, on an exclusive basis, would be made by IEC only if the Company could show substantial progress in its capital raise efforts, and its ability to attract technical expertise.
 
As the Company experienced success in both its private placement efforts, as well as its exploratory efforts for sources of rare earths, the Company put forth expanded efforts to execute on its new strategic and tactical business plans in order to begin refining rare earth materials for the recovery of oxides and metals that are required for the production of various magnetic products, and assemblies.
 
The Company developed a straightforward strategic and tactical business plan that could be executed around 3 basic business segments; Mining, Minerals and Magnets. These 3 segments would become a highly focused center of work for the Company.
 
Various work at the Company by its technical committee had shown that the Company could enter the mining industry through a very unique path of recovering rare earth and ferrite magnet material from discarded appliances, computers, and other sources in the United States and Canada. Secondly, the Company would concentrate its efforts on the recovery of rare earth materials from other waste streams including fly ash and fly bottom waste streams from combusted coal burning power plants in the United States and Canada. It is estimated that over 1 billion tons of this material exists and dumpsites, and far greater than 4 billion pounds of this material is still generated from coal burning power plants and other sources in the United States alone each and every year.
 
Successful recovery from these waste streams are described as follows;
 

1. | Rare Earth and Ferrite (Iron) Magnets that are used in a wide variety of appliances and electronics that can be recovered, that were disposed of in the United States and Canada. These appliances include; televisions, computers, refrigerators, microwaves, dishwashers, as well as motor vehicles, and used electrical motors. Quantum is working with a wide variety of returned merchandise centers, landfills, and other recycling businesses to secure these resources. These types of magnet resources can be mechanically gathered, and reprocessed for use by IEC, and other customers.

2. | Fly ash and fly bottom waste streams. Fly ash and fly bottom waste streams are the remaining byproduct of coal combustion. There are billions of pounds of fly ash and fly bottom waste that are produced each and every year in the United States and Canada, as well as foreign countries. Currently Quantum has two large developmental projects to recover and test both fly ash and fly bottom waste streams for their rare earth content. These two sources currently produce just over 1.4 billion pounds of fly ash and fly bottom waste on an annual basis. Well-known resource testing shows that most fly ash, as well as fly bottom waste streams on average contain about 1.85% rare earth material. 
3. | Coal and other mining resources. Currently in the United States and Canada, the mining of coal to be consumed in coal power plants is in rapid decline. Coal producing states such as Wyoming, Kentucky, and West Virginia must move from a coal-based economy or continue to face declining royalty revenues from these natural resources. Rare earth minerals could be one answer to this problem. It is well known from a wide variety of Department of Energy studies that coal, and coal byproducts contain high concentrations of rare earth materials. Quantum is in negotiations with several operating and now defunct coal bearing properties in order to secure rights to process and refine rare earth materials.

 


Refining rare earth materials from used magnets, fly ash and fly bottom waste streams, and coal reserves range in difficulty from very simple, to a chemical process commonly called ion exchange, and precipitation. Both practices have been in place for many decades, worldwide, and are still used to this day for most mining recovery operations in addition to these 2 common practices, membrane recovery, similar to reverse osmosis, is finding favor by a wide variety of professionals, in many geographic areas. W
 
The reprocessing of waste stream magnets whether ferrite (iron), or rare earth, such as neodymium iron boron magnets, is a relatively simple process where the waste material is pulverized to approximately 80 mesh (177 microns), then re-blended into the required recipe, and then reformed in, to produce a value-added product. a choice of several different processes.
 
Refining rare earth materials from fly ash and fly bottom waste, is similar to recovering rare earth materials from coal ash, or coal seam material. It is a well-known ion exchange and precipitation process. A chemical process in which a wide variety of diluent made from acids and caustics are used to precipitate individual rare earth elements from waste streams. This can also include the recovery of rare earth materials from various membranes, such as membranes similarly used in reverse osmosis processes used to clean water. Membranes are size to very specific microns, and once the process is complete, the desired elements are recovered from recycling the membrane material.
 
The reclaiming of base materials that are suitable to be processed to extract rare Earth materials is heavily tied to wastewater treatment. While large quantities of water are not required to reclaim rare earth containing material, water can be used along with magnetic separation in the early stages of recovery. Wastewater resulting from these early-stage processes needs to be treated and then reintroduced into the process, thereby limiting the loss of treatment water to evaporation. Wastewater treatment also allows waste sludge to be minimalized, and dried for disposal in a common landfill. Typically these dried sludges are less than 1% of the overall material processed. The Company is currently seeking to purchase several different proven waste water technologies and systems to market alongside its rare earth recovery systems.
