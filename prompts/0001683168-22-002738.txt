ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on April 14, 2014, as Illumination America, Inc.
 
Effective August 17, 2017, we acquired Grom Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement entered into on May 15, 2017. In connection with the Share Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,464,184 shares of its common stock to the Grom Holdings stockholders, pro rata to their respective ownership percentage of Grom Holdings. Each share of Grom Holdings was exchanged for 0.13 shares of our common stock. As a result, the stockholders of Grom Holdings owned approximately 92% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock at such time.
 
In connection with the Share Exchange, we changed our name from Illumination America, Inc. to “Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.”
 
We are a media, technology and entertainment company that focuses on delivering content to children under the age of 13 years in a safe secure platform that is compliant with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and can be monitored by parents or guardians. We conduct our business through the following five operating subsidiaries:

Grom Social, Inc.
 
Grom Social is a media, technology and entertainment company for kids focused on producing original content on Grom Social’s website, www.gromsocial.com and mobile application. Visitors to the Grom Social website may log on via mobile phone, desktop computer or tablet and chat with friends, view original content or play games created by us.
 
The name “Grom” is derived from Australian surfing slang and is defined by us to mean “a promising young individual who is quick to learn.” Grom Social was conceptualized and developed in 2012 by Zachary Marks, who was 12 years old at the time. He is the son of our Chief Executive Officer, Darren Marks.
 
Our business model is based upon providing children under the age of 13 with a safe environment on the Internet while promoting “fun,” “wholesomeness” and “family values.” We require that each child receive parental approval prior to gaining full access to the Grom Social platform. In certain jurisdictions and circumstances, we allow parents, teachers and guardians (collectively, “Guardians”) to sign up groups of children at one time. If a Guardian’s approval is not granted, a child’s account will not be opened. If a child does not follow the proper registration process, he or she will be considered a user with limited access. Limited access does not allow the child to chat with other children or visit certain sections of the platform.
 
Based on data provided by Google Data Analytics and Joomla Management Systems, in February 2021, our platforms have generated approximately 25.0 million users in over 200 countries and territories since our inception in 2012. We define a "user" as any child under the age of 13 who registers for a Grom Social account through the website or downloads the Grom Social app from a mobile app store, and any parent who registers for a Grom Social account and any student or faculty that uses our NetSpective web filtering platform.
 
Monthly active users (“MAUs”) is a usage metric which reveals the total number of users who visit our platforms within a 30-day period. As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 1.8 million MAUs on all platforms.
 
Based upon statistics provided by the Joomla Management System and Google Analytics, the average online duration of users logged onto our Grom Social platforms is approximately 51 minutes.
 
Grom Social App
 
In May 2019, our Grom Social mobile application (or “app”) for Apple Store and Google Play Store was approved within each platform’s family designated section. The Apple Store markets iPhone operating system (“IOS”) applications for download solely on Apple devices. The Google Play Store markets applications for download on Android devices.
 
We communicate with the children through messaging on a child’s profile page and through seventeen unique Grom characters that engage with children with many additional “fun” and safety features.

We believe our mobile app is the only children’s app where kids can:
 

· | Record videos of themselves to post in a social environment and use enhanced facial features, masks, and filters while doing so; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | upload videos that are COPPA compliant; 
· | View 1,450 hours of exclusive Grom TV content - video on demand platform for kids which is free and curated to provide only safe and educational content for children. 


· | Message with cartoon characters and cast members; 
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Communicate with users and parents regardless of where they may be navigating on the Grom Social website. This feature eliminates the need to leave the section of the site in which they are engaged. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have established the following safeguards and procedures which we believe will ensure our Grom Social platform is a safe place for children:
 

· | Account Approval: We have account creation procedures to help ensure that only children under the age of 13 can create an account. If a child submits a request to open an account on the Grom Social website or mobile apps, we send an email notification to his or her parents that their child has applied to create a Grom Social account. If the child’s parents approve the account, by using one of three methods that are approved by COPPA guidelines, the account is opened. If a parent’s approval is not given, the account will not be opened, and the child will have limited access to the Grom Social website. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Parental Involvement: By requiring parental approval for a child to open an account and to interact with other users on Grom Social, we hope to ensure that parents are aware of and involved with their child’s activity on the website. Further, we believe that parental involvement provides us with the ability to market products and services to parents. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Digital Citizenship Educational Content – Children are encouraged to take and pass an internet safety course and receive a Digital Citizen License from us in order to gain increased access to the features provided on the Grom Social platforms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited Data Collection of Child and Parent – No digital profiles will be built for children or parents. The information we collect is for analytical data only and is limited to parent email, birthdate, gender and country locations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Content Monitoring: We have software that monitors posts for inappropriate content using standard “keyword” filter technology. If a post contains inappropriate content, it will not appear on the platform and the poster will be sent a warning about offensive content. We believe that through monitoring content we can promote social responsibility and digital citizenship. We view this as a learning opportunity but will ban users if the problem persists. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anti-bullying: We have software that monitors the Grom Social website for bullying. In addition to monitoring the interaction between children on the website, we also post messages that strongly emphasize anti-bullying and actively promotes social responsibility and digital citizenship. Additionally, our platform has received the “KidSafe Seal of Approval” from KidSafe, an independent safety certification service and seal-of-approval program designed exclusively for children-friendly websites and technologies, including online game sites, educational services, virtual worlds, social networks, mobile apps, tablet devices, connected toys, and other similar online and interactive services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Use of “Gromatars”: Children on Grom Social create animated pictures, which we call “Gromatars,” to represent themselves on Grom Social without providing a real-life photograph. Gromatars are viewed as profile pictures on a user’s home wall, and when a user leaves a comment or “like” on a public page. Kids can build and customize their Gromatars by selecting over 200 different options such as the eyes, nose, hair, teeth, ears, skin color, hairstyle, and color. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These safeguards and procedures are a critical component of our business model. We believe that children are increasingly accessing the Internet at younger ages and therefore the need for safe, age-appropriate platforms for younger children to browse and interact with other children is increasing. According to recent statistics on GuardChild.com:
 

· | 81% of children from 9 to 17 years-old say they visited a social networking site in the past three months; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 41% of teens had a negative experience as a result of using social networking; and 


· | 88% of teens have seen someone be mean or cruel to another person on a social networking site. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 70% of children have accidentally encountered online pornography 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 90% of children from 8 to 16 years-old have seen online pornography 
· | 65% of children from 8 to 14 years-old have been involved in a cyber-bullying incident 

GuardChild.com is a website providing software and applications to promote safe Internet browsing for children and statistics collected from various resources including: Social Media and Young Adults, Pew Internet & American Life Project, Global Insights Into Family Life Online, Norton/Symantec & StrategyOne, Teen/Mom Internet Safety Survey, McAfee & Harris Interactive, Pew Research Center, FOSI, Cable in the Classroom 2011, Journal of Adolescent Health, National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA)-McAfee Online Safety Study, American Osteopathic Association, Social Media and Young Adults, Pew Internet, American Life Project and Grunwald Associates.
 
Content
 
In addition to providing a safe, fun, social media platform for children to interact with their peers, we create our own content consisting of animated characters, interactive chats, videos, blogs, and games geared to provide wholesome family entertainment. We create our own short-form content consisting of animated characters, interactive chats, videos, blogs, games and two live action shows released weekly. We currently have over 1,450 hours of live action shows in our content library. This exclusive content is only available on our platforms.
 
Our Grom Social app features include direct messaging, video recordings with face filters and effects, notifications, profiles with custom colors, Gromatar cartoon avatars, over 1,450 hours of Grom TV exclusive videos on demand, a search and discovery section, hashtags and mentions in post descriptions, liking, commenting, sharing of content, including the ability to share photos, videos and doodle drawings in direct messages. With this feature set and the safety permissions in place, the app will provide children their own social platform similar to the popular adult platforms, but in a safe controlled environment. Kids can upload videos along with a variety of different music, similar to TikTok. Users also have a vast variety of face filters similar to Snapchat and Instagram. The Company produces up to two new short-form videos each week similar to Netflix to maintain user engagement.

According to a survey released on October 29, 2019 from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that tracks young people’s tech habits reports, twice as many young people watch videos every day as they did four years ago, and the average time spent watching videos, mostly on You Tube has roughly doubled, to an hour a day. The survey also found that on average, American children from 8 to 12-years old spend 4 hours and 44 minutes on screen media each day and teens average 7 hours and 22 minutes, not including time spent using screens for school or homework. Based upon statistics provided by the Joomla Management System, the average online duration of users logged onto our Grom Social platform was approximately 51 minutes as of February 2, 2021. We believe the longer duration time is a result of our ability to better engage users through our original content.
 
Strategy
 

· | Advertising Revenue. We believe that our app will enable us to begin to generate advertising revenue and the growth of our database may attract high-profile companies to advertise on our Grom Social website and mobile platforms, although there can be no assurances that advertisers will use our website or mobile app. We intend to emphasize to advertisers what we believe is the unique level of parental involvement on Grom Social. We currently have an agreement with SuperAwesome one of the largest COPPA complaint kid advertising companies in the world. A number of SuperAwesome’s clients, including Disney, Nickelodeon, and McDonalds are currently advertising on our platform. In addition, we currently have several advertisers that are advertising on our newly created Grom Safe Ads advertising program that allows pre-approved (by Grom) COPPA complaint ads to run on our platforms 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Subscription Based Premium Content. Although we currently do not charge a subscription fee, we hope to be able to move to a subscription-based model in the future. We are continuously making software upgrades which will hope will enable us to offer premium content to users for which they will be charged a monthly subscription fee. Users that sign up for a premium program will become Grom Club Members which will enable them to utilize current and new features to: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Create and view interactive videos that can be shared with other Grom Club Members, with non-paying Grom users and with any other third parties in their approved network; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive exclusive Gromatar options and accessories including masks, voice modification, face modification, special effects, and numerous filters. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Have unlimited access to new premium games;
--+--------------------------------------------


Ø | Engage in exclusive chats with athletes and celebrities that we hope to engage in the future;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive discounts on Grom Social merchandise;
--+----------------------------------------------


Ø | Turn off ads; and
--+------------------


Ø | Participate in Bookstore pre/reviews and live readings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Publishing and Distribution
 
We believe that Grom Social offers a great way to get user feedback and see how kids respond to content. We believe offering book titles to be previewed and added to wish lists for parents to purchase is a good way to get titles out to the Grom Social kids demographic.

5
-

 

Comments could be used for reviews and a rating star system could be implemented. Badges could be awarded to users to complete different book titles, similar to an online e-book store.
 
Authors could schedule a live reading where users would be able to log on during the live time-period and listen to the author live read a chapter of their book to the kids, with Q&A with the author live in public forum.
 

· | Online Game Fees. The games currently available to users on our website are free. We intend to offer users an option to pay to play exclusive games and/or pay for game upgrades. These games may be developed by us, such as Grom Skate, where the character skates through three worlds collecting coins, doing tricks and avoiding obstacles and solving geometry problems, or obtained from outside developers and adapted to use on our website. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing Merchandise Revenue. We hope to create Grom Social apparel and other merchandise for purchase through our website and mobile app and enter into licensing and merchandise agreements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Partnerships and Collaborations. The Company believes that due to its strong youth following that it can be a valuable resource to many organizations and sports leagues looking to build, reconnect and/or maintain their brand among the youth market. The Company has designed an opportunity for clients to utilize existing programming and broadcasts by condensing long programming such as 3-4 hour baseball games, 8 hour-a-day surfing events and 6-hour golf rounds into engaging short-form content wrapped in gaming and animation utilizing celebrities and athlete interaction.
· | Intellectual Property Strategy. The Company plans to produce, develop, license and purchase a number of intellectual properties and monetize by franchise, licensing and merchandising opportunities in addition to hosting on its own platform. To satisfy and help fill the demand for content, the Company intends to continue to create original content as well as use underutilized content. 

 
Throughout our monetization efforts, we will maintain a free version of the app in an effort to not negatively impact our user base. The Grom Social website and mobile app have generated nominal revenues to date.

Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to acquire synergistic companies, products or intellectual property that will help grow our Grom Social user base and operate profitably as both a stand-alone enterprise as well as enhance Grom’s overall monetization strategy.
 
Acquisition of TD Holdings Limited
 
On July 1, 2016, we entered into a share sale agreement (the “TDH Share Sale Agreement”) for the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of TD Holdings for which we paid $4,000,000 in cash, issued a 5% secured promissory note in the principal amount of $4,000,000 which originally matured on July 1, 2018 (the “TDH Note”), and 7,367,001 shares of our common stock valued at $4,240,000, or approximately $0.58 per share, to the selling shareholders of TDH (“TDH Sellers”).
 
Under the terms of the TDH Share Sale Agreement, we were also required to make additional payments (“Earnout Payments”) of up to $5,000,000 to the TDH Sellers, if TD Holdings achieved certain adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) during the three-year period following the acquisition (the “Earnout Period”), to be paid 25% in cash and the balance in shares of common stock at a share price equal to the lower of a 10% discount to our last private placement price per share prior to making the Earnout Payment, or if such shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange and publicly traded, at a 10% discount to the previous 20 day weighted average closing price per share.
 
No earnout was achieved for the original three-year Earnout Period. The original Earnout Period was extended to December 31, 2019, pursuant to the First Amendment described below. However, no earnout was achieved during the extended Earnout Period through December 31, 2019.

Third Amendment to the TDH Share Sale Agreement
 
On March 16, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the TDH Share Sale Agreement with the TDH Sellers (the “Third Amendment”). We used the proceeds received from the TDH Secured Notes Offering to pay the TDH Sellers $3,000,000 of the principal due under the TDH Notes, leaving an outstanding principal balance due to the TDH Sellers under the TDH Note of $1,000,000 in principal (plus accrued interest and costs).

Acquisition of the NetSpective Webfilter Assets 
 
On January 1, 2017, we acquired NetSpective webfilter assets from TeleMate.net Software, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, (“TeleMate”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “NetSpective APA”). Under the terms of the NetSpective APA, we issued a three-year 0.68% $1,000,000 redeemable, convertible promissory note to TeleMate (the “TeleMate Note”). The TeleMate Note is convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of $0.78 per share. If not converted by TeleMate by November 1, 2019, the note may be converted by the Company into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of $0.48 per share. In addition, we entered into a master services agreement (“MSA”) with TeleMate under which TeleMate provided engineering and sales support for twelve months and assumed all risks of NetSpective negative cash flow for one year.
 
Additionally, TeleMate was entitled to an earnout payment of up to $362,500, payable in our common stock at a price of $0.78 per share or 464,744 shares, if the NetSpective WebFilter assets generated $362,500 in “net cash flow” as defined in the NetSpective APA over a one-year period. Such net cash flow milestone was achieved and NetSpective became entitled to such earnout payment. However, TeleMate did not meet the terms of the MSA and failed to remit $146,882 collected on our behalf from NetSpective customers pursuant to the MSA. As a result, on January 12, 2018, we entered into a First Modification to the NetSpective APA (the “First Modification”).

Under the terms of the First Modification, TeleMate agreed to pay us in monthly installments of $10,000 against their outstanding balance of $146,822. Additionally, the TeleMate Note may not be converted or any earnout shares issued until the outstanding balance is paid in full, and all interest payments under the TeleMate Note were suspended until all payments owing the Company were made. If and when TeleMate is permitted to convert the TeleMate Note, the number of shares converted thereunder will be subject to a one-year leak-out agreement.
 
In April 2019, TeleMate paid the TeleMate Note in full. On December 4, 2019, the Company converted the outstanding principal and interest of $1,013,200 under the TeleMate Note into 2,113,428 shares of its common stock.
 
Acquisition of Curiosity Ink Media LLC
 
On August 19, 2021, we acquired 80% of the outstanding membership interest of Curiosity Ink Media LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Curiosity”) pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement (the “Curiosity MIPA”). Under the terms of the Curiosity MIPA, we issued an aggregate of 1,771,883 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Sellers, pro rata to their membership interests immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition. The shares were valued at $2.82 per share which represents to the 20-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock on August 19, 2021.
 
Additionally, the Company also paid $400,000 and issued an 8% eighteen-month convertible promissory note in the principal amount $278,000 (the “Note”) to pay-down and refinance certain outstanding loans and advances previously made to Curiosity by Russell Hicks and Brett Watts, members of Curiosity.
 
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $3.28 per share but may not be converted if, after giving effect to such conversion, the noteholder and its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Note may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part. The Note is subordinate to the Company’s senior indebtedness.
 
The Sellers also have the ability to earn up to $17,500,000 (payable 50% in cash and 50% in stock) upon the achievement of certain performance milestones as of December 31, 2025.
 
Business Strategy 
 
We hope to grow our business through a combination of marketing initiatives and synergistic acquisitions in an effort to increase our Grom Social user base to a large enough size to enable us to attract advertisers and paid users for our premium content. However, there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful or that our revenues will increase as a result of our business strategies.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our current growth strategy is as follows:
 

· | Increase the size of our database of users of Grom Social. Comparable to other successful social media companies, we believe the key strategy to our future success is to grow the size of our database. Although the revenue from Grom Social is now nominal, we believe that our database will continue to increase due to our production of original content. We intend to launch a marketing campaign, subject to raising sufficient capital, to increase awareness of the Grom Social platforms. There can be no assurance that we can continue to grow the Grom platforms, and if we are successful in doing so, that we will be able to generate revenues from the website and mobile app.

· | Marketing initiatives. We plan to use celebrities and high-profile athletes as role models, content providers and overall brand ambassadors. In January 2021, the Company entered into a long-term marketing agreement with American professional surfer and 2020 US Olympic surfing team member, 20-year-old Caroline Marks. 
· | Expand Core Products. We manage our brands through strategic product development initiatives, including introducing new products and modifying our existing intellectual property. Our marketing team and development teams strive to develop enhanced products to offer added technological, aesthetic and functional improvements to our portfolio of products. 


· | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We supplement our internal growth with strategic and synergistic acquisitions.

Competition
 
Grom Social
 
The markets in which we compete are characterized by innovation and new and rapidly evolving technologies. We believe we will face significant and intense competition in every aspect of our intended business, including from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google, which offer a variety of Internet products, services, and content that will compete for our user's Internet time and spending dollars. In addition to facing general competition from these large, well-funded companies, we also face competition from smaller Internet companies that offer products and services that may compete directly with Grom Social for users, such as TikTok, SnapChat, Video Star and Zoomerang. Additionally, as we introduce new services and products, as our existing services and products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition from:

· | Companies that offer products that replicate either partial or the full range of capabilities we intend to provide. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo-and video-sharing, and micro-blogging. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies that provide web-and mobile-based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage our target audience and capture time spent on mobile devices and online. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of these companies have substantially greater resources than us.

We believe that the following features differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a possible competitive advantage with respect to our target market:
 

· | We provide children with a social media experience in a safe and controlled environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide live monitoring of the website by trained individuals to help protect children from malicious content that may be found on other social networking sites available to children, supplemented by standard “bad word” filtering software; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have developed the only COPPA compliant app that offers live commenting, hashtags, streaming video content and the ability to record and share videos. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Grom Social is one of the only social media platforms that offers games, chatrooms, educational services, social interaction, exclusive content, global connectivity, and group collaboration to develop new content and activities based on user behavior in one platform.
 
TD Holdings
 
We have extensive competition in our animation business from production companies in Korea, Taiwan, Canada, India and, to a lesser degree, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Businesses in these countries, such as Malaysia, may receive government subsidies which can increase competitive pressure.
 
Our intention is for Top Draw Philippines to remain competitive for the production of family-oriented, animated television series and movies and other family-oriented entertainment products produced by major movie studios, including Disney, DreamWorks Animation, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Netflix, Nickelodeon, and numerous other independent motion picture production companies.
 
The primary competitors of Top Draw Philippines in the Philippines are Toon City Animation, Snipple Animation Studio, and Synergy 88 Digital.
 
Growth in the television industry is being driven by larger streaming companies such as Netflix, Disney Plus, NBC, Amazon Prime, and Facebook. Competition is primarily based on the ability to reach an audience directly and deliver products that meet consumer demand. The success of these streaming companies is primarily related to the size and reach of their user or subscriber base.
Grom Educational Services
 
We believe our primary competitors for web filtering products and services are iBoss, Lightspeed, Go Guardian and Securly. There are other large companies that offer web filtering products including Forcepoint (Websense), Bluecoat, Palo Alto Networks, Barracuda and Cisco. However, we believe these companies are enterprise focused whereby they sell numerous products with web filtering representing a minimal component of their portfolio.

Grom Nutritional Services
 
We believe that consumer awareness regarding the benefits of dietary supplements and new product availability are the major drivers for the market worldwide. The global nutritional supplements market size was valued at $273.9 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.4% over the forecast period from 2019 to 2025, according to Grand View Research. The largest of our competitors are Axxess Pharma Inc., Celsius Holdings, Inc., GNC Holdings Inc., and Pfizer Inc. 
Curiosity
 
We have extensive competition in our publication and animated series and movies are Disney, DreamWorks Animation, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Netflix and Nickelodeon. Growth in the publication and animated series and movies are driven by the large streaming and production companies.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to several U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy and data protection, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. including data protection regulation.
 
In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
 
Our platforms follow the guidelines of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501–6505. COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
 
Additionally, our K-12 NetSpective web filter clients are subject to CIPA, which was enacted by Congress in 2000 to address concerns about children's access to obscene or harmful content over the Internet. CIPA imposes certain requirements on schools or libraries that receive discounts for Internet access or internal connections through the E-rate program – a program that makes certain communications services and products more affordable for eligible schools and libraries. In early 2001, the FCC issued rules implementing CIPA and provided updates to those rules in 2011.
 
The nutritional supplements that we intend to market to children are governed by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA defines supplements as a product intended to increase its levels in the diet. These may include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, or other plant-based substances. Over-the-counter supplements do not undergo the same formal approval process as prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The FDA does not require supplement manufacturers to submit their products to the FDA for review nor receive FDA approval, however, before marketing, companies must ensure they are not making false claims on the product label to mislead consumers. Like other food substances, dietary supplements are not subject to the safety and efficacy testing requirements imposed on drugs, and unlike drugs they do not require prior approval by the FDA; however, they are subject to the FDA regulations regarding adulteration and misbranding.
