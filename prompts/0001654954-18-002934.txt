  Market overview – The United States wine industry has seen a rapid increase in the number of wineries that are being established throughout the country. From 1995 to 2017, U.S. wineries grew in number from 1,817 to 9,654, according to Todorov, and are one of the fastest growing segments in agriculture with an annual growth of 9% from 2016 to 2017. U.S. wineries increased production in 2016, the most recent year such data is available, by 5% and produced approximately 339 million cases according to The Wine Institute.
  
 The United States is the largest wine market in the world in terms of revenues and volume representing 13.4% of world consumption in 2015, the last year in which data is available. In 2017 U.S. wine sales reached $41.8 billion, according to Wines and Vines, a 2% increase from 2016. According to Gomberg Fredrickson Associates, U.S. wine shipments reached 403 million cases in 2017 with total US wine sales, domestic and import, revenue of $62.7 billion, according to Wines and Vines. U.S. wine sales have grown for 25 consecutive years and there were 550,000 locations that sell wine in 2016, the last year in which such data is available, an increase of 120,000 locations over the past 10 years according to Nielsen.
  
 According to the Wine Marketing Council U.S. consumers continue to enjoy wine with 120 million Americans, approximately 40% of the adult population, drinking wine in 2017. Of U.S. wine consumers 59% are female and 41% male with 35% of consumers drinking wine more than once per week according to the Wine Marketing Council. Domestic wine accounted for 66.7% of U.S. sales according to Wines and Vines. The five most popular wines are chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, red blends, pinot gris and pinot noir, according to Wine Business Monthly. Additionally, sparkling wines have seen double digit growth.
  
 In 2017, off-premise sales accounted for roughly 78% of the U.S. market with an average bottle price of $10 according to Nielsen. Although direct to consumer (DTC) sales represented less than 2% of the U.S. volume in 2017, such sales increased by 15.5% in 2017 from 2016 according to Sovos.
  
 In a 2015 American Wine Consumer Preference Survey, by Sonoma State University and the Wine Business Institute, American wine consumers from all 50 states were sampled regarding their wine consumption. Of those sampled, 56% reported they consume wine daily or several times per week making them “High Frequency Wine Drinkers” with the remaining 44% being occasional drinkers. Respondents demonstrated a preference for red wine, with 74% listing it as one of their favorites, and 78% considered themselves to have intermediate or advance knowledge of wine. Price and brand topped the list of decision making reasons when purchasing wine for home consumption with 32% listing the most common price being $10 to $15, 19% being $15 to $20 and 14% being more than $20. Additionally, 89% of respondents thought red wine was most healthy.

  The Oregon wine industry – Oregon is a relatively new wine-producing region in comparison to California and France. In 1966, there were only two commercial wineries licensed in Oregon. According to the Southern Oregon University Research Center (SOURCE) in 2016, the most recent year such data is available, there were 725 commercial wineries licensed in Oregon, an increase of 3.3% from 2015, and 30,435 planted acres of wine grape vineyards, 27,658 acres of which were harvested. Oregon wine grapes produced a 2016 crop with a total value of $168 million, a decrease of 4.6% from 2015 according to SOURCE. Pinot Noir leads all varieties accounting for 64% of planted acreage. According to SOURCE Oregon case sales in 2016 are estimated at 3.4 million, up from 3.1 million in 2015, a 10% increase helped by a 14% increase in national sales. SOURCE estimated case sales in dollars for 2016 to be approximately $529 million, a 12.4% increase from 2015.
  
 Because of climate, soil and other growing conditions, we believe the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally suited to growing superior quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregon’s Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines have developed outstanding reputations, winning numerous national and international awards. Though Oregon contributed only 1% of domestic wine production, it accounted for 21% of domestic wines that garnered a score of 90 points or higher by Wine Spectator in 2015.
  
 Oregon does have certain disadvantages as a new wine-producing region. Oregon’s wines are relatively little known to consumers worldwide and the total wine production of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French competitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give Oregon’s competitors certain financial, marketing, distribution and unit cost advantages.
 
 Furthermore, Oregon’s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that year’s wine quality.
  
 Finally, phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that feeds on the roots of grapevines, has been found in several commercial vineyards in Oregon. Contrary to the California experience, most Oregon phylloxera infestations have expanded very slowly and done only minimal damage. Nevertheless, phylloxera does constitute a significant risk to Oregon vineyards. Prior to the discovery of phylloxera in Oregon, all vine plantings in the Company’s Estate Vineyard, in Turner, Oregon, were with non-resistant rootstock. In 1997, the Company purchased Tualatin Vineyards at the Tualatin Winery, which has phylloxera at its site. All current plantings are with, and all future planting will be with phylloxera-resistant rootstock at that location. The Company takes commercially reasonable precautions in an effort to prevent the spread of phylloxera to its Turner site.
  
 As a result of these factors, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report, the Company believes that long-term prospects for growth in the Oregon wine industry are excellent. The Company believes that over the next several years the Oregon wine industry will grow at a faster rate than the overall domestic wine industry, and that much of this growth will favor producers of premium, super premium and ultra-premium wines such as the Company’s Estate, Elton and Griffin Creek brands.
  
  2016 Oregon harvest – The Oregon Vineyard and Winery Census Report states that 2016 saw increases in domestic sales for Oregon wine alongside reduced vineyard production. Pinot Noir continued to lead statewide production representing 64% of planted acreage and 57% of production. The overall number of wineries increased from 702 in 2015 to 725 in 2016 with the North Willamette Valley continuing to lead the state with 73% of total tons crushed.
  
  2017 Oregon harvest – There is no official data available on the 2017 Oregon harvest as of the date of this report.
  
  Company Strategy
  
 The Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its ability to: (1) grow and purchase high quality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium and ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant brand recognition for its wines, first in Oregon and then nationally and internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base of direct to consumer sales. The Company’s goal is to continue to build on a reputation for producing some of Oregon’s finest, most sought-after wines.

 Based upon several highly regarded surveys of the U.S. wine industry, the Company believes that successful wineries exhibit the following four key attributes: (i) focus on production of high-quality premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietal wines; (ii) achieve brand positioning that supports high bottle prices for its high quality wines; (iii) build brand recognition by emphasizing restaurant sales; and (iv) develop strong marketing advantages (such as a highly visible winery location, successful support of distribution, and life-long customer service programs).
  
 To successfully execute this strategy, the Company has assembled a team of accomplished winemaking professionals and has constructed and equipped the Estate Winery into a 12,784 square foot state-of-the-art winery that includes a 12,500 square foot outdoor production area for the harvesting, pressing and fermentation of wine grapes.
  
 The Company’s marketing and selling strategy is to sell its premium, super premium and ultra-premium cork-finished-wine through a combination of direct sales at the Estate Winery, the McMinnville Tasting Room in McMinnville, Oregon and Tualatin Estate Winery and sales through independent distributors and wine brokers who market the Company’s wine in specific targeted areas.
  
 The Company believes the location of the Estate Winery next to Interstate 5, Oregon’s major north-south freeway, significantly increases direct sales opportunities to consumers. The Company believes this location provides high visibility for the Winery to passing motorists, thus enhancing recognition of the Company’s products in retail outlets and restaurants. We also believe the Company’s remodeled Hospitality Center, at the Estate Winery, has further increased the Company’s direct sales and enhanced public recognition of its wines.
  
 To remain competitive in the premium, super premium and ultra-premium market, the Company has embarked on a brand expansion project and is in the process of developing a brand and future winery in the Walla Walla AVA under the name Pambrun. This future winery is expected to produce small vintages of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals to compete in the ultra-premium wine market. The Company intends to release wines under the Pambrun label beginning with the 2015 vintage year. Additionally, the Company has developed a single vineyard brand near Hopewell, Oregon adjacent to the current site of Elton Vineyards to produce wine under the Elton label. This brand is expected to produce primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, also for sale in the ultra-premium space. The Company has recently released wines under the Elton label beginning with the 2015 vintage year and plans to complete facility construction in 2020. In June 2016 the Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge AVA and is in the process of planning vineyard development and a small single vineyard brand offering. In December 2016 the Company purchased approximately 40 acres in the Dundee, Oregon area, purchased another 17 acres in January 2017 and is in the process of developing a plan for the use and development of that property.
  
  Vineyards
  
 The Company owns and leases approximately 913 acres of land, of which 691 acres are currently planted as vineyards or is suitable for future vineyard planting. The vineyards the Company owns and leases are all certified sustainable by LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology) and Salmon Safe. At full production, the Company anticipates these vineyards would enable the Company to grow approximately 63% of the grapes needed to meet the winery’s current production capacity, of 442,000 gallons (186,000 cases), at its Estate Winery.

  WVV Estate –Established in 1983, the Company’s Estate Vineyard (the “Estate Vineyard”) is located at the Winery location south of Salem, near Turner, Oregon. The Estate Vineyard uses an elaborate trellis design known as the Geneva Double Curtain. The Company has incurred the additional expense of constructing this trellis because it doubles the number of canes upon which grape clusters grow and spreads these canes for additional solar exposure and air circulation. Research and practical applications of this trellis design indicate that it should improve grape quality through smaller clusters and berries over traditional designs. The Company planted one and one half acre in 2017. The Company does not intend to plant at WVV Estate in 2018.
  
  Tualatin Estate Vineyard – Established in 1973 at the Tualatin Winery location near Forest Grove, Oregon, the Company’s Tualatin Estate Vineyards is one of the oldest vineyards in Oregon. It was purchased by the Company in 1997. A series of sale-leaseback transactions split the property into two additional vineyards, and the Company continues to lease and manage the Peter Michael Vineyard and Meadowview Vineyard, located adjacent to the Tualatin Vineyard. The Company does not intend to plant at Tualatin Estate Vineyard in 2018.
  
  Ingram Estate and Elton Vineyard – The Company purchased 86 acres near Hopewell, Oregon, for vineyard plantings. Adjacent to the purchased land is an additional 110 leased acres, also for vineyard development. The Company believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Noir and planted 16 acres in 2017. The Ingram site is also adjacent to Elton Vineyards, where the Company leases 54 acres of established vineyards. The Company planted 17 acres at leased Ingram in 2017 and intends to plant the final 6 leased acres in 2018.
  
  Pambrun Vineyards – In 2015, the Company purchased 42 acres in the Walla Walla AVA near the town of Milton-Freewater, Oregon. Additionally, the Company purchased an additional 45 adjoining acres in 2017. The Company believes this site is ideal to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals. Wines produced from this vineyard are expected to be sold under the Pambrun label. The Company planted 4 acres in 2017 and does not intend to plant in 2018.
  
   
8


  
 
 
  Loeza Vineyard – The Company purchased 62 acres near Gaston, Oregon in 2014, for vineyard plantings, and believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Gris. The site is close to Tualatin Vineyards which allows the Company to leverage existing crews for vineyard development and operations. The Company planted 35 acres in 2017 and intends to plant 20 acres in 2018.
  
  Louisa Vineyard – The Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA in 2016 for vineyard plantings and believes the site is suitable for growing ultra-premium Pinot Noir. The Company does not intend to plant at Louisa Vineyard in 2018.
  
  Rocks Vineyard – The Company purchased approximately 37 acres in the new Rocks District of Milton-Freewater appellation near Milton-Freewater, Oregon in 2016. The Company intends to plant 5 acres in 2018.
  
  Bernau Estate – The Company purchased approximately 17 acres in Dundee, Oregon in January 2017 comprised of 15 acres of producing Pinot Noir. Additionally, the Company leases 20 adjoining acres. The Company intends to plant 11 acres in 2018
  
  Dayton Vineyard – The Company purchased 40 acres in Dayton, Oregon in December 2016. The Company has no plans for planting this site in 2018.
  
  Grape Vines - Beginning in 1997, the Company embarked on a major effort to improve the quality of its flagship varietal by planting new Pinot Noir clones that originated directly from the cool climate growing region of Burgundy rather than the previous source, Napa, California, where winemakers believe the variety adapted to the warmer climate over the many years it was grown there.
  
 These new French clones are called “Dijon clones” after the University of Dijon in Burgundy, which assisted in their selection and shipment to a U.S. government authorized quarantine site, and then two years later to Oregon winegrowers. The most desirable of these new Pinot Noir clones are numbered 113, 114, 115, 667, 777 and 943. In addition to certain flavor advantages, these clones ripen up to two weeks earlier, allowing growers to pick before heavy autumn rains. Heavy rains can dilute concentrated fruit flavors and promote bunch rot and spoilage. These Pinot Noir clones were planted at the Tualatin Vineyards with phylloxera-resistant rootstock and the 667 and 777 clones have been grafted onto seven acres of self-rooted, non-phylloxera-resistant vines at the Company’s Estate Vineyard.
  
 New clones of Chardonnay preceded Pinot Noir into Oregon and were planted at the Company’s Estate Vineyard on phylloxera-resistant rootstock.
  
  Grape supply – In 2017, the Company’s producing acres in the Estate Vineyard yielded approximately 321 tons of grapes. Tualatin/Peter Michael/Meadowview Vineyards produced an aggregate of 1,075 tons of grapes in 2017. Elton and Ingram Vineyards produced 245 tons of grapes in 2017. Bernau Estate produced 69 tons of grapes in 2017.
  
 The Company fulfills its remaining grape needs by purchasing grapes from other nearby vineyards at competitive prices. In 2017, the Company purchased an additional 1,712 tons of grapes from other growers. The Company cannot grow enough grapes to meet anticipated production needs, and therefore contracts grape purchases to make up the difference. Contracted grape purchases are considered an important component of the Company’s long-term growth and risk-management plan. The Company believes high quality grapes will be available for purchase in sufficient quantity to meet the Company’s requirements. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to purchase properties for future vineyards.
  
 The grapes grown on the Company’s vineyards establish a foundation of quality, through the Company’s farming practices, upon which the quality of the Company’s wines is built. In addition, wine produced from grapes grown in the Company’s own vineyards may be labeled as “Estate Bottled” wines. These wines traditionally sell at a premium over non-estate bottled wines.

  Viticultural conditions – Oregon’s Willamette Valley is recognized as a premier location for growing certain varieties of high quality wine grapes, particularly Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Riesling. The Company believes that the Estate Vineyard’s growing conditions, including its soil, elevation, slope, rainfall, evening marine breezes and solar orientation are among the most ideal conditions in the United States for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes. The Estate Vineyard’s grape growing conditions compare favorably to those found in some of the famous Viticultural regions of France. Western Oregon’s latitude (42o–46o North) and relationship to the eastern edge of a major ocean is very similar to certain centuries-old wine grape growing regions of France.
  
 The Estate Vineyard’s soil type is Jory/Nekia, a dark, reddish-brown, silky clay loam over basalt bedrock, noted for being well drained, acidic, of adequate depth, retentive of appropriate levels of moisture and particularly suited to growing high quality wine grapes.
  
 The Estate Vineyard’s elevation ranges from 533 feet to 800 feet above sea level with slopes from 2% to 30% (predominately 12-20%). The Estate Vineyard’s slope is oriented to the south, southwest and west. Average annual precipitation at the Estate Vineyard is 41.3 inches; average annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit, and the length of each year’s frost-free season averages from 190 to 210 days. These conditions compare favorably with conditions found throughout the Willamette Valley viticultural region and other domestic and foreign viticultural regions, which produce high quality wine grapes.
  
 In the Willamette Valley, permanent vineyard irrigation generally is not required. The average annual rainfall provides sufficient moisture to avoid the need to irrigate the Estate Vineyard. However, if the need should arise, the Company’s Estate property contains one water well which can sustain sufficient volume to meet the needs of the Winery and to provide auxiliary water to the Estate Vineyard for new plantings and unusual drought conditions. At the Tualatin Vineyard, the Company has water rights to a year round spring that feeds an irrigation pond. Additionally, the Company has water rights at the Pambrun and Rocks Vineyards.
  
  Susceptibility of vineyards to disease – The Tualatin Vineyard and the adjacent leased vineyards are known to be infested with phylloxera, an aphid-like insect, which can destroy vines.
  
 It is not possible to estimate any range of loss that may be incurred due to the phylloxera infestation of the Company’s vineyards. The phylloxera at Tualatin Vineyard is believed to have been introduced on the roots of the vines first planted on the property in the southern most section Gewurztraminer in 1971 that the Company partially removed in 2004. The remaining vines, and all others infested, remain productive at low crop levels. The Company is in the process of gradually replacing infested areas with new, phylloxera-resistant vines.
  
  Winery
  
  Wine production facility – The Company’s Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing up to 186,000 cases (442,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2017, the Winery produced approximately 151,332 cases (359,900 gallons) from its 2015 and 2016 harvest. The Company expects to produce approximately 153,300 cases (364,500 gallons) in 2018 from its 2016 and 2017 harvests.
  
 The Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging and bottling wine, as well as an underground wine cellar, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes, and a 4,500 square foot insulated storage facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 cases of wine. The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage building to store its inventory of bottled product with a capacity of approximately 135,000 cases of wine. The production area is equipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in compliance with environmental regulations.
  
 In addition to the production capacity discussed above, the Tualatin Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately 25,000 cases (59,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The capacity at the Tualatin Winery is available to the Company to meet any anticipated future production needs. In 2008, the Company replaced the roof and production floor, insulation and walls, in anticipation of using it for wine storage and future production.

  Hospitality facility – The Company has a renovated tasting and hospitality facility of 35,642 square feet (the “Hospitality Center”) at the Estate Winery. The main floor of the Hospitality Center includes retail sales space with the Estate Tasting Room, Club Room for Wine Club Members, dining area and mezzanine, which altogether are designed to accommodate approximately 300 persons for tastings, wine and food pairing meals, public and private events and meetings. An iconic observation tower and tiered decks around the Hospitality Center enable visitors to enjoy the view of the Willamette Valley and the Company’s Estate Vineyard. The tiered decks funnel into an outdoor courtyard that hosts many seasonal gatherings. To the south side of the tiered decks the Company has two hospitality suites for overnight accommodations. The Hospitality Center sits above the underground barrel cellar and tunnel that connects with the Winery. The facility includes a basement cellar, tunnel and barrel room of 11,090 square feet to store up to 1,800 barrels of wine for aging in the proper environment.
  
  Just outside the Hospitality Center, the Company has a landscaped park setting consisting of terraced lawns for outdoor events. The area between the Winery and Hospitality Center form a 20,000 square foot quadrangle. As designed, a removable fabric top can cover the quadrangle, making it an all-weather outdoor facility to promote the sale of the Company’s wines through festivals and social events. Above the Company’s working Winery houses the Pinot Room and Founders’ Room, which can accommodate 40 persons and 111 persons for public and private events.
  
  The Company believes the Hospitality Center and surrounding areas make the Winery an attractive recreational and social destination for tourists and residents, thereby enhancing the Company’s ability to sell its wines.
  
  Mortgages on properties – The Company’s winery facilities at the Estate Winery are subject to two mortgages with an aggregate principal balance of $7,202,727 at December 31, 2017. The two outstanding loans require monthly principal and interest payments of $62,067 for the life of the loans, at annual fixed interest rates of 4.75% and 5.21%, and with maturity dates of 2028 and 2032.
  
  Wine production – The Company operates on the principle that winemaking is a natural but highly technical process requiring the attention and dedication of the winemaking staff. The Company’s Winery is equipped with current technical innovations and uses modern laboratory equipment and computers to monitor the progress of each wine through all stages of the winemaking process.
  
 The Company’s recent annual grape harvest and wine production is as follows:

  Sales and Distribution
  
  Marketing strategy – The Company markets and sells its wines through a combination of direct sales at the Winery, directly through mailing lists, and through distributors and wine brokers. As the Company has increased production volumes and achieved greater brand recognition, sales to out of state markets have increased, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total Company sales.
  
  The Company uses a variety of marketing channels to generate interest in its wines. The Company has a highly functional website and maintains social media sites. The Company controls a database of customers for email and direct promotions. The Company continues to submit its wines to competitions and state, regional and national media for editorials and ratings.
  
  Direct sales – The Company’s Estate Winery is located on a visible hill adjacent to Oregon’s major north-south freeway (Interstate 5), approximately 2 miles south of the state’s second-largest metropolitan area (Salem), and 50 miles in either direction from the state’s first and third-largest metropolitan areas (Portland and Eugene). The unique location along Interstate 5 has resulted in generally greater amount of wines sold at the Estate Winery as compared to the Oregon industry standard. Direct sales from the Winery are a vital and growing sales channel and an effective means of product promotion. The Estate Winery Tasting Room is open daily and offers wine tasting and education by trained personnel. The Company offers a complimentary daily tour along with by-appointment private tours offering a behind-the-scenes look at the production process of the wines. The Company has the largest wine club membership in Oregon and features a Members-only Club Room at the Estate Winery.
  
  In 2014, the Company launched “Pairings,” a focused restaurant offering a wine and food pairing lunch. Led by the Winery chef, the menu highlights Northwest fresh dishes paired thoughtfully with the Company’s wines. The culinary offering has now expanded to include “Pairings Food & Wine Experiences,” community-style wine dinners hosted on the weekends. 
  
  The Winery has developed a strong Winery Ambassador program, which connects its “Ambassadors” with customers throughout the United States and offers personalized wine recommendations and easy ordering by phone or email.
  
  The Company also operates two additional tasting rooms; one in historic downtown McMinnville, in the heart of Oregon Wine Country, and at its Tualatin Vineyard (located 30 minutes west of Portland).
  
 The Company holds four major festivals at the Winery each year. In addition, open houses are held at the Winery during major holiday weekends such as Memorial Day and Thanksgiving. Numerous private events, charitable and political events are also held at the Winery.
  
 Direct sales produce a higher profit margin because the Company is able to sell its wine directly to consumers at retail prices rather than to distributors at free-on-board or “FOB” prices. Sales made directly to consumers at retail prices result in an increased profit margin equal to the difference between retail prices and distributor prices. For 2017 and 2016, direct sales contributed approximately 40% and 36% of the Company’s net sales, respectively.
  
  Distributors and wine brokers – The Company uses both independent distributors and wine brokers primarily to market the Company’s wines in specific targeted areas. Only those distributors and wine brokers who have demonstrated knowledge of and a proven ability to market premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines are utilized. The Company’s products are distributed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, and there are 5 non-domestic (export) customers. For 2017 and 2016, sales to distributors and wine brokers contributed approximately 60% and 64% of the Company’s revenue from operations, respectively.
  
  Tourists – Oregon wineries are a popular tourist destination with many bed & breakfasts, motels and fine restaurants available. The Willamette Valley, Oregon’s leading wine region has approximately 76% of the state’s wineries and vineyards, is home to approximately 554 wineries and was selected by Wine Enthusiast Magazine as its 2016 Wine Region of the Year. An additional advantage for Willamette Valley wine tourism is the proximity of the wineries to Portland (Oregon’s largest city and most popular destination). From Portland, tourists can visit the Willamette Valley winery of their choice in anywhere from a 45 minutes to a two hour drive.

 The Company believes its convenient location, adjacent to Interstate 5, enables the Winery to attract a significant number of visitors. The Winery is approximately a 45 minute drive from Portland and less than one mile from The Enchanted Forest, a popular amusement park which operates from April through September each year.
  
  Dependence on Major Customers
  
 Historically, the Company’s revenue has been derived from thousands of customers annually. In 2017, sales to one distributor represented approximately 18.2% of total Company revenue. In 2016, sales to one distributor represented approximately 19.0% of total Company revenue.
 Research and Development
  
 The nature of the Company’s business does not require the Company to incur a material amount of research and development expense.
  
  Competition
  
 The wine industry is highly competitive. In a broad sense, wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Within the wine industry, the Company believes that its principal competitors include wineries in Oregon, California and Washington, which, like the Company, produce premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines. Wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have significantly greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources than the Company. Currently, no Oregon winery dominates the Oregon wine market. Several Oregon wineries, however, are older and better established and have greater label recognition than that of the Company.
  
 The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the premium, super premium, and ultra-premium segment of the wine industry are product quality, price, label recognition, and product supply. The Company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors. The Company has primarily received “Excellent” to “Recommended” reviews in tastings of its wines and believes its prices are competitive with other Oregon wineries. Larger scale production is necessary to satisfy retailers’ and restaurants’ demand and the Company believes that additional production capacity will be needed to meet estimated future demand. Furthermore, the Company believes that its estimated production capacity of 501,000 gallons (211,000 cases) per year at its Estate Vineyards and Tualatin Vineyard locations give it significant competitive advantages over most Oregon wineries in areas such as marketing, distribution arrangements, grape purchasing, and access to financing. The current production level of most Oregon wineries is generally much smaller than the estimated production capacity level of the Company’s Wineries. With respect to label recognition, the Company believes that its unique structure as a consumer-owned company will give it a significant advantage in gaining market share in Oregon, as well as penetrating other wine markets.
  
  Governmental Regulation of the Wine Industry
  
 The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. The Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of these governmental agencies. Sale of the Company’s wine is subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of the Winery for shipment to customers or for sale in its tasting room.
  
 The 2017 federal alcohol tax rate was $1.07 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0% and $1.57 per gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0%; however, wineries that produce not more than 250,000 gallons during the calendar year were allowed a graduated tax credit of up to $0.90 per gallon on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than sparkling wines) removed from the bonded area during that year.
  
 In December 2017, the federal government passed comprehensive tax legislation which included the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act. This legislation modified federal alcohol tax rates by expanding the lower $1.07 per gallon tax rate to wines up to 16.0% alcohol content. Additionally, the legislation provides for a $1 credit per gallon for the first 30,000 gallons produced; $0.90 for the next 100,000 gallons; and then $0.535 for up to 750,000 gallons. These modifications are effective January 2018 and are effective for two years.

 The Company also pays the state of Oregon an excise tax of $0.67 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0% and $0.77 per gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0% on all wine sold in Oregon. In addition, most states in which the Company’s wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. As an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and, as a producer of wastewater, by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The Company has secured all necessary permits to operate its business.
  
 Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
  
  Costs and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws
  
 The Company management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and consumers of its wine. Although much of the Company’s expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, the Company is regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws. However, these regulatory costs and processes are effectively integrated into the Company’s regular operations and consequently do not generally cause significant alternative processes or costs.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2017 the Company had approximately 112 full-time employees and 54 part-time employees. In addition, the Company hires additional employees for seasonal work as required. The Company’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.
