 Item 1. Business
 Description of Business
 TPI Composites, Inc. is the holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or we). The Company was founded in 1968 and has been producing composite wind blades since 2001. The Company is incorporated in Delaware.
Overview
 We are the only independent manufacturer of composite wind blades for the wind energy market with a global manufacturing footprint. We enable many of the industry’s leading wind turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to outsource the manufacturing of some of their wind blades through our global footprint of advanced manufacturing facilities strategically located to serve large and growing wind markets in a cost-effective manner. Given the importance of wind energy capture, turbine reliability and cost to power producers, the size, quality and performance of wind blades is highly strategic to our OEM customers. As a result, we have become a key supplier to our OEM customers in the manufacture of wind blades and related precision molding and assembly systems. We have entered into supply agreements pursuant to which we dedicate capacity at our facilities to our customers in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets (each set consisting of three wind blades). This collaborative dedicated supplier model provides us with contracted volumes that generate significant revenue visibility, drive capital efficiency and allow us to produce wind blades at a lower total delivered cost, while ensuring critical dedicated capacity for our customers.

We also provide field service inspection and repair services to our OEM customers and wind farm owners and operators. Our field service inspection and repairs services include diagnostic, repair and maintenance service offerings for wind blades that have been installed on wind turbines located at wind farms. Our field service inspection and repair services can be performed up-tower, where a blade technician performs these services in the air or from the wind turbine tower on a wind turbine blade, or down tower, where a blade is first removed from a wind turbine and these services are performed on the ground at the wind farm site or in a repair facility.
 
We also leverage our advanced composite technology and history of innovation to supply high strength, lightweight and durable composite products to the transportation market. In June 2021, we extended our supply agreement with Proterra, Inc. (Proterra) to supply Proterra Catalyst® composite bus bodies through December 2024. In 2019, we made a capital investment of approximately $11.5 million to develop a highly automated manufacturing line for the electric vehicle market within our Warren, Rhode Island facility to enable us to further develop our technology, create defensible product and process intellectual property (IP) and demonstrate our capability to manufacture composite components cost effectively at automotive volume rates. In 2021, we began a production program to manufacture a composite component for an electric vehicle manufacturer using this automated production line and have commenced production of additional composites components for this manufacturer in 2022. We manufactured approximately 26,000 production components in 2021 and anticipate manufacturing 25,000 production components in the first half of 2022. We continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities and have received orders with a major OEM to produce approximately 450,000 production components in 2022 and approximately 1,000,000 in 2023.
 Our wind blade and precision molding and assembly systems manufacturing businesses accounted for approximately 95%, 96%, and 96% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of February 24, 2022, our wind and transportation supply agreements provide for minimum aggregate volume commitments from our customers of approximately $2.2 billion and encourage our customers to purchase additional volume up to, in the aggregate, a total contract value of approximately $3.5 billion through the end of 2024.

 Business Strategy
 Our long-term success will be driven by our business strategy. The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:
 •Capitalize on the long-term, global trends of decarbonization of the electric sector and the electrification of vehicles. We believe we are well-positioned to participate and benefit from the long term, global trend of decarbonization of the electric sector. Although regulatory uncertainty, as well as permitting, siting and transmission challenges in the U.S. and Europe has tempered demand for wind energy in the near term, we expect global demand for renewable energy, and wind energy in particular, will continue to grow in the long term due to a multitude of factors, including: increased cost competitiveness of wind energy compared to fossil fuel generated electricity; increased demand from corporations and utility providers for renewable energy; and recent international policy initiatives designed to promote the growth of renewable energy. We believe our global footprint of manufacturing facilities will allow us to capitalize on the expected long term, global growth of wind energy. Similarly, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the projected growth of electric vehicles. As the global vehicle electrification trend continues, reducing the weight of these vehicles is critical to expanding range and/or providing more room for additional batteries or reducing the number of batteries. We believe vehicle manufacturers and vehicle owners will also benefit from the lower cost of total ownership due to the durability and the non-corrosive properties of composites compared to metallic materials along with the ability to scale production with lower production investment costs. As a result, we expect there will be an increased demand for composites products for electric vehicles. In addition, we believe there is a potential demand in other strategic markets for composites to replace aluminum or other more expensive composite materials such as carbon reinforcements.
 •Grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships with leading industry OEMs. We plan to continue growing and expanding our relationships with existing customers who, according to data 


from BloombergNEF (Bloomberg), represented approximately 37% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 76% of that market excluding China, and 89% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2020, based on megawatts (MWs) of energy capacity installed, as well as developing new relationships with other leading industry OEMs. We expect to be presented with opportunities to expand our existing relationships and develop new relationships with industry OEMs as they seek to capitalize on the benefits of outsourced wind blade manufacturing while maintaining high quality customization and dedicated capacity. In July 2020, General Electric International, Inc. and its affiliates (GE Wind) agreed to extend our existing supply agreement in one of our Mexico plants by two years to 2022, and added one additional wind blade manufacturing line in Mexico to provide blades for GE Wind’s turbine technologies in North America. In July 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Nordex SE (Nordex) for two additional manufacturing lines in our Chennai, India facility, and we commenced production in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with Nordex to takeover production at Nordex’s existing manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico through June 2024. In September 2021, we extended our supply agreement with Nordex at one of our Izmir, Turkey plants by one year through December 2022. In December 2021, we agreed to extend our supply agreement with Vestas at one of our Izmir, Turkey plants for an additional year through December 2023.
 •Leverage our footprint in large and growing wind markets, capitalize on the continuing outsourcing trend, evaluate building wind blades for the growing offshore wind market and evaluate strategic acquisitions. As many wind turbine OEMs continue to shift towards increased outsourcing of wind blade manufacturing, we believe we are well-positioned with our global footprint. We utilize our strengths in composites technology and manufacturing, combined with our collaborative dedicated supplier model to provide our customers with an efficient solution for their expansion in large and growing onshore wind markets. We also are evaluating opportunities to manufacture wind blades for the growing offshore wind market. In addition, our demonstrated ability to enter into new markets and the strength of our manufacturing capabilities afford us the optionality to build new factories or grow through strategic acquisitions.
 •Continue to drive down costs of wind energy. We continue to work with our customers on larger size wind blade models that maximize the capture of wind energy and drive down the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). We also continue to utilize our advanced technology, regional manufacturing facilities strategically located to cost effectively serve large and growing wind markets and ability to source materials globally at competitive costs to deliver high-performing, composite wind blades. Our collaborative engineering approach and our advanced precision molding and assembly systems allow us to integrate our customer’s design requirements with cost-efficient, replicable and scalable manufacturing processes. This collaborative engineering approach with our customers also allows us to reduce manufacturing cycle times, new line and factory start up times and new blade model transition times. We also continue to work with our customers to drive down or minimize the impacts of increases in the cost of materials and production, the benefit of which we typically share with our customers contractually in a manner that reduces LCOE for customers, further strengthens our customer relationships and improves our margins.
 •Expand our field service inspection and repair business and introduce new ancillary products and services to help our customers better manage the full life cycle of a wind blade. We plan to continue to expand our field service inspection and repair business by leveraging our existing wind blade manufacturing and composites expertise and global footprint. We believe there is an increasing demand and growing market for experienced wind blade inspection and repair services worldwide as the number of wind turbines installed worldwide continues to grow and the fleet of existing wind turbines continues to age. We also expect that the operating margins at our field service inspection and repair business will improve in 2022 and will be higher than the operating margins of our wind blade manufacturing business in future periods. We also are seeking to develop a more comprehensive suite of products and services such as wind blade design, engineering and recycling services to help our customers better manage the full life cycle of a wind turbine blade. 
 •Focus on continuing innovation. We have a history of innovation in advanced composite technologies and production techniques and use several proprietary technologies related to wind blade manufacturing. With this culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” 


approach, we continue to address increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications and strict quality control requirements for our customers’ most advanced wind blades. We also invest in ongoing simplification and selective automation of production processes for increased efficiency and precision. In addition, we plan to leverage our history of composite industry-first innovations to grow our business in the transportation market, in which we believe there is a demand for high precision, structural composites manufacturing as well as high-speed, high-volume manufacturing of structural composite components, particularly in the transportation market.
Wind Blade Manufacturing Operations and Process
 We have developed significant expertise in advanced composite technology and use high performance composite materials, precision molding and assembly systems including modular tooling, and advanced process technology, as well as sophisticated measurement, inspection, testing and quality assurance tools, allowing us to produce over 75,000 wind blades since 2001 with a strong, long-term field performance record in a market where reliability is critical to our customers’ success. We manufacture or have manufactured wind blades ranging from 30 meters to approximately 80 meters in length across our global facilities and have the capability to manufacture wind blades of greater lengths as required by existing or new customers. In combination with our advanced technologies, we seek to create manufacturing processes that are replicable and scalable in our manufacturing facilities located worldwide, regardless of cultural or language barriers. Using continuous improvement principles, we can customize each manufacturing step, from raw materials to finished products. This also allows us to systematically design for the entire manufacturing process so that we can achieve better quality control and increase production efficiencies. We believe that our focus on simplifying and, where feasible, automating production processes is critical to manufacturing high-precision, lightweight and durable products at a reasonable cost to our customers. We produce high unit volumes of near-aerospace grade products at industrial costs.
Raw Materials
 The key raw materials for the wind blades we manufacture include highly advanced fiberglass fabrics, select carbon reinforcements, foam, balsa wood, resin, adhesives for assembly of molded components, gel coat or paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces and attachment hardware including steel components. Most of these materials are available in multiple geographic regions and in reasonably close proximity to our manufacturing facilities. Our agreements for the supply of raw materials are designed to secure volumes that we believe will be required to fulfill our customers’ wind blade commitments for fixed prices with limited contractual price adjustment provisions. A portion of our raw materials are subject to price volatility, such as the resins and carbon reinforcements used in our manufacturing processes. During 2021, there have been both significant price increases and supply constraints with respect to resins and carbon fiber, which are key raw materials that we use to manufacture our products, as well as increases in logistics costs to obtain raw materials. These increases in raw materials and related logistics adversely affected our results of operations by approximately $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 Although the majority of materials incorporated into our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers. We seek multiple suppliers for our raw materials and continually evaluate potential new supplier relationships. Our largest customer, however, sources all of the critical raw materials that we use to produce such customers' wind blades. Since we do not source procurement of these raw materials for our largest customer, we have fewer controls and remedies to mitigate raw material and supply chain risks and disruptions relating to such raw materials. For example, we experienced production delays and reduced production volumes in 2021 at our Matamoros, Mexico and Izmir, Turkey manufacturing facilities due to carbon and other raw material shortages that were sourced by a customer.
 Precision Molding and Assembly Systems
 Over the last decade, we have produced hundreds of precision molding and assembly systems, ranging from 30 meters to approximately 80 meters in length, to support our global operations. In 2020, we transitioned our North American precision molding and assembly system production capabilities to a new facility in Juárez, Mexico, which serves customers globally. Our precision molding and assembly systems have been used to build tens of thousands of wind blades worldwide.


Our tooling solutions include precision wind blade patterns, precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques. We believe that our technological and production expertise are key factors in our continued competitiveness, as we address continually increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications, and strict quality control requirements for wind blades.
 Wind Blade Production Process
 Production of wind blades requires adherence to the unique specifications of each of our customers, who design their wind turbines and wind blades to optimize performance, reliability and total delivered cost. With our culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” approach, we have the capability and expertise to manufacture wind blades of different designs, utilizing fiberglass, carbon fiber, or other advanced composite materials to meet unique customer specifications. We also have the flexibility to quickly transition our manufacturing facilities to produce different wind blade models and sizes using our precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques.
 We have developed a highly dependable method for making high-quality wind blades. In conjunction with our continuous improvement principles, we design our proprietary manufacturing processes to be replicable, scalable and transferable to each of our advanced manufacturing facilities worldwide. As a result, we can repeatedly move a product from its design phase to volume production while maintaining quality, even in developing regions of the world. Similarly, we have developed the manual portions of our manufacturing processes based on proven technologies and production methods that can be learned and implemented rapidly by line personnel. We focus on consistency and quality control across our facilities, using hands-on training methods and employing repeatable manufacturing processes.
 We use an advanced form of vacuum-assisted resin transfer tooling process to pull liquid resin into a dry lay-up, resulting in light, strong, and reliable composite structures. In our manufacturing process, fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up in a mold while dry, followed by a vacuum bag that is placed over the layup and sealed to the mold. The wind blade component is then placed under vacuum. The resin is introduced into the wind blade component via resin inlet ports and then distributed through the reinforcement and core materials via a flow medium and a series of channels, saturating the wind blade component. The vacuum removes air and gases during processing, thereby eliminating voids. Pressure differentials drive resin uniformly throughout the wind blade component, providing a consistent laminate. By using a variety of reinforcement and core materials, the structural characteristics of the wind blade can be highly engineered to suit the custom specifications of our customers. Although only occasionally required by our customers, we are also capable of employing additional composite fabrication processes, such as pre-impregnated laminates, in addition to our vacuum infusion process.
 Wind Blade Supply Agreements
 Our current wind blade customers, which include Vestas, GE Wind, Nordex, and ENERCON GmbH (ENERCON), are some of the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers. According to data from Bloomberg, our customers represented approximately 37% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 76% of that market excluding China, and 89% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2020, based on MWs of energy capacity installed. In our collaborative dedicated supplier model, our customers are incentivized to maximize the volume of wind blades purchased through lower pricing at higher purchase volumes. As of February 24, 2022, our existing wind blade supply agreements provide for minimum aggregate volume commitments from our customers of approximately $2.2 billion and encourage our customers to purchase additional volume up to, in the aggregate, a total contract value of approximately $3.5 billion through the end of 2024, which we believe provides us with significant future revenue visibility and helps to insulate us from potential short-term fluctuations or legislative changes in any one market. Our supply agreements generally contain liquidated damages provisions in the event of late delivery, however, we generally do not bear the responsibility for transporting the wind blades we manufacture to our customers.
 Our supply agreements with our customers generally provide downside protection for us through minimum annual volume commitments, as well as encourage our customers to maximize the volume of wind blades they purchase from us, since purchasing less than a specified amount typically triggers higher pricing. Some of our supply agreements also provide for annual sales price reductions reflecting assumptions regarding increases in our

manufacturing efficiency and productivity. We work to continue to drive down or minimize the impact of increases in the cost of materials and production through innovation and global sourcing, a portion of the benefit of which we share with our customers contractually, further strengthening our deep customer relationships. Similarly, we typically share any raw material price increases with our customers. Our largest customer, however, sources all of the critical raw materials that we use to produce its wind blades and this customer assumes 100% of any such raw material price increases or decreases. Wind blade pricing is based on annual commitments of volume as established in the customer’s contract, with orders less than committed volume resulting in additional costs per wind blade to customers. Orders in excess of annual commitments may but generally do not result in discounts to customers from the contracted price for the committed volume. Customers may utilize early payment discounts, which are reported as a reduction of revenue at the time the discount is taken.
Vestas
In 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Vestas to supply wind blades from our manufacturing facility in Dafeng, China. Based on the success of this manufacturing arrangement, we expanded our relationship with Vestas through additional supply agreements to manufacture wind blades at our manufacturing facilities in Turkey, Matamoros, Mexico, Yangzhou, China and Chennai, India. In December 2021, we extended our supply agreement with Vestas at one of our Izmir, Turkey plants for an additional year through December 2023. We consolidated our manufacturing footprint for Vestas in China at the end of 2021 by stopping production at our Dafeng, China facility and agreeing to add four new manufacturing lines to our Yangzhou, China manufacturing facility. Each of the supply agreements with Vestas provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by Vestas each year during the term, the schedule for which is established at the outset of the agreement. In return, we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to Vestas for each of the years under the supply agreements. Additionally, we have manufactured some of the model-specific tooling that we use to produce wind blades for Vestas. If either party commits a material breach of the supply agreement, the non-breaching party may terminate the supply agreement if the breach is not remedied or if the parties have not mutually agreed to plan for cure within 30 days after notice of breach has been given.
GE Wind
We have multiple supply agreements with GE Wind to manufacture wind blades from two manufacturing facilities in Juárez, Mexico. Each of the supply agreements with GE Wind provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by GE Wind each year during the term, the schedule for which is established at the outset of the agreement. In return, we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to GE Wind for each of the years under the supply agreements. In August 2018, GE Wind agreed to extend our existing supply agreement for one of our Mexico manufacturing facilities by two years to 2022 and increased the number of wind blade manufacturing lines in that facility from three to five. In July 2020, GE Wind agreed to extend our existing supply agreement in one of our Mexico plants by two years to 2022 and added one additional wind blade manufacturing line in Mexico to provide blades for GE Wind’s turbine technologies in North America in 2021. We ceased production of GE Wind blades at our Iowa facility during the fourth quarter of 2021. Unless otherwise terminated or renewed, our supply agreements with GE Wind in Mexico are in effect until the end of 2022. In addition, either party may terminate these supply agreements upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured for 30 days after written notice has been provided.
 Nordex
We supply wind blades to Nordex from our manufacturing facilities in Turkey, India and Matamoros, Mexico. In Matamoros, we took over a facility from Nordex, pursuant to a 3-year supply agreement. If the supply agreement for the Matamoros manufacturing facility is not extended, then Nordex will resume management and operation of the Matamoros wind blade manufacturing facility at the end of the 3-year term. Each of the supply agreements with Nordex provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by Nordex each year during the term, and we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to Nordex for each of the years under the supply agreements.
Other Supply Agreements
 We have a supply agreement in Turkey with ENERCON. With respect to this supply agreement, we have agreed to dedicate capacity for a set number of wind blades for each calendar year during the term of the agreement in exchange for a commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets. Unless otherwise terminated, this supply agreement remains in effect for a period of several years and either party may terminate the supply agreement upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured. This supply agreement contains provisions that allow for our customer to purchase less volume in later years of this supply agreement, reduce the number of dedicated manufacturing lines or to terminate the supply agreement upon notice for reasons such as our failure to deliver the contracted wind blade volumes or our failure to meet certain mutually agreed upon cost reduction targets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Wind Blade Business— Some of our supply agreements with our customers are subject to early termination and volume reductions at the discretion of our customers, and any early termination of or reduced volumes of wind blades purchased under these agreements would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development
 We have a long history of developing composite products as well as the development of new and advanced materials, tooling, manufacturing processes and inspection methods. Our knowledge and experience of composite materials and manufacturing originates with our predecessor company, Tillotson Pearson Inc., a leading manufacturer of high-performance recreational sail and powerboats along with a wide range of composite structures used in other industrial applications. Leveraging our knowledge and experience, we realized the opportunity to specialize in wind energy and other industrial end-markets where there was a demand for high precision composite manufacturing capabilities.
 We conduct research and development in close collaboration with our customers on the design, development, and deployment of innovative manufacturing processes, including automation, advanced materials and sophisticated product quality inspection tools. We have partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), government laboratories, universities and our customers to innovate through cost sharing of advanced manufacturing and other innovative programs. In 2021, we began a collaboration with the University of Maine pursuant to a grant from the U.S. DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office to develop a rapid, low-cost additive manufacturing solution (3D printing) for fabricating large, segmented wind blade molds. Additionally, we participate on collaborative programs as a working member of the Institute for Advanced Composite Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI), a US DOE National Network of Manufacturing Innovation consortium. Specifically, this effort includes new material systems focused on creating an economical solution to end-of-life reclamation of materials for reuse and recycling. This work includes cost sharing of engineering and laboratory support to develop new process technologies.
 We employ a highly experienced workforce of engineers in various facets of our business, from research and development projects, to the ongoing, real-time development and implementation of incremental manufacturing and material improvements. Our research and development effort places a priority on improving quality through process and procedure improvement, in addition to reducing cost through specification changes and sourcing of more cost-effective suppliers. Other areas of emphasis include composite design, in-house fabrication of precision molding and assembly systems, prototyping, testing, optimization and volume production capabilities. We also encourage our employees to invent and develop new technologies to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. In addition to our internal research and development activities, from time to time, we also conduct research and development activities pursuant to funded development arrangements with our customers and other third parties, and intend to continue to seek opportunities for product development programs that could create recurring revenue and increase our overall profitability over the long term.
 In July 2019, we acquired certain IP and hired a team of engineering resources from the EUROS group, based in Berlin, Germany. This team of technical experts focuses on blade design, tooling, materials and process technology development. This acquisition strengthened our technical capabilities in support of our global operations and growth. In addition, we established an advanced engineering center in Kolding, Denmark which provides technical and engineering resources to our manufacturing facilities and our customers.

Competition
 The wind blade market is highly concentrated, competitive and subject to evolving customer needs and expectations. Our competitors include LM Wind Power (a subsidiary of GE Renewable Energy) and other independent wind blade manufacturers such as Sinoma Science & Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai Aeolon Wind Energy Technology Development (Group) Co., Ltd., Aeris Industria E Comercio De Equipamentos Para Geracao De Energia S.A. and ZhongFu Lianzhong Composites Group Co., Ltd., as well as regional wind blade suppliers in geographic areas where our current or prospective manufacturing facilities are located.
We also compete with, and in a number of cases supplement, vertically integrated wind turbine OEMs that manufacture their wind blades.
 The principal competitive factors in the wind blade market include reliability, total delivered cost, manufacturing capability, product quality, engineering capability and timely completion of wind blades. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the foregoing factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of manufacturing capability, timely completion and product quality.
 Competitive advantages in the wind blade service market include speed of response, local footprint, repair quality, competitive labor pricing and capacity to work across regions as demand adapts to the business seasonality. Our competitors include certain of our wind OEM customers, and a broad range of independent wind blade service companies. We have proven strong in many of these criteria and our ability to remain competitive will depend on such factors, including strengthening our response time, adding and managing labor resources, sourcing materials globally at competitive rates while further expanding into new countries, and offering additional value-added engineering support and technical solutions.
 The transportation and automotive supply industry is highly competitive, and our composite solutions compete against alternative materials and a broad range of competitive suppliers. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on time to market, continuing to provide a lower upfront investment for our customers, and providing superior performance attributes with our composite solutions.
 Transportation Products
 We seek to create additional recurring revenue opportunities through the supply of other composite structures outside the wind energy market. We believe transportation products, including buses, trucks, electric vehicles and high-performance automotive products and components, are ideally suited for our advanced composite technology because of the benefits derived from weight reduction, corrosion resistance, strength, durability and lower upfront capital costs. These benefits should allow us to develop structural composite solutions to assist our customers in developing electric vehicles, including light, medium and heavy-duty trucks, buses and automobiles with clean propulsion systems or in meeting new and developing fuel economy standards.
In addition, by producing a range of composite structures, we are able to leverage the materials and manufacturing process technology and expertise developed through one project to maximize production quality, improve performance and minimize costs across our other manufacturing efforts, including our wind blade business. Our projects for customers in the transportation market have historically generated project-related revenues for a specific duration. We intend to seek collaborations with additional customers in these markets that will provide recurring revenue and business opportunities for us, in addition to the opportunities provided by our existing customers and relationships, and contribute to our overall profitability over the long term.
Our facilities in Warren, Rhode Island and Juárez, Mexico manufacture products for customers in the transportation market using, in some cases, similar proprietary and replicable manufacturing processes that we use to produce wind blades. Our projects for customers in the transportation market include, or have included, the supply of all-composite bodies for electric buses and last-mile delivery as well as automated people mover systems for airports. In November 2017, we signed a five-year supply agreement with Proterra to supply Proterra Catalyst® composite bus bodies. In June 2021, we extended our supply agreement with Proterra through December 2024.


In 2019, we made a capital investment of approximately $11.5 million to develop a highly automated manufacturing line for the electric vehicle market within our Warren, Rhode Island facility to enable us to further develop our technology, create defensible product and process IP and demonstrate our capability to manufacture composite components cost effectively at automotive volume rates. In 2021, we began a production program to manufacture a composite component for an electric vehicle manufacturer using this automated production line and have commenced production of additional components for this manufacturer in 2022. We manufactured approximately 26,000 production components in 2021 and anticipate manufacturing an additional 25,000 production components in the first half of 2022. We continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities and have received orders with a major OEM to produce approximately 450,000 production components in 2022 and approximately 1,000,000 in 2023.
 Our current principal competitors in the transportation market include suppliers of conventional steel and aluminum products and non-structural automotive fiberglass and other advanced composites-based manufacturers for transportation applications.
 Intellectual Property
 We have a variety of IP rights, including trademarks, copyrights and patents issued, filed and applied-for in a number of jurisdictions, including the U.S., Germany, the European Union and China, trademarks and copyrights, but we believe that our continued success and competitive position depend, in large part, on our proprietary materials, tooling, process and inspection technologies and our ability to innovate and not on our IP alone. Accordingly, we take measures to protect the confidentiality and control the disclosure of our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, know-how and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary rights and preserve our competitive position. We also seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our customers, employees, consultants and other contractors. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our customers, employees, consultants or contractors use IP owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Backlog
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our backlog for wind blades and related wind products totaled $813.1 million and $1,197.7 million, respectively. Our backlog includes purchase orders issued in connection with our supply agreements. We generally record a purchase order into backlog when the following requirements have been met: a signed supply agreement or other contractual agreement has been executed with our customer, a purchase order has been issued by our customer and we expect to ship wind blades to or produce the related wind products for such customer in satisfaction of any purchase order within 12 months. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenue for any future period.
Regulation
 Wind Energy
 Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local regulations related to environmental protection, health and safety, labor relationships, general business practices and other matters. These regulations are administered by various foreign, federal, state and local environmental agencies and authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and comparable agencies in China, Mexico, Turkey, India and individual U.S. states. In addition, our manufacturing operations in China, Mexico, Turkey and India are subject to those countries’ wage and price controls, currency exchange control regulations, investment and tax laws, laws restricting our ability to repatriate profits, trade restrictions and laws that may restrict foreign investment in certain industries. Some of these laws have only been recently adopted or are subject to further rulemaking or interpretation, and their impact on our operations, including the cost of complying with these laws, is uncertain. We believe that our operations currently comply, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations. Further, as a U.S. corporation, we are subject to The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their

intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. As a U.S. corporation with global operations, we are also subject to foreign antibribery laws and regulations in the countries where we conduct business, including the U.K. Bribery Act.
 In addition, our business has been and will continue to be affected by subsidization of the wind turbine industry with its influence declining over time as wind energy reaches grid parity with traditional sources of energy. In the U.S., the federal government has encouraged capital investment in renewable energy primarily through tax incentives. Production tax credits for new renewable energy projects were first established in 1992. The Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy (PTC) provided the owner of a wind turbine placed in operation before January 1, 2015 with a 10-year credit against its U.S. federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine.
 The PTC was extended in 2015 for wind power projects through December 31, 2019, and was to be phased down over the term of the PTC extension. Specifically, the PTC was kept at the same rate in effect at the end of 2014 for wind power projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2016, and thereafter was to be reduced by 20% per year in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In December 2019, Congress extended the PTC through the end of 2020 and increased the rate from 40% to 60% for projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2020 and are commissioned by the end of 2024. In December 2020, Congress extended the PTC through the end of 2021, continuing the rate of 60% for projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2021 and are commissioned by the end of 2025. Although we believe that the onshore wind market will continue to grow over the long term, the expiration of the PTC at the end of 2021 has created uncertainty in the near term resulting in decreased demand for our wind blades in 2021 compared to 2020. We are monitoring legislative and regulatory policy proposals to extend or expand tax credits in the U.S. to promote wind energy.
 At the state level, as of December 31, 2021, 30 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have implemented renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs that generally require that, by a specified date, a certain percentage of a utility’s electricity supplied to consumers within such state is to be from renewable sources (ranging from 10% to 100% and from between the present and 2050).
 In addition, there are also increasing regulatory efforts globally to promote renewable power. In December 2020, the European Union (EU) agreed to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Similarly, in December 2020, China announced its goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and in November 2021, India targeted to increase its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2070. Additionally, Turkey enacted Law No. 5346 in 2005, which was recently amended and extended in January 2021, to promote renewable-based electricity generation within their domestic electricity market through feed-in- tariffs and purchase obligations for distribution companies requiring purchases from certified renewable energy producers.
 Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 14,000 full-time employees, approximately 600 of whom were located in the U.S., 1,400 in China, 6,300 in Mexico, 4,100 in Turkey and 1,600 in India. Certain of our employees in Turkey and at our manufacturing facilities in Matamoros, Mexico are represented by labor unions. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
Our human capital strategy focuses on creating an exceptional employee experience and ensuring that we foster a learning culture where our employees want to grow with us. Our primary focus areas of our human capital strategy are as follows:
Culture
 We believe our unique culture is a key strategic advantage for us. Our associates are highly engaged and committed to the Company, their teams, and the jobs they perform based on our most recent employee engagement surveys. This strong employee engagement is due in part to a strong sense of purpose given our role in the broader

renewable energy supply chain. We believe strong employee engagement translates into a strong quality focus and orientation. It is through the efforts of our approximately 14,000 employees at year-end 2021 that we have been able to continue to achieve high levels of performance. When we select new persons to join our team, we ensure that the individuals have high levels of commitment and adaptability in addition to the skills needed for the role. Our employees embrace our core values of safety, operational excellence, commitment, integrity and leadership. Our team members bring our values to life by applying their diverse backgrounds and skillsets to the jobs they are performing, demonstrating high discretionary effort, and embracing our values in their day-to-day lives.
Safety
  Safety is our most important and first core value. We strongly believe that all accidents are preventable and that every associate should return at the end of their shift to their families in the same healthy condition in which they showed up for work. To help drive these beliefs it is our goal to continuously improve our zero-harm culture and implement a global behavior-based safety (BBS) program resulting in zero unsafe behaviors. All of our manufacturing facilities have safety management systems in place that cover their associates and activities. We ensure the safety of our associates to support our zero-harm culture in a variety of ways, starting with safety education. Safety education is the foundation for our other safety measures. Associates receive regular training on environmental, health and safety (EHS) related topics. This training includes but is not limited to:
 
•general awareness EHS training
 •ergonomics training
 •compliance training
 •hazard-specific training as required for the job or task
 •fire hazard and prevention training
 •hazardous material training
 •equipment-specific safety training
 •safety incident and corrective action training
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We value diversity in all forms, especially diversity of thought, and aspire to create an environment that recognizes and celebrates the benefits that come with a diverse workforce. We know that diversity of our employee population makes us better and strive to continue to improve and act with intention in these areas.
As a global business, we have an incredible opportunity to benefit from the diversity we have in our Company. We can and will do more to maximize the positive impact that diversity, equity, inclusion, and a feeling of belonging can bring. We believe that this and the rest of our vision statement for diversity, equity and inclusion is a solid representation of what we believe in, are committed to, and how we will hold associates and leaders accountable. We recognize that one of our greatest areas of opportunity is to increase the representation of women and overall racial and ethnic diversity at all levels of leadership as we add more talent to our leadership levels.
Talent
 We market open jobs across multiple platforms such as our website, LinkedIn, internal postings and local job boards to ensure that our candidate pool is as diverse as possible. We promote having diversity on the interviewing and selection panel to ensure different points of view are considered as part of the final selection process. We enjoy high levels of retention across all of our geographies. Our overall turnover rate has continued to decline over the past three years on a global basis. We facilitate an annual talent review process in all regions and functional teams to promote the internal development and promotion of internal talent. We have enjoyed high participation in employee surveys, high engagement levels against industry normative data, and also facilitated a COVID-19 and diversity equity and inclusion survey in 2021.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate governing, among other things, health, safety, pollution and protection of the

environment and natural resources, the handling and use of hazardous substances, the generation, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, and the cleanup of any contaminated sites. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. However, failure by us to comply with applicable environmental and other requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, remediation actions, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We have adopted environmental, health and safety policies outlining our commitment to environmental responsibility and accountability and our desire to eliminate unsafe behaviors in the workplace. These policies apply to the Company as a whole, and our vendors and suppliers and are available on our website. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented a number of measures to promote workplace safety. Customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions due to increased regulations to report all incidents that occur at their sites and the costs associated with such incidents.
