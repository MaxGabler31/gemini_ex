ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

OVERVIEW
 Background
 We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in April 2004 to own and operate the assets and businesses previously owned and operated by Cornerstone Family Services, Inc., ("Cornerstone"), which was converted into CFSI LLC, a limited liability company ("CFSI"), prior to our initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests on September 20, 2004. On May 21, 2014, Cornerstone Family Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CFS"), and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, CFSI LLC and StoneMor GP LLC, our general partner ("StoneMor GP" or "general partner"), completed a series of transactions (the "Reorganization") to streamline the ownership structure of CFSI and StoneMor GP. As a result of the Reorganization, StoneMor GP became a 100% owned subsidiary of StoneMor GP Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("GP Holdings"), formerly known as CFSI, and GP Holdings is owned by (i) a trustee of the trust established for the pecuniary benefit of American Cemeteries Infrastructure Investors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("ACII"), which trustee has exclusive voting and investment power over approximately 89.01% of the membership interests in GP Holdings, and (ii) certain directors, affiliates of certain directors and current and former executive officers of our general partner. See Part III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of the Reorganization. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we," "us," "our," "StoneMor," the "Company," or the "Partnership" are to StoneMor Partners L.P. and its subsidiaries.
 This is the first Annual Report on Form 10-K we are filing as a smaller reporting company within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1034, as amended.  As a smaller reporting company, we may choose to comply with certain scaled or non-scaled financial and non-financial disclosure requirements on an item by item basis.
 Proposed Merger and Reorganization
 On September 27, 2018, the Partnership, StoneMor GP, StoneMor GP Holdings LLC and Hans Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of StoneMor GP (“Merger Sub”), entered into a Merger and Reorganization Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, GP will convert from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation to be named StoneMor Inc. (the “Company” when referring to StoneMor Inc. subsequent to such conversion), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (the “Merger”), with the Partnership surviving and with the Company as its sole general partner, the Partnership will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the unitholders of the Partnership will become stockholders in the Company.
 The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, without limitation: (a) approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Units, (b) there being no law or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (c) subject to specified materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, (d) compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective covenants, (e) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4, (f) the approval for listing of the Company shares to be issued in the Merger on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange and (g) the Company’s assumption of a long-term incentive plan as specified in the Merger Agreement.
 See “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—"There can be no assurance that the proposed C-Corporation Conversion will be approved and ultimately consummated or that the anticipated benefits of any such transactions will be realized;” and “If the C-Corporation Conversion does not occur, we will not benefit from the expenses we have incurred in the pursuit of the C-Corporation Conversion” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Products and Service Offerings
 We are currently the second largest owner and operator of cemeteries and funeral homes in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 322 cemeteries in 27 states and Puerto Rico. We own 291 of these cemeteries and we manage or operate the remaining 31 under lease, management or operating agreements with the nonprofit cemetery companies that own the cemeteries. As of December 31, 2018, we also owned, operated or managed 90 funeral homes, including 42 located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own, in 17 states and Puerto Rico.

The cemetery products and services that we sell include the following:
 
 
Interment Rights | Merchandise | Services 
----------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
burial lots | burial vaults | installation of burial vaults 
lawn crypts | caskets | installation of caskets 
mausoleum crypts | grave markers and grave marker bases | installation of other cemetery merchandise
cremation niches | memorials | other service items 
perpetual care rights | | 

 
We sell these products and services both at the time of death, which we refer to as at-need, and prior to the time of death, which we refer to as pre-need. Our sales of real property, including burial lots (with and without installed vaults), lawn and mausoleum crypts and cremation niches, generally generate qualifying income sufficient for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. In 2018, we performed 54,773 burials and sold 30,063 interment rights (net of cancellations). Based on our sales of interment spaces in 2018, our cemeteries have an aggregate average remaining sales life of 223 years.
 Our cemetery properties are located in Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Our cemetery operations accounted for approximately 83% and 82% of our revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Our primary funeral home products are caskets and related items. Our funeral home services include family consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, insurance products and the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and prayer services.
 Our funeral homes are located in Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Our funeral home operations accounted for approximately 17% and 18% of our consolidated revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our funeral home operations are conducted through various 100% owned subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 OPERATIONS
 Segment Reporting and Related Information
 We have two distinct reportable segments, which are classified as Cemetery Operations and Funeral Home Operations segments, both of which are supported by corporate costs and expenses.
 We have chosen this level of organization and disaggregation of reportable segments because: (a) each reportable segment has unique characteristics that set it apart from the other segment; (b) we have organized our management personnel at these two operational levels; and (c) it is the level at which our chief decision makers evaluates performance.
 Cemetery Operations
 As of December 31, 2018, we operated 322 cemeteries. Our Cemetery Operations include sales of cemetery interment rights, merchandise and services and the performance of cemetery maintenance and other services. An interment right entitles a customer to a burial space in one of our cemeteries and the perpetual care of that burial space. Burial spaces, or lots, are parcels of property that hold interred human remains. Our cemeteries require a burial vault to be placed in each burial lot. A burial vault is a rectangular container, usually made of concrete but also made of steel or plastic, which sits in the burial lot and in which the casket is placed. The top of the burial vault is buried approximately 18 to 24 inches below the surface of the ground, and the casket is placed inside the vault. Burial vaults prevent ground settling that may create uneven ground surfaces. Ground settling typically results in higher maintenance costs and potential exposure for accidents on the property. Lawn crypts are a series of closely spaced burial lots with preinstalled vaults and may include other improvements, such as landscaping, sprinkler systems and drainage. A mausoleum crypt is an above ground structure that may be designed for a particular customer, which we refer to as a private mausoleum, or it may be a larger building that serves multiple customers, which we refer to as a community mausoleum. Cremation niches are spaces in which the ashes remaining after cremation are stored. Cremation niches are often part of community mausoleums, although we sell a variety of cremation niches to accommodate our customers’ preferences.
 Grave markers, monuments and memorials are above ground products that serve as memorials by showing who is remembered, the dates of birth and death and other pertinent information. These markers, monuments and memorials include simple plates, such as those used in a community mausoleum or cremation niche, flush-to-the-ground granite or bronze markers, headstones or large stone obelisks.

One of the principal services we provide at our cemeteries is an "opening and closing," which is the digging and refilling of burial spaces to install the vault and place the casket into the vault. With pre-need sales, there are usually two openings and closings, where permitted by applicable law. During the initial opening and closing, we install the burial vault in the burial space. Where permitted by applicable law, we usually perform this service shortly after the customer signs a pre-need contract. Advance installation allows us to withdraw the related funds from our merchandise trusts, making the amount in excess of our cost to purchase and install the vault available to us for other uses, and eliminates future merchandise trusting requirements for the burial vault and its installation. During the final opening and closing, we remove the dirt above the vault, open the lid of the vault, place the casket into the vault, close the vault lid and replace the ground cover. With at-need sales, we typically perform the initial opening and closing at the time we perform the final opening and closing. Our other services include the installation of other cemetery merchandise and the perpetual care related to interment rights.
 Funeral Home Operations
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned, operated or managed 90 funeral homes, 42 of which are located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own. Our funeral homes offer a range of services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including family consultation, final expense insurance products, the removal and preparation of remains, provision of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation, worship and performance of funeral services and transportation services. Funeral Home Operations primarily generate revenues from at-need sales.
Cremation Products and Services
 We operate crematories at some of our cemeteries or funeral homes, but our primary crematory operations are sales of receptacles for cremated remains, such as urns, and the inurnment of cremated remains in niches or scattering gardens. While cremation products and services usually cost less than traditional burial products and services and take up less space than burials. We sell cremation products and services on both a pre-need and an at-need basis.
Seasonality
 Although the death care business is relatively stable and predictable, our results of operations may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in deaths due to weather conditions and illness. We generally perform fewer initial openings and closings in the winter when the ground is frozen in many of the areas in which we operate. We may also experience declines in contracts written during the winter months due to inclement weather, which makes it more difficult for our sales staff to meet with customers.
Sales Contracts
 Pre-need products and services are typically sold on an installment basis. At-need products and services are generally required to be paid for in full in cash by the customer at the time of sale. As a result of our pre-need sales, the backlog of unfulfilled pre-need performance obligations recorded in deferred revenues was $914.3 million and $912.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Trusts
 Sales of cemetery products and services are subject to a variety of state regulations. In accordance with these regulations, we are required to establish and fund two types of trusts, merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts, to ensure that we can meet our future obligations. Our funding obligations are generally equal to a percentage of the sales proceeds or costs of the products and services we sell.
Sales Personnel, Training and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 716 full-time commissioned salespeople 7 part-time commissioned salespeople and salaried sales managers and 25 full-time sales support and telemarketing employees. We had five regional sales vice presidents supporting our Cemetery Operations who report to the Chief Operating Officer.  The regional sales vice presidents have dotted lines reporting to our National Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Individual salespersons are typically located at the cemeteries they serve and report directly to the cemetery sales manager. We have made a commitment to the ongoing education and training of our sales force and to salesperson retention in order to provide our customers high quality customer service and in an effort to comply with all applicable laws and requirements. Our training program includes classroom training at regional training locations, field training, periodically updated training materials that utilize media, such as web based modules, for interactive training and participation in industry seminars. We place special emphasis on training property sales managers, who are key elements to a successful pre-need sales program.
 We reward our salespeople with incentives for attaining certain sales volume. Sales force performance is evaluated by sales budgets, sales mix and closing ratios, which are equal to the number of contracts written divided by the number of presentations that are made. Substantially all of our sales force is compensated based solely on performance. Commissions are augmented with various bonus and incentive packages in an effort to attract and retain a high quality, motivated sales force. We pay commissions 
 5


to our sales personnel on pre-need contracts based upon a percentage of the value of the underlying contracts. Such commissions vary depending upon the type of interment right, merchandise and services sold. We also pay commissions on at-need contracts that are generally based upon a variable percentage based upon products selected on the contract.  In addition, some cemetery managers receive an override commission that is equal to a percentage of the gross sales price of the contracts entered into by the salespeople assigned to the cemeteries they manage. All new sales managers that are hired are paid a salary plus a monthly bonus for reaching revenue targets.
 We generate sales leads through digital marketing, direct mail, websites, funeral follow-up and sales force cold calling, with the assistance of database mining and other marketing resources. We have created a marketing department to allow us to use more sophisticated marketing techniques to focus more effectively our lead generation and direct sales efforts. Sales leads are referred to the sales force to schedule an appointment, either at the customer’s home or at the cemetery location.
 Acquisitions
 On January 19, 2018, the Partnership acquired six cemetery properties in Wisconsin and their related assets, net of certain assumed liabilities, for cash consideration of $2.5 million, of which $0.8 million was paid at closing. These properties had been managed by the Partnership since August 2016. The Partnership has accounted for the purchase of these properties, which were not material individually or in the aggregate, under the acquisition method of accounting.  The Partnership did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Competition
 Our cemeteries and funeral homes generally serve customers that live within a 10 to 15-mile radius of a property’s location. We face competition from other cemeteries and funeral homes located within this localized area. Most of these cemeteries and funeral homes are independently owned and operated, and most of these owners and operators are smaller than we are and have fewer resources than we do. We generally face limited competition from the two larger publicly held death care companies that have U.S. operations — Service Corporation International and Carriage Services, Inc. — as they do not directly operate cemeteries in the same local geographic areas where we operate.
 Within a localized area of competition, we compete primarily for at-need sales because, in general, many of the independently owned, local competitors may not have pre-need sales programs. Most of these competitors do not have as many of the resources that are available to us to launch and grow a substantial pre-need sales program. The number of customers that cemeteries and funeral homes are able to attract is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important factors. The sale of cemetery and funeral home products and services on a pre-need basis has increasingly been used by many companies as an important marketing tool. Due to the importance of reputation and heritage, increases in customer base are usually gained over a long period of time.
 Competitors within a localized area have an advantage over us if a potential customer’s family members are already buried in the competitor’s cemetery. If either of the two publicly held death care companies identified above operated, or in the future were to operate, cemeteries within close proximity of our cemeteries, they may offer more competition than independent cemeteries and may have a competitive advantage over us to the extent they have greater financial resources available to them due to their size and access to the capital markets.
 We believe that we currently face limited competition for cemetery acquisitions. The two publicly held death care companies identified above, as well as Stewart Enterprises, Inc., which was acquired by Service Corporation International in December 2013, have historically been the industry’s primary consolidators, but have largely curtailed cemetery acquisition activity since 1999. Furthermore, these companies continue to generate the majority of their revenues from funeral home operations. Based on the relative levels of cemetery and funeral home operations of these publicly traded death care companies, which are disclosed in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we believe that we are the only publicly held death care company that focuses a significant portion of its efforts on Cemetery Operations.
 REGULATION
 Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under federal, state and local laws, which impacts the goods and services that we may sell and the manner in which we may furnish goods and services.
 Cooling-Off Legislation
 Each of the states where our current cemetery and funeral home properties are located has "cooling-off" legislation with respect to pre-need sales of cemetery and funeral home products and services. This legislation generally requires us to refund proceeds from pre-need sales contracts if canceled by the customer for any reason within three to thirty days from the date of the contract, depending on the state (and some states permit cancellation and require refund beyond thirty days) including until death. The 
 6


Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") also requires a cooling-off period of three business days for door to door sales, during which time a contract may be cancelled entitling a customer to a refund of the funds paid.
 Trusting
 Sales of cemetery interment rights and pre-need sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services are generally subject to trusting requirements imposed by state laws in most of the states where we operate. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1, Note 7 and Note 8 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion regarding trusting.
Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z
 Our pre-need installment contracts are subject to the federal Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA") and the regulations thereunder, which are referred to as Regulation Z. TILA and Regulation Z promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring us to disclose, among other things, the annual percentage rate, finance charges and amount financed when extending credit to consumers.
Other Consumer Credit-Related Laws and Regulations
 As a provider of consumer credit and a business that generally deals with consumers, we are subject to various other state and federal laws covering matters such as credit discrimination, the use of credit reports, identity theft, the handling of consumer information, consumer privacy, marketing and advertising, debt collection, extensions of credit to service members and prohibitions on unfair or deceptive trade practices.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank")
 Dodd-Frank created the new federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the "Bureau"). In addition to transferring to the Bureau rule-writing authority for nearly all federal consumer finance-related laws and giving the Bureau rule-writing authority in other areas, Dodd-Frank empowered the Bureau to conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions against certain consumer credit providers and other entities offering consumer financial products or services. While not presently subject to examination by the Bureau, we potentially could be in the future in connection with our pre-need installment contracts. The Bureau also has authority to conduct investigations and bring enforcement actions against providers of consumer financial services, including providers over which it may not currently have examination authority. The Bureau may seek penalties and other relief on behalf of consumers that are substantially in excess of the remedies available under such laws prior to Dodd-Frank. The Bureau has officially assumed rule-writing and enforcement authority for most federal consumer finance laws, as well as the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive practices related to consumer financial products and services.
Telemarketing Laws
 We are subject to the requirements of two federal statutes governing telemarketing practices, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA") and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act ("TCFAPA"). These statutes impose significant penalties on those who fail to comply with their mandates. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), is the federal agency with authority to enforce the TCPA, and the FTC has jurisdiction under the TCFAPA. The FTC and FCC jointly administer a national "do not call" registry, which consumers can join in order to prevent unwanted telemarketing calls. Primarily as a result of implementation of the "do not call" legislation and regulations, the percentage of our pre-need sales generated from telemarketing leads has decreased substantially in the past ten years. We are also subject to similar telemarketing consumer protection laws in all states in which we currently operate. These states’ statutes similarly permit consumers to prevent unwanted telephone solicitations. In addition, in cases where telephone solicitations are permitted, there are various restrictions and requirements under state and federal law in connection with such calls.
Occupational Safety and Health Act and Related Environmental Law Requirements
 We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. OSHA’s regulatory requirement, known as the Hazard Communication Standard, and similar state statutes require us to provide information and training to our employees about hazardous materials used or maintained for our operations. We may also be subject to Tier 1 or Tier 2 Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act ("EPCRA"), depending on the amount of hazardous materials maintained on-site at a particular facility (requiring reporting to federal, state and local authorities). We are also subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws, which, among other things, may require that we modify our facilities to comply with minimum accessibility requirements for disabled persons.
 7


Federal Trade Commission
 Our funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the FTC under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral home industry promulgated thereunder, referred to as the "Funeral Rule." The Funeral Rule requires funeral service providers to disclose the prices for their goods and services as soon as the subject of price arises in a discussion with a potential customer (this entails presenting various itemized price lists if the consultation is in person, and readily answering all price-related questions posed over the telephone), and to offer their goods and services on an unbundled basis. The Funeral Rule also prohibits misrepresentations in connection with our sale of goods and services, and requires that the consumer receive an itemized statement of the goods and services purchased. Through these regulations, the FTC sought to give consumers the ability to compare prices among funeral service providers and to avoid buying packages containing goods or services that they did not want. The unbundling of goods from services has also opened the way for third-party, discount casket sellers to enter the market, although they currently do not possess substantial market share.
 In addition, our pre-need installment contracts for sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services are subject to the FTC’s "Holder Rule," which requires disclosure in the installment contract that any holder of the contract is subject to all claims and defenses that the consumer could assert against the seller of the goods or services, subject to certain limitations. These contracts are also subject to the FTC’s "Credit Practices Rule," which prohibits certain credit loan terms and practices.
 Future Enactments and Regulation
 Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws, rules and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations which, if enacted or adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general. A significant portion of our operations is located in California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, Florida, West Virginia and Wisconsin and any material adverse change in the regulatory requirements of those states applicable to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulations or the effect that any such legislation or regulations, if enacted or adopted, might have on us.
Environmental Regulations and Liabilities
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations in three principal areas: (1) crematories for emissions to air that may trigger requirements under the Clean Air Act; (2) funeral homes for the management of hazardous materials and medical wastes; and (3) cemeteries and funeral homes for the management of solid waste, underground and above ground storage tanks and discharges to wastewater treatment systems and/or septic systems.
Clean Air Act
 The Federal Clean Air Act and similar state laws, which regulate emissions into the air, can affect crematory operations through permitting and emissions control requirements. Our crematory operations may be subject to Clean Air Act regulations under federal and state law and may be subject to enforcement actions if these operations do not conform to the requirements of these laws.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
 As noted above, federal, state and local regulations apply to the storage and use of hazardous materials at our facilities. Depending on the types and quantities of materials we manage at any particular facility, we may be required to maintain and submit Material Safety Data Sheets and inventories of these materials to the regulatory authorities in compliance with EPCRA or similar state and local laws.
Clean Water Act
 We are also subject to the Clean Water Act and corresponding state laws, as well as local requirements applicable to the treatment of sanitary and industrial wastewaters. Many of our funeral homes discharge their wastewaters into publicly operated treatment works, and may be subject to applicable limits as to contaminants that may be included in the discharge of their wastewater. Our cemeteries typically discharge their wastewaters from sanitary use and maintenance operations conducted onsite into septic systems, which are regulated under state and local laws. If there are violations of applicable local, state or federal laws pertaining to our discharges of wastewaters, we may be subject to penalties as well as an obligation to make operational changes or conduct required remediation.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state laws affect our cemetery and funeral home operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and remediation obligations for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or welfare or the 
 8


environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed upon generators, site owners and operators and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Our operations include the use and off-site disposal of some materials that may meet the definition of "hazardous substances" under CERCLA or state laws and thus may give rise to liability if released to the environment through a spill or other release at our facilities. Should we acquire new properties with pre-existing conditions triggering CERCLA or similar state liability, we may become liable for responding to those conditions under CERCLA or similar state laws. We may become involved in proceedings, litigation or investigations at one or more sites where releases of hazardous substances have occurred, and we cannot assure you that the associated costs and potential liabilities would not be material.
 Underground and Above Ground Storage Tank Laws and Solid Waste Laws
 Federal, state and local laws regulate the installation, removal, operations and closure of underground storage tanks ("USTs"), and above ground storage tanks ("ASTs"), which are located at some of our facilities, as well as the management and disposal of solid waste. Most of the USTs and ASTs contain petroleum for heating our buildings or are used for vehicle maintenance or general operations. Depending upon the age and integrity of the USTs and ASTs, they may require upgrades, removal and/or closure, and remediation may be required if there has been a discharge or release into the environment. All of the aforementioned activities may require us to incur capital costs and expenses to ensure continued compliance with environmental requirements. Should we acquire properties with existing USTs and ASTs that are not in compliance with environmental law requirements, we may become liable for responding to releases to the environment or for costs associated with upgrades, removal and/or closure costs, and we cannot assure you that the costs or liabilities will not be material in that event. Solid wastes have been disposed of at some of our cemeteries, both lawfully and unlawfully. Prior to acquiring a cemetery, an environmental site assessment is usually conducted to determine, among other conditions, if a solid waste disposal area or landfill exists on the parcel which requires removal, cleanup or management. Depending upon the nature and extent of any such solid waste disposal areas, we may be required by applicable environmental law or the applicable regulatory authority to remove the waste materials or to conduct remediation and we cannot assure you that the costs or liabilities will not be material in that event.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, our general partner and its affiliates employed 2,630 full-time, 301 part-time and 21 seasonal employees. Fifty-three of these employees are represented by various unions in Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, New Jersey and Illinois, and are subject to collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging from September 2020 to May 2023. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally favorable.
