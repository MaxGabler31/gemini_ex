ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Overview
Wabash National Corporation, which we refer to herein as “Wabash,” the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our,” is Changing How the World Reaches YouTM. Wabash was founded in 1985 and incorporated as a corporation in Delaware in 1991, with its principal executive offices in Lafayette, Indiana, as a dry van trailer manufacturer. Today we are an innovation leader of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries.
To that end, we design and manufacture a diverse range of products, including dry freight and refrigerated trailers, platform trailers, tank trailers, dry and refrigerated truck bodies, structural composite panels and products, transportation, logistics, and distribution industry parts and services, and specialty food grade processing equipment. We have achieved this diversification through acquisitions, organic growth, and product innovation.
We believe our position as a leader in our key industries is the result of longstanding relationships with our core customers, our demonstrated ability to attract new customers, our broad and innovative product lines, our engineering leadership, and our extensive distribution and service network. More importantly, we believe our leadership position is indicative of the Values and Leadership Principles that guide our actions.
At Wabash, it’s our focus on people, purpose, and performance that drives us to do better. Our Purpose is to change how the world reaches you; our Vision is to be the innovation leader of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries; and our Mission is to enable our customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that help them move everything from first to final mile.
Our Values are the qualities that govern our critical leadership behaviors and accelerate our progress.

▪Have a Growth Mindset: We will be resilient and capable of the change required to succeed in a world that does not stand still.
▪Create Remarkable Teams: We will create a workplace culture that allows individuals to be their best in order to retain and attract talent from diverse industries, geographies and backgrounds.
Our Leadership Principles are the behaviors that provide definition to our actions and bring our values to life.
▪Embrace Diversity and Inclusion: We solicit and respect the input of others, celebrate our differences and strive for transparency and inclusiveness.
▪Seek to Listen: We listen to our customers, partners, and each other to reach the best solutions and make the strongest decisions.
▪Always Learn: To model a growth mindset, we continue learning through every stage of our careers. We do not quit and we are not satisfied with the status quo.
▪Be Authentic: Employees who thrive at Wabash are honest, have incredible energy and demonstrate grit in everything they do.
▪Win Together: We collaborate, seek alignment and excel at cross-group communication to succeed as one team and One Wabash.
Segment Realignment
The One Wabash organizational transformation began during the first quarter of 2020 to better align resources and processes on serving the customer and to enable long-term growth. In connection with the substantial completion of our One Wabash strategic initiatives, including organizational and structural changes as well as portfolio rationalization, beginning in September 2021 we realigned our operating and reportable segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions, and evaluates operating performance. Based on this realignment, we have established two operating and reportable segments: Transportation Solutions (“TS”) and Parts & Services (“P&S”), and eliminated the historical Commercial Trailer Products (“CTP”), Diversified Products (“DPG”), and Final Mile Products (“FMP”) segments. Accordingly, historical segment operating information and disclosures have been revised to conform to the current period segment presentation. Refer to the “Operating Segments” section below and Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding segments. In addition, refer to Note 5 for the impact thereof to the evaluation of recorded goodwill balances.
Rebranding
In January 2022, Wabash National Corporation and its portfolio of brands rebranded as Wabash® and began a significant shift in the Company’s go-to-market brand strategy. This marks a milestone in the Company’s transformation, following two years of accomplishments in our reorganization, new customer acquisition, and strategic growth as One Wabash. The rebrand is a reflection of our efforts and how we go-to-market with a powerful brand strategy designed to carry all of our legacy brands into the future.
The decision to make a significant shift in our brand strategy was precipitated by changes happening in the markets we serve. Transportation, logistics, and distribution is going through a momentous transition as it adapts to a compilation of forces: 
▪Changing dynamics across the value chain and logistics models of delivery
▪Increased dependence of supply chain security as an outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic
▪Increasingly agile and networked ecosystems enabled by new technologies
▪Advanced, disruptive material composites expanding possibilities of freight
▪Corporate stalwarts with increasing power, influence, and capabilities
▪Shifting societal attitudes around sustainability, diversity and inclusion
Wabash aims to be a visionary leader that drives the changing business of transport in ways that move the entire industry forward.
We see a different future reality than our competition in the context of social, technological, and logistics changes, and we’ve chosen to go down a substantially different path to re-shape the industry and pull that future forward for our customers. We saw how logistics changes would disrupt the industry and result in customers buying from one source, in one way, from first to final mile. We saw the need to radically change how products are conceived and designed upfront in engineering with new technologies to make leap-frog improvements in quality and consistency. We had the foresight to develop and commercialize a new composite technology that can deliver breakthrough value to customers. Going forward, we see the need to expand connectivity from the source all the way to the home to ensure food safety versus myopically focusing on point solutions.
As of January 2022, we market nearly all products in our Transportation Solutions and Parts & Services segments as Wabash® and no longer market the following brand names: Wabash National®, Benson®, Brenner® Tank, Brenner Tank Services, Bulk Tank International, Supreme®, Supreme Upfit Solutions and Service, Tower Structural Laminating, Transcraft®, Walker® Engineered Products, and Walker Transport. In addition, we no longer market the product brands ArcticLite®, Kold King®, Iner-City® and Spartan.
The Company will continue to market DuraPlate®, DuraPlateHD®, DuraPlate AeroSkirt®, and AeroSkirt CX®, as well as the new EcoNex™ Technology brand for our proprietary molded structural composite.
The rebranding decision resulted in non-cash impairment charges of approximately $28.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 related to trade name and trademark intangible assets due to the significant reduction in the related useful lives of these assets. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this impairment charge.
Wabash Management System
Our Wabash Management System (“WMS”) is a set of principles and standardized business processes for the purpose of achieving our strategic objectives. These principles are centered around lean thinking and state that lean application must extend across and throughout our entire enterprise, not only our manufacturing processes. By codifying what makes our company great, the WMS drives focus on the interconnected processes that are critical for success across our business. WMS is based on forward planning and continuous capability evaluation as we simultaneously drive execution and breakthrough performance. WMS requires everyone to be an active contributor to our enterprise-wide lean efforts and enables growth through innovation and industry leading customer satisfaction and alliances. Our WMS principles underpin an ongoing improvement cycle that includes Strategic Planning and Deployment, Kaizen, and Daily Management. It is through this set of standards and thinking that we create a “One Wabash” approach to our customers, add new business capabilities, and enable profitable growth.
Our One Wabash organizational structure enables long-term growth for the Company with an intense focus on value streams, streamlined processes, product innovation, and a consistent, superior experience for all customers who seek our solutions in the transportation, logistics and distribution markets. The value streams leverage the power of our processes to close the cycle of customer needs and customer fulfillment.
Impact of Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)
In March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) related to COVID-19. This pandemic created significant uncertainties and disruptions in the global economy and continues to have an ongoing impact on certain aspects of our business. We continue to closely monitor the pandemic and remain focused on the health and safety of our employees, as well as the health of our business. Additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as well as information regarding human capital management actions taken by Wabash in response to the pandemic, can be found under the section titled "COVID-19 Update" included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and risks related to COVID-19 can be found under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operating Segments
Beginning in September 2021 we realigned our operating and reportable segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions, and evaluates operating performance. Based on this realignment, we established two operating and reportable segments: TS and P&S, and eliminated the historical CTP, DPG, and FMP segments. Additional information related to the composition of each segment, as well as the historical segment for each component, is set forth below.

Transportation Solutions | Parts & Services 
■ Dry & Refrigerated Van Trailers (Historical CTP Segment) | ■ Aftermarket Parts & Services (All Historical Segments) 
■ Platform Trailers (Historical CTP Segment) | ■ Truck Body Upfitting Solutions (Historical FMP Segment) 
■ Tank Trailers & Truck-Mounted Tanks (Historical DPG Segment) | ■ Food, Dairy, and Beverage Equipment (Historical DPG Segment) 
■ Truck-Mounted Dry & Refrigerated Truck Bodies (Historical FMP Segment) | ■ DuraPlate® Components & Parts (Historical DPG Segment) 
■ EcoNex™ Technology Products (Historical CTP & FMP Segments) | 

Transportation Solutions
The TS segment comprises the design and manufacturing operations for the Company’s transportation-related equipment and products. This includes dry and refrigerated van trailers, platform trailers, and our wood flooring production facility, all of which were previously reported in the CTP segment. The Company’s EcoNex™ Technology products that were historically included in both the CTP and FMP segments are now reported in the TS segment. In addition, the TS segment includes tank trailers and truck-mounted tanks that were historically reported in the DPG segment. Finally, truck-mounted dry and refrigerated bodies and service and stake bodies that were previously reported in the FMP segment are also in the TS segment. Refer to the “Products” section below for additional information and details related to the TS segment’s product offerings.
Parts & Services
The P&S segment is comprised of each of our historical segments’ parts & services businesses as well as the upfitting component of our truck bodies business. In addition, our Composites products, which are focused on the use of DuraPlate® composite panels beyond the semi-trailer market, are also part of the P&S segment (previously reported in the DPG segment). Finally, the P&S segment includes the Company’s Engineered Products business (previously reported in the DPG segment), including stainless-steel storage tanks and silos, mixers, and processors for a variety of end markets. As disclosed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, growing and expanding our parts and services offerings is a key strategic initiative for us moving forward. Refer to the “Products” section below for additional information and details related to the P&S segment’s product offerings.
Strategy
We are an innovative engineered solutions provider with strong customer relationships across the first, middle, and final mile markets that will support profitable growth and provide adaptability to changes in the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries. We believe our One Wabash organizational structure and WMS are uniquely designed to achieve breakthrough customer value. Our new segment structure aligns our resources and processes on serving the customer, and our strategy is centered around our ability to scale core competencies by growing in and around core markets with known customers.

 | § Offset dilution from stock-based compensation 

Industry and Competition
Trucking in the U.S., according to the American Trucking Association (“ATA”), was estimated to be a $732.3 billion industry in 2020, representing approximately 80% of the total U.S. transportation industry revenue. From a financial (e.g., value) industry perspective, this represents a decrease of approximately 7.5% from ATA’s 2019 estimate but is consistent from the prior year as a percentage of the total U.S. transportation industry revenue (80%). Furthermore, ATA estimates that approximately 72.5% of all domestic freight tonnage in 2019 was carried by trucks, and 300.1 billion miles were traveled by registered trucks in 2019. Trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported. To meet this continued high demand for freight, truck carriers will need to replace and expand their fleets, which typically results in increased trailer orders.
Transportation in the U.S., including trucking, is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles (excluding 2020’s softened demand, which was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic) over the last 20 years. In each of the last three cycles the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general U.S. economic downturn and the recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry, experiencing cycles in the early and late 90’s lasting approximately 58 and 67 months, respectively. Truck freight tonnage, according to ATA statistics, started declining year-over-year in 2006 and remained at depressed levels through 2009, when the most recent cycle concluded. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the period ending December 31, 2019 demonstrated six consecutive years of healthy demand in which there were total trailer shipments of approximately 269,000, 308,000, 286,000, 288,000, 323,000, and 328,000 for the years ending 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
Consistent with our expectations and industry forecasters, 2020 brought softened demand that was worsened and magnified by the uncertainty and economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ACT Research Company (“ACT”), total U.S. trailer production in 2020 was approximately 206,000 trailers, which is generally below normal replacement demand levels. This represented a 38% decrease from 2019 production. However, 2021 recovered to production of approximately 266,000 trailers, which is more generally consistent with historic levels. The current estimate from ACT for 2022 United States trailer production is 298,000, representing an increase from 2021 of approximately 12%. Overall demand is expected to be in excess of replacement demand and industry specific indicators we track, including ATA’s truck tonnage index, carrier/fleet profitability, employment growth, housing and auto sectors, as well as the overall gross domestic product, continue to be positive indicators. Additional discussion and analysis is included under the section titled "Industry Trends" included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trailer manufacturers compete primarily through the quality of their products, customer relationships, innovative technology, and price. We have observed others in the industry also pursue the development and use of composite sidewalls that compete directly with our DuraPlate® products. Our product development is focused on maintaining a leading position with respect to these products and on development of new products and markets, leveraging products across our segments such as EcoNexTM Technology as well as our expertise in the engineering and design of customized products.
The tank trailers component of our Transportation Solutions segment and the engineered products component of our Parts & Services segment, in most cases, participate in markets different from our historical core van and platform trailer product offerings. The customers and end markets that these components serve are broader and more diverse than the van and platform trailer industries, including the dairy, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, chemical, craft brewing, biotech, and specialty vehicle markets. In addition, our diversification efforts pertain to new and emerging markets and many of the products are driven by regulatory requirements or, in most cases, customer-specific needs.
The truck body component of our Transportation Solutions segment competes in the specialized vehicle industry, whereby there are only a few national competitors and many smaller, regional companies. Competitive factors include quality of product, lead times, geographic proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications. With our national presence, diverse product offerings, and One Wabash approach to customer relationships, we believe that we are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges presented. In addition, a growing part of the truck body product line is directly aligned with our trailer customers.
Human Capital Resources and Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,200 full-time employees. Throughout 2021, essentially all of our active employees were non-union. Our temporary employees represented approximately 6% of our overall production workforce as of December 31, 2021.
We believe our commitment to our human capital resources is key to our mission to enable our customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that help them move everything from first to final mile. In addition, our human capital resources are at the core of our Values and Leadership Principles. The Company’s executives, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Senior Leadership Team”), are responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy and the design of employee compensation and benefits programs. The Senior Leadership Team is also responsible for developing and integrating the Company’s diversity and inclusion roadmap. In addition, regular updates are provided to the Company’s Board of Directors and its committees on the operation and status of human capital trends and activities. Key areas of focus for the Company include:
▪Employee Engagement – We define engagement as a deep connection and sense of purpose at work that creates extra energy and commitment. Our goal is to engineer a winning culture that is designed to execute the Company’s strategic plan. Over the long-term, we seek better outcomes from having a highly engaged and values-aligned workforce, including higher retention, higher productivity, better customer satisfaction, better quality, and better safety. We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on our culture through an annual employee engagement survey. Results of the survey are measured and analyzed to enhance the employee experience, promote employee retention, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization.
▪Talent Development – One of our company values is Always Learn. We put that into practice by offering our own welding and skills training courses, self-directed learning modules and an executive leadership development program at no cost to employees. Additionally, we host a wide variety of learning and development opportunities through our custom-tailored Learning Management System — Wabash U. Our employees have access through an online portal to thousands of self-directed and instructor-led courses on a variety of professional development topics. Our employees also have access to WMS University (“WMS U”), which was developed and accredited by Purdue University’s Dauch Center for the Management of Manufacturing Enterprises and TP3 Institute for smart manufacturing. WMS U teaches participants about our WMS systems and tools in our lean enterprise, the goal of which is to equip our employees with the knowledge to live WMS principles every day.
Targeted learning and development opportunities are also created through external partnerships, including special development programs for front line leaders, as well as focused executive development across a variety of topics. Full-time Wabash employees can pursue various courses, undergraduate and graduate degree programs, or relevant certifications at an accredited college or university without added financial burden by using our Accelerator tuition reimbursement program. We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. In addition, Wabash employees and dependents of employees are eligible for a variety of scholarships offered by Wabash and the industry associations to which we belong. We support the youth in our communities through program funding, training programs, internships, and co-ops. We also sponsor youth clubs in our communities, including robotics clubs, STEM programs, and the Purdue University’s Women in Engineering Program. In 2021, we awarded 10 high school graduates with Wabash scholarships totaling $50,000.
▪Focus on Safety – At Wabash, safety is our first priority. We prioritize the safety of our employees, our customers, and our communities. We demonstrate this core value by working on innovations to protect the people who operate our equipment. In addition, we partner with other manufacturers in the industry to further promote safety by sharing best practices and ideas for implementing higher standards.
We continually focus on reducing the severity and frequency of workplace injuries to create a safe environment for our employees. We provide ongoing safety training and development at our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. Our employees are encouraged to identify safety opportunities and report near-misses through our safety good catch program. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. For example, a lagging indicator includes the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”). TRIR in 2021 was 5.2, which is one of the Company’s best-ever years for TRIR performance, and there were no work-related fatalities. A leading metric we use is scoring from our Blueprint for Excellence, which assesses a facility’s overall safety program and identifies key areas of improvement. In 2020, Wabash implemented a software platform to proactively mitigate safety risks by driving business decisions based on actionable insights and advanced analytics.
Our safety awards include:
◦2020 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards (Fond du Lac, WI, and San José Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico)
◦2019 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Award (New Lisbon, WI)
◦2018 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Award (San José Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico)
◦2017 Kentucky Governor’s Safety and Health Award (Cadiz, KY)
◦2016 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards (New Lisbon, WI, and San José Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico)
◦2015 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards (New Lisbon, WI)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government orders. For additional information regarding our COVID-19 employee safety measures, refer to the section titled "COVID-19 Update" included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
▪Health and Wellness – The health and wellness of our employees is critical to our success. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Such programs are designed to support employees' physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.
▪Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Wabash is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and embraces inclusion at all levels, reflecting the diversity of our customers and the varied environments in which we conduct business around the globe. Recognizing, valuing, and fully leveraging our different perspectives and backgrounds to achieve our business goals demonstrate our inclusive culture and are part of our Leadership Principles (“Embrace Diversity and Inclusion”). We need inclusion and diversity to achieve our targeted business results and fulfill our vision of being the innovation leader of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics and distribution industries. Openness to diversity widens our access to the best talent, and inclusion allows us to engage that talent fully. In addition, we place special focus on preventing pay imbalances among genders, including proactive adjustments to pay, titles, and/or benefits to prevent gender pay gaps.
In 2021, 62% of our total hourly hires were women and minorities, and 42% of total salaried hires in 2021 were women and minorities.
▪Compensation and Benefits – Wabash is dedicated and committed to providing a comprehensive total compensation and benefits program that is competitive within the local market as well as the industries we serve. Our compensation and benefits program not only ensures external market competitiveness and internal equity, but it also maintains a strong emphasis on performance. The tenets of our compensation philosophy are:
◦Compensation is calibrated to market to facilitate access to needed talent.
◦Compensation is transparent to help employees clearly understand all components of their compensation.
◦Compensation is connected to individual performance and, in some cases, performance of the organization.
◦Compensation enables purpose by being connected to the Company’s values and leadership principles.
In addition to salaries, these programs can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, safety shoe and prescription safety glass programs, an employee assistance program, and tuition assistance, among many others.
▪Community Involvement – Wabash’s charitable giving program combines volunteer work with financial support to make a meaningful, lasting impact on our communities. We actively partner with nonprofit groups and projects to donate time, needed materials and financial resources to support the communities where we live and work. We place special emphasis on combating food insecurity in our communities, as well as supporting children and veterans. We believe that enriching the lives of those around us is a powerful investment in our future. Involvement in our communities is unique to our various locations. In 2021, we donated more than $550,000 through corporate gifts and employee donations to nonprofit organizations, including but not limited to, United Way, Junior Achievement, Purdue Foundation, YWCA, YMCA, local schools and more. We have also established a Day of Giving Program, which allows all full-time hourly and salaried employees with the opportunity to volunteer one scheduled workday each calendar year. In 2021, employees volunteered at local homeless shelters, veteran services agencies, local agriculture organizations, food pantries, local schools’ leadership and career readiness programs, Junior Achievement, Salvation Army, Wreaths Across America, and youth athletics and arts programs.
Our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report is available on our website (ir.onewabash.com) and references the ongoing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The content on any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our core competitive strengths include, but are not limited to:
▪Long-Term Core Customer Relationships – We are the leading provider of trailers to a significant number of top tier trucking companies, generating a revenue base that has helped to sustain us as one of the market leaders. Our van products are preferred by many of the industry’s leading carriers. We are also a leading provider of liquid-transportation systems and engineered products and we have a strong customer base, consisting of mostly private fleets, and have earned a leading market position across many of the markets we serve. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of truck bodies, and we have a strong customer base of large national fleet leasing companies and large retailers.
▪Technology and Innovation – We continue to be recognized by the trucking industry as a leader in developing technology to provide value-added solutions for our customers that reduce trailer operating costs, improve revenue opportunities, and solve unique transportation problems. Throughout our history, we have been and we expect to continue to be a leading innovator in the design and production of trailers and related products. We have commercialized and launched DuraPlate® Cell Core, a modified DuraPlate® panel that reduces the weight of a conventional 53 foot DuraPlate® trailer by 300 pounds without compromising strength or durability. Our refrigerated van offerings now include EcoNexTM Technology. In connection with our Cold Chain strategic initiative, a refrigerated trailer with EcoNexTM Technology is up to 30% more thermally efficient than a conventional refrigerated van, and is lighter with greater strength and durability. During 2021, we received the 2021 Indiana Manufacturers Association’s Manufacturing Excellence Award for Innovation for our EcoNexTM Technology. We are leveraging this innovative technology in other facets of our business, such as the final mile and home delivery space.
During 2020, in combination with technologies from eNowTM and Carrier Transicold, we introduced a zero-emission composite refrigerated trailer. This innovative trailer is now commercially available and provides customers a zero-emission refrigerated transportation solution that is more energy efficient and has a lower operating cost. In 2021, our zero-emission composite refrigerated trailer was recognized as a Top 20 Product by Heavy Duty Trucking.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2021 we entered into an agreement with Gruau SAS to manufacture their refrigerated van inserts. These refrigerated inserts are superior to spray foam and are engineered to provide premium performance in the Cold Chain final mile market. These inserts hold temperature and eliminate issues with mold and degradation and are compliant with the Food Safety Modernization Act.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced plans to launch a walk-in cargo van by 2023, adding to our expanding portfolio of home delivery solutions and a product line critical in supporting key customer efforts to efficiently scale home delivery driven by e-commerce. This announcement came shortly after our launch of a next-generation grocery delivery vehicle that features our innovative EcoNexTM Technology.
Finally, we announced in December 2021 that we partnered with Purdue University to accelerate the Company’s speed to market with proprietary, innovative products. The partnership connects Wabash to Purdue’s Office of Industry Partnerships, allowing us to leverage Purdue University’s resources to deliver new and improved sustainability-focused solutions to the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries.
▪Significant Brand Recognition – In January 2022, Wabash National Corporation and its portfolio of brands rebranded as Wabash® and began a significant shift in the Company’s go-to-market brand strategy. This rebranding provides the foundation to build upon our history of being one of the most widely recognized brands in the industry, recognized for quality, performance, and innovation leadership.
▪WMS and Enterprise Lean – Our Wabash Management System (“WMS”) is a set of principles and standardized business processes for the purpose of achieving our strategic objectives. By codifying what makes our company great, the WMS drives focus on the interconnected processes that are critical for success across our business. WMS is based on forward planning and continuous capability evaluation as we simultaneously drive execution and breakthrough performance. WMS requires everyone to be an active contributor to our enterprise-wide lean efforts and enables growth through innovation and industry leading customer satisfaction and alliances. Our WMS principles underpin an ongoing improvement cycle that includes Strategic Planning and Deployment, Kaizen, and Daily Management. It is through this set of standards and thinking that we create a “One Wabash” approach to our customers, add new business capabilities, and enable profitable growth.
Safety, quality, delivery, cost, morale, and environment are the core elements of our program of continuous improvement. We currently maintain an ISO 14001 registration of the Environmental Management System at four facilities, which include our Lafayette, Indiana; Cadiz, Kentucky; San José Iturbide, Mexico; and Harrison, Arkansas locations. In addition, we have achieved ISO 9001 registration of the Quality Management Systems at our Lafayette, Indiana and Cadiz, Kentucky facilities.
▪Corporate Culture – As further described above in the “Human Capital Resources and Management” section, we believe strong human capital acts as a competitive differentiator and our focus is not only on ensuring we have the right leaders in place to drive our strategic initiatives today, but also to nurture our talent pipeline to develop strong leaders for our company’s future. To that end, we benefit from an experienced, value-driven management team and dedicated workforce. 
We strive to achieve alignment at every layer and throughout all functional areas of our business and are focused on ensuring the right systems are in place to facilitate all team members working toward the same shared goals. Critical to this is the One Wabash mindset that our business is constructed of three interlinked segments that benefit from one another and are stronger as a result of being part of Wabash.
▪Extensive Distribution Network – We utilize a network of 23 independent dealers with approximately 80 locations throughout North America to distribute our van trailers, and our platform trailer distribution network consists of 64 independent dealers with approximately 93 locations throughout North America. Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 54 independent dealers with 56 locations throughout North America. Additionally, our truck body commercial network consists of more than 1,000 partners. Our commercial network primarily serves mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the partner is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets.
Regulation
Truck trailer length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain safety and environmental sustainability features incorporated in the design and use of truck and tank trailers, as well as truck bodies. These regulations include: requirements to install Electronic Logging Devices, the use of aerodynamic devices and fuel saving technologies, as well as operator restrictions as to hours of service and minimum driver safety standards (see “Industry Trends” included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details on these regulations). In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws enforced by federal, state and local agencies (see “Environmental Matters”).
Products
Since our inception, we have worked to expand our product offerings from a single truck trailer dry van product to a broad range of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries to help our customers move everything from first to final mile. We manage a diverse product portfolio, maintain long-standing customer relationships, and focus on innovative and breakthrough technologies within two operating segments.
Our current Transportation Solutions segment primarily includes the following products:
▪Van, Platform, and Tank Trailers
◦Dry Van Trailers. The dry van market represents our largest product line and includes trailers sold under the DuraPlate® and DuraPlate HD® trademarks. Our DuraPlate® trailers utilize a proprietary technology that consists of a composite plate wall for increased durability and greater strength. In addition, we have introduced DuraPlate® Cell Core, a modified DuraPlate® panel that reduces the weight of a conventional 53-foot DuraPlate® trailer by 300 pounds.
◦Platform Trailers. Platform trailers were sold under the Transcraft® and Benson® trademarks until the January 2022 rebranding as Wabash®. Platform trailers consist of a trailer chassis with a flat or “drop” loading deck without permanent sides or a roof. These trailers are primarily utilized to haul steel coils, construction materials, and large equipment. In addition to our all steel and combination steel and aluminum platform trailers, we also offer a premium all-aluminum platform trailer.
◦Refrigerated Trailers. Our refrigerated trailers provide thermal efficiency, maximum payload capacity, and superior damage resistance. Our refrigerated trailers were sold under the ArcticLite® trademark until the January 2022 rebranding as Wabash® and use our proprietary SolarGuard® technology, coupled with our foaming process, which we believe enables customers to achieve lower costs through reduced operating hours of refrigeration equipment and therefore reduced fuel consumption. As previously discussed, our refrigerated trailer with EcoNex™ Technology provides up to 30% improvement in thermal performance over conventional construction, prevents water intrusion, slows foam degradation, and ultimately, extends equipment life. The all-composite floor system of the refrigerated trailer with EcoNex™ Technology increases cube capacity and eliminates corrosion issues of conventional refrigerated trailers. The EcoNex™ sidewalls, nose, and roof provide up to 2x the puncture resistance of standard liners, keeping maintenance costs at a minimum.
◦Tank Trailers. Our tank trailer offerings include several products dedicated to transportation solutions. These brands included WalkerTM Transport, Brenner® Tank, and Bulk Tank International until the January 2022 rebranding as Wabash®. Our product offerings in this component of the TS segment include stainless steel and aluminum tank trailers for the dairy, food and beverage, oil, gas, and chemical end markets, dry bulk trailers, and fiberglass reinforced poly tank trailers.
◦Specialty Trailers. These products include a wide array of specialty equipment and services generally focused on products that require a higher degree of customer specifications and requirements. These specialty products primarily relate to converter dollies.
▪Truck Bodies and Related Products
◦Signature Van Bodies. Signature van bodies range from 8 to 28 feet in length with exterior walls assembled from one of several material options including pre-painted aluminum, FiberPanel PW, FiberPanel HC, or DuraPlate®. Additional features include molded composite front and side corners, LED marker lights, sealed wiring harnesses, hardwood or pine flooring, and various door configurations to accommodate end-user loading and unloading requirements. This product is adaptable for a diverse range of uses in dry-freight transportation. Until January 2022’s rebranding as Wabash®, these signature van bodies were marketed under the Supreme® brand name.
◦Cutaway Van Bodies. An ideal route truck for a variety of commercial applications, these van bodies are manufactured on cutaway chassis which allow access from the cab to the cargo area. Borrowing many design elements from our larger van bodies, the cutaway van bodies are shorter in length (8 to 18 feet) than a typical van body. Until January 2022’s rebranding as Wabash®, these cutaway van bodies were marketed under the Iner-City® product brand.
◦Service Bodies. Built on a cutaway chassis and constructed of FiberPanel PW or DuraPlate®, the cargo van service body provides the smooth maneuverability of a commercial van with the full-height and spacious cargo area of a truck body. In lengths of 8 to 14 feet and available with a variety of pre-designed options, the cargo van body is a bridge product for those moving up from a traditional cargo van into the truck body category. Until January 2022’s rebranding as Wabash®, these service bodies were marketed under the Spartan product brand.
◦Insulated Van Bodies. Insulated van bodies, in lengths up to 28 feet, provide versatility and dependability for temperature controlled applications. Flexible for either hand-load or pallet-load requirements, they are ideal for multi-stop distribution of both fresh and frozen products. Until January 2022’s rebranding as Wabash®, these insulated van bodies were marketed under the Kold King® brand name.
◦Stake Bodies. Stake bodies are flatbeds with various configurations of removable sides. The stake body is utilized for a broad range of agricultural and construction industries’ transportation needs.
◦Light-Duty Refrigerated Bodies with EcoNexTM Technology. Our new light-duty, home delivery refrigerated truck body with EcoNexTM Technology is designed to maximize both cargo capacity and delivery productivity on sub-10,000 GVWR chassis. The purpose-built design facilitates a rack and tote system unique to the food distribution industry while creating easy access to separate temperature zones for fresh and frozen goods.
▪Other Transportation Solutions Components
◦Used Trailers. These products include the sale of used trailers through our used fleet sales center to facilitate additional new trailer sales with a focus on selling both large and small fleet trade packages to the wholesale market.
◦Wood Products. We manufacture laminated hardwood oak flooring used primarily in our dry van trailer products at our manufacturing operations located in Harrison, Arkansas.
Our current Parts & Services segment primarily includes the following products:
▪Upfit, Parts, and Services Offerings
◦Aftermarket Parts and Services. Aftermarket component products are manufactured to provide continued support to our customers throughout the life-cycle of the trailer. Utilizing our on-site service centers, we provide a wide array of quality aftermarket parts and services to our customers. In addition, we provide parts and maintenance and repair services for tank trailers and other related equipment through our five tank service centers.
◦Truck Body Upfitting, Parts, and Services. Through our truck body upfitting locations, we offer solutions to help customize and ensure our products meet the needs of our customers. Offerings include aluminum and steel flatbed bodies, shelving for package delivery, partitions, roof racks, hitches, thermal solutions, liftgates, and more. We also offer direct-line access to truck body repair parts and provide other services such as door repair and replacement, collision repair, and basic maintenance. We currently have six locations throughout the United States for truck body parts and services, five of which also offer upfitting services.
▪Engineered Products
◦Engineered Products. Our engineered products component was marketed under the Walker Engineered Products brand through January 2022 until the Company rebranded as Wabash®. Product offerings include stainless steel storage tanks and silos, mixers, and processors for the dairy, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, chemical, craft brewing, and biotech end markets. As further described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K, during the second quarter of 2021 we sold the Extract Technology® business. Extract Technology® manufactured stainless steel isolators and downflow booths, as well as custom-fabricated equipment including workstations and drum booths for the pharmaceutical, fine chemical, biotech, and nuclear end markets.
▪Other Parts & Services Product Offerings
◦Composites. Our Composites products focus on the use of DuraPlate® composite panels beyond the semi-trailer market. Product offerings include truck bodies, overhead doors, and other industrial applications. We continue to develop new products and actively explore markets that can benefit from the proven performance of our proprietary technology. We offer a full line of aerodynamic solutions designed to improve overall trailer aerodynamics and fuel economy, most notably the DuraPlate® AeroSkirt®, which is EPA Smartway® verified and California Air Resource Board compliant.
◦Used Trailers. These products include the sale of used trailers that do not occur through our used fleet sales center.
Customers
Our customer base has historically included many of the nation’s largest truckload common carriers, leasing companies, private fleet carriers, less-than-truckload common carriers, and package carriers. We continue to expand our customer base and achieve diversification through acquisitions, organic growth, product innovation, and through our extensive distribution and service network. All of these efforts have been accomplished while maintaining our relationships with our core customers. Our five largest customers together accounted for approximately 30%, 21%, and 27% of our aggregate net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% or more of our aggregate net sales during the past three years. International sales accounted for less than 10% of net sales for each of the last three years.
We have established relationships as a supplier to many large customers in the transportation industry for our dry and refrigerated van products, platform trailers, and tank trailers, including the following:
▪Truckload Carriers: Averitt Express, Inc.; Covenant Transportation Group, Inc.; Cowan Systems, LLC; Crete Carrier Corporation; Heartland Express, Inc.; J.B Hunt Transport, Inc.; Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc.; and Werner Enterprises, Inc.
▪Less-Than-Truckload Carriers: FedEx Corporation; Old Dominion Freight Lines, Inc.; R&L Carriers Inc.; and Saia, Inc.

Through our engineered products component of the Parts & Services segment we also sell our products to other customers including, but not limited to, GlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited and W.M. Sprinkman.
In addition, we sell our truck bodies to fleet leasing customers and direct customers including, but not limited to: Amazon.com; Budget Truck Rental, LLC; Enterprise Holdings, Inc.; Penske Truck Leasing Company; Rent-A-Center; and Ryder System, Inc.
Marketing and Distribution
We market and distribute our products through the following channels:
▪Factory direct accounts; and
▪Independent dealerships.
Factory direct accounts are generally large fleets that are high volume purchasers. Historically, we have focused on the factory direct market in which customers are highly knowledgeable of the life-cycle costs of equipment and, therefore, are best equipped to appreciate the innovative design and value-added features of our products, as well as the value proposition for lower total cost of ownership over the life-cycle of our products.
We also sell our van, platform, and tank trailers through a network of independent dealers. Additionally, our truck body products are sold through commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets. The dealers may also perform service and warranty work for our customers.
Raw Materials
We utilize a variety of raw materials and components including, but not limited to, specialty steel coil, stainless steel, plastic, aluminum, lumber, tires, landing gear, axles and suspensions, which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. While we manage some of our commodity price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers and through financial derivatives, raw material costs as a percentage of net sales for 2021 increased compared to 2020. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in raw materials or finished components have had, and could have in the future, adverse effects on our results of operations. In 2022 and for the foreseeable future, we expect that the raw materials used in the greatest quantity will be steel, aluminum, plastic, and wood. We will continue to endeavor to pass along raw material and component cost increases. Price increases used to offset inflation or disruption of supply in core materials have generally been successful, although sometimes are delayed. Increases in prices for these purposes represent a risk in execution. In an effort to minimize the effect of price fluctuations, we hedge certain commodities that have the potential to significantly impact our results of operations.
Backlog
Orders that have been confirmed by customers in writing, have defined delivery timeframes and can be produced during the next 18 months are included in our backlog. Orders that comprise our backlog may be subject to changes in quantities, delivery, specifications, terms or cancellation. Our backlog of orders at December 31, 2021 was approximately $2,526 million, which is an increase of 70% from the backlog as of December 31, 2020 of $1,482 million. This increase from 2020 is related to, in part, shortages of raw materials, components, and labor, as well as increased demand for our products in 2022. We believe our backlog of orders is strong as of December 31, 2021. We generally expect to complete the majority of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2021 within the next 12 months.
Patents and Intellectual Property
We hold or have applied for 147 patents in the U.S. on various components and techniques utilized in our manufacture of transportation equipment and engineered products. In addition, we hold or have applied for 152 patents or registered designs in foreign countries. Our patents include intellectual property related to the manufacture of trailers, containers, truck bodies, platform trailers, tanks, and other engineered products—all of which we believe offer us a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete.
Many of our patents include intellectual property related to the manufacture of trailers, containers, truck bodies, platforms, and rail cars using our proprietary EcoNex™ Technology. Our EcoNex™ Technology is a molded structural composite technology and these patents and patent applications cover the use of extruded foam bricks assembled and cured together in different configurations with resins and fiber mats to create various components and structures including, for example, wall panels and flooring assemblies. We believe the intellectual property related to this use of composite technology in our industry, including proprietary knowledge of the processes involved in manufacturing these components and the resulting products, will offer us a significant market advantage to continue to create proprietary products exploiting this technology. These patent applications will not begin to expire until 2036.
Our DuraPlate® patent portfolio includes several patents and pending patent applications, which cover not only utilization of our DuraPlate® products in the manufacture of trailers, but also cover a number of aerodynamic-related products aimed at increasing the fuel efficiency of trailers, including DuraPlate AeroSkirt®. U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our DuraPlate® patent portfolio have expiration dates extending until 2036. Certain U.S. patents relating to the combined use of DuraPlate® panels and logistics systems within the sidewalls of our dry van trailers will not expire until 2027 or after; several other issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications relating to the use of DuraPlate® panels, or other composite materials, within aerodynamic-related products will not begin to expire until after 2030. Additionally, we also believe that our proprietary DuraPlate® and DuraPlate® Cell Core production processes, which have been developed and refined since 1995, offer us a significant competitive advantage in the industry – above and beyond the benefits provided by any patent protection concerning the use and/or design of our DuraPlate® products. We believe the proprietary knowledge of these processes and the significant intellectual and capital hurdles in creating similar production processes provide us with an advantage over others in the industry who utilize composite sandwich panel technology. 
Additionally, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents related to the rear impact guard (“RIG”). The RIG patents include RIG designs which surpass the current and proposed federal regulatory RIG standards for the U.S. and Canada and will not begin to expire until 2035.
In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering many trailer industry components. These products have become highly desirable and are recognized for their innovation in the markets we serve. These patents include, for example, those covering the Trust Lock Plus® door locking mechanism, the Max Clearance® Overhead Door System, which provides additional overhead clearance when an overhead-style rear door is in the opened position that would be comparable to that of swing-door models, the use of bonded or riveted intermediate logistics strips, the bonded D-ring hold-down device, bonded skylights, and the DuraPlate® arched roof. The patents covering these products will not expire before 2029. We believe all of these proprietary products offer us a competitive market advantage in the industries in which we compete.
We also hold or have applied for 49 trademarks in the U.S. as well as 65 trademarks in foreign countries. These trademarks include the Wabash® brand as well as trademarks associated with our proprietary products such as DuraPlate®, Transcraft Eagle®, MaxClearance® Overhead Door System, Trust Lock Plus®, EZ-7®, DuraPlate Aeroskirt®, Aeroskirt CX®, DuraPlate HD®, Lock-Rite®, and EZ-Adjust®. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we also applied for the EcoNex™ Technology trademark in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Australia to cover our proprietary molded structural composites technology featured in many of our refrigerated solutions. We believe all of these trademarks are important for the identification of our products and the associated customer goodwill; however, our business is not materially dependent on such trademarks.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and occupational safety and health. Our operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of enforcement actions or proceedings for non-compliance with such laws or for remediation of company-related releases of substances into the environment. Resolution of such matters with regulators can result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, the payment of penalties (see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 for more details).
We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our facilities have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. However, we currently do not anticipate that the future costs of environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
