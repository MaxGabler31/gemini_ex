ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview and Strategy
 
We are a direct-to-patient telehealth technology company that provides a smarter, cost-effective, and convenient way for Americans to access healthcare. We believe the traditional model of visiting a doctor’s office, visiting a local pharmacy, and returning to see a doctor for follow up care or prescription refills is inefficient, costly, and slow, and discourages many individuals from seeking much needed medical care. The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing a paradigm shift, thanks to new technologies and the emergence of telehealth. Direct-to-patient telehealth companies, like LifeMD, Inc., are leading the shift by connecting consumers digitally to licensed healthcare professionals for care across various needs, such as virtual primary care, men’s sexual health, dermatology, and others.


Our telehealth platform provides patients with access to licensed providers for diagnoses, virtual care, and prescription medications, often delivered on a recurring basis. In addition to our telehealth offerings, we sell complementary nutritional supplements and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products. Many of our products are available on a subscription basis, where patients can subscribe to receive regular shipments of prescribed medications or products. This creates convenience and discounted pricing opportunities for patients and recurring revenue streams for us. Our customer acquisition strategy combines strategic brand-building media placements, influencer partnerships, and direct response advertising methods across highly scalable marketing channels (i.e., national TV, streaming TV, streaming audio, YouTube, podcasts, Out of Home, print, magazines, online search, social media, and digital).
 
Since inception, we have helped more than 490,000 customers and patients, providing them greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable care in all 50 states. Our telehealth revenue increased 123% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. Total revenue from recurring subscriptions is approximately 90%. In addition to our telehealth business, we own 85.6% of WorkSimpli, which operates PDFSimpli, a rapidly growing software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform for converting, signing, editing, and sharing PDF documents. This business has seen 267% year over year revenue growth, with recurring revenue of 98%.
 
We believe that telehealth platforms like ours will fundamentally shift how individuals perceive and access healthcare in the United States, by necessity and by preference. With the average wait time to see a physician in the United States now greater than 29 days, according to a 2018 Merritt Hawkins Survey, and the United States’ projected significant shortfall of licensed physicians by 2030, we believe the U.S. healthcare infrastructure must change to accommodate patients. Timely and convenient access to healthcare and prescription medications is a critical factor in improving quality of care and patient outcomes. Our mission is to radically change healthcare with our portfolio of direct-to-patient telehealth brands that encompass on-demand medical treatment, online pharmacy, and OTC products. We want our brands to be top-of-mind for consumers considering telehealth.
 
In the United States, healthcare spending is currently $4.0 trillion and is expected to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Physician services and prescription medications account for approximately 30% of healthcare spending, or over $1 trillion annually, and we believe that we have the infrastructure, medical expertise, and technical know-how necessary to help shift a substantial portion of this market to an online, virtual format. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this large-scale shift in healthcare.
 
We believe that an amazing customer experience, incredible healthcare, and new customer acquisition form the heart of our business. As is exemplified with our first brand, Shapiro MD, we have built a full line of proprietary and patented OTC products for male and female hair loss, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved OTC minoxidil, and now a telehealth platform offering that gives consumers access to virtual medical treatment and, when appropriate, a full line of oral and topical prescription medications for hair loss. Our men’s brand, RexMD, currently offers access to provider-based treatment through telehealth for men’s health conditions, such as sexual health and hair loss. RexMD continues to expand its treatment offerings to address additional chronic indications present in men’s health. We have built a platform that allows us to efficiently launch telehealth brands and offerings wherever we identify a market need. Our platform is supported by a driven team of digital marketing and branding experts, data analysts, designers, and engineers focused on building enduring brands.
 
Our Brand Portfolio and Virtual Primary Care Platform
 
We have built a strategic portfolio of wholly-owned telehealth platform brands supported by an affiliated, 50-state physician network and an integrated national network of third party pharmacies that address large unmet needs in men’s health, hair loss, virtual primary care, and dermatology. We continue to experience aggressive growth across our brands.

Our process across each brand and condition we treat is to guide consumers through a medical intake process and product selection, after which a licensed U.S. physician conducts a virtual consultation and, if appropriate, prescribes prescription medications and/or recommends OTC products. Prescription medications and OTC products are filled by pharmacy fulfillment partners and shipped directly to the patient. The number of patients and customers we serve across the nation continues to increase at a robust pace, with more than 490,000 individuals having purchased our products and services to date.
 
Hair Loss: ShapiroMD
 
Launched in 2017, ShapiroMD is a telehealth platform brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment, prescription medications, patented-doctor formulated OTC products, an FDA approved medical device for male and female hair loss, and female specific topical compounded medications for hair loss through our telehealth platform. ShapiroMD has emerged as a leading destination for hair loss treatment across the United States and has served more than 230,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.9-star Trustpilot rating.
Men’s Health: RexMD
 
Launched in 2019, RexMD is a men’s telehealth platform brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment for a variety of men’s health needs. After treatment from a licensed physician, if appropriate, one of our partner pharmacies will dispense and ship prescription medications and OTC products directly to the customer. Since RexMD’s initial launch in the erectile dysfunction treatment market, it has expanded into additional indications, including but not limited to, premature ejaculation, testosterone, and hair loss. Our vision for RexMD is to become a leading telehealth destination for men. RexMD has emerged as a leading men’s telehealth platform across the United States and has served more than 250,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.6-star Trustpilot rating.
Variable Interest Entity: LifeMD Primary Care
 
Beta launched in the fourth quarter of 2021, LifeMD PC is a personalized, subscription-based virtual primary care platform. The LifeMD PC clinic provides patients in all 50 states with 24/7 access to a high-quality provider for their primary care, urgent care and chronic care needs. LifeMD PC offers a mobile first platform that incorporates virtual consultations and treatment, prescription medications, diagnostics, and imaging. LifeMD PC capabilities are supported by robust partnerships as further discussed below. No revenue was recorded related to the LifeMD PC during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Dermatology: NavaMD
 
Launched in the first quarter of 2021, NavaMD is a female-oriented, tele-dermatology brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment from dermatologists and other providers, and, if appropriate, prescription oral and compounded topical medications to treat dermatological conditions such as aging and acne. In addition to the brand’s telehealth offerings, NavaMD’s proprietary products leverage intellectual property and proprietary formulations licensed from Restorsea, a leading medical grade skincare technology platform.
 
Restorsea’s clinically proven skincare technology platform is the result of more than $50 million invested in R&D and intellectual property development, and Restorsea has received at least 35 patents along with broad industry and academic acclaim, with its breakthrough clinical results having been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Drugs in Dermatology and Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology. NavaMD is one of the first direct-to-patient brands to offer this advanced skincare technology.
 
Allergy, Asthma & Immunology: Cleared
 
In January 2022, the Company acquired Cleared, a telehealth brand that provides personalized treatments for allergy, asthma, and immunology. Its offerings include in-home tests for both environmental and food allergies, prescriptions for allergies and asthma, and FDA-approved immunotherapies for treating chronic allergies. Cleared leverages a network of medical professionals and providers in all 50 states, a growing pipeline of pharmaceutical partners, and treatments and tests that cost up to 50 percent less than the brand-name competition. The offerings include free consultations and ongoing care from U.S.-licensed allergists and nurses.
Majority Owned Subsidiary: WorkSimpli
 
WorkSimpli operates PDFSimpli, an online SaaS platform that allows users to create, edit, convert, sign and share PDF documents. WorkSimpli was acquired through the purchase of 51% of the membership interests of WorkSimpli Software, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company, which operates a marketing-driven software solutions business. In addition to WorkSimpli’s growth business model, this acquisition added deep search engine optimization and search engine marketing expertise to the Company. On January 22, 2021, the Company increased its ownership of WorkSimpli to 85.6%.

WorkSimpli was ranked in the top 4,160 websites globally, in which it was also ranked in the top 563 for specific countries with more than 19 million registrants globally. Since its launch, WorkSimpli has converted or edited over 14 terabytes of documents for customers from the legal, financial, real-estate and academic sectors. WorkSimpli had over 102,000 active subscriptions as of December 31, 2021.
 
Customers
 
Our customer base includes men and women seeking virtual primary care and virtual medical treatment for hair loss, men’s sexual health issues, dermatology, and allergy and asthma. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
We are focused on revolutionizing the way that patients access healthcare to positively impact their long-term health and satisfaction. In the United States, healthcare spending is currently $4.0 trillion and is expected to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Despite this growing spend, the existing healthcare system is fragmented and inefficient, lacks price transparency, and is generally unfriendly to the consumer. In addition, a myriad of issues related to insurance coverage and other cost barriers stand in the way of many Americans getting the treatment they need in a timely and efficient manner. Patients are at the mercy of a multitude of gatekeepers at every level – with the service provider, in acquiring medication, and in the insurance reimbursement process – leading to confusion and frustration for consumers. A 2018 Journal of Patient Experience paper found that among 9,166 patients surveyed through the national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Database, only 28% of respondents rated their satisfaction with their healthcare experience as “optimal;” 61% of respondents rated their satisfaction as “average;” and 11% said “poor.” A 2021 PwC Health Research Institute paper found that 75% of consumers would like a wellness visit or physical to be able to happen at home. Additionally, a 2021 SPH Analytics’ ongoing consumer telehealth survey found that 70% of patients prefer virtual visits over an in-person appointment to save time.
 
We believe that telehealth platforms like LifeMD will fundamentally shift how patients think about and access healthcare in the U.S. – by necessity and by preference. With the average wait time to see a physician in the U.S. now greater than 29 days according to a 2018 Merritt Hawkins Survey and the U.S. projected to have a significant shortfall of licensed physicians by 2030, the U.S. healthcare infrastructure must change to accommodate patients. At the same time, consumers are ready for better options.
 
We believe we are in the early stages of the digitization of healthcare; additionally, telehealth’s adoption has been rapidly expedited by the emergence of the global coronavirus pandemic. Doctors across the U.S. were forced to close offices and adopt telehealth in short order as the novel coronavirus took hold of the U.S. in 2020. Telehealth, and, more specifically, direct-to-consumer telehealth, has since cemented itself as a mainstream way to access healthcare. A December 2021 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that 25.6 million Medicare primary care visits were provided via telehealth in 2020 compared to 400,000 in 2019, an increase of 63 times the number of Medicare primary care visits provided via telehealth in 2019.
 
Telehealth’s novel approach to offering convenient healthcare helps bridge many of the inefficiencies that plague the U.S. healthcare system today. Telehealth enables more efficient allocation and utilization of existing clinical resources that might otherwise go unused. With an aging population requiring more complex care and a younger generation that is accustomed to digital technology, telehealth offers an efficient way to leverage finite resources. A Journal of General Internal Medicine article from 2016 evaluated patient satisfaction with U.S. telehealth services in comparison to in-office visits: between 94% and 99% of survey respondents reported being “very satisfied” with all telehealth attributes, and over 70% of respondents would use telehealth again and would recommend telehealth to someone else.
 
The shift to Direct-to-Patient telehealth is in its nascent stage, and we believe we have developed the internal infrastructure, medical expertise, and industry know-how to capitalize on the opportunity to penetrate this large, open, and growing market.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have achieved rapid growth since our transformation into a healthcare focused company in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate in revenue of nearly 173% since 2019 and growth accelerating to 149% in 2021 as compared to 2020. We believe this validates our significant long-term investments in developing our human capital, technology, brand-awareness, operations, and customer acquisition. Our continued investment in, and expansion of, our core brands and their offerings will further create opportunities to acquire new customers and increase the lifetime value of our customers.

We continue to invest heavily in the experience our customers have with our products and their overall satisfaction with our products and our company, and we expect customer repurchase rates and overall customer retention to grow further as we allocate more resources and focus to this component of the business. While we are proud of our accomplishments to date, we believe the most exciting opportunities for our growth story are ahead of us, and we intend to pursue the following strategies to help us achieve this growth.
 
Continue to Grow Our Market Share in Indications We Already Treat 
 
There remains a large and unaddressed market within primary care, hair loss, erectile dysfunction, men’s health, dermatology, and in allergies and asthma into which we intend to continue to aggressively scale in 2022 and beyond. We plan to continue to build a robust operational infrastructure to enable us to not only provide better patient care, but drive better unit economics for our business.
Expand Into New Indications
 
We intend to leverage our infrastructure to launch new offerings within and around our existing brands. A multitude of opportunities exist to expand our product offerings under our current brand portfolio, and we plan to deploy new products and services in 2022 and beyond that will meet the needs of our existing customer base while enabling us to attract new customer patients across a broader range of indications.
Pursue Opportunities for Joint Ventures, Partnerships, and Inorganic Growth Initiatives 
 
We believe that our business model – direct-to-patient telehealth – will be disruptive to the world of traditional healthcare services, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and diagnostics. Our proven ability to launch and scale telehealth offerings in a capital-efficient manner will likely be valuable to organizations in the traditional healthcare market segment seeking to take advantage of this new delivery model. We believe we are well-positioned to form joint ventures and additional partnerships with existing traditional healthcare companies, and we are actively exploring avenues and partners for new ventures.
Drive Continued Operational Excellence
 
We are committed to improving productivity and profitability through a number of operational initiatives designed to grow our revenue and expand our margins. Overall, we expect that business profitability will be driven by continued net revenue growth in conjunction with gross margin improvements, continued marketing efficiencies, and generating operating leverage. We believe there is opportunity for continued improvement in gross margins, marketing efficiencies, and operating leverage through these key initiatives:
Optimize Price
 
Through investment in human capital and technology, we intend to continue building a data-based understanding of price elasticity dynamics, promotional strategies and other price management tools to drive optimized pricing for us and our partners. Based on the strength of our brands and the value proposition of our products, we believe we have pricing power in the market that will only increase through economies of scale.
Reduce Product Returns
 
We continue to evolve our return policies and believe we have the opportunity to further reduce customer return rates. We have identified several opportunities that span policy change, process improvement, and consumer education to reduce return rates and increase overall customer satisfaction.
Invest in Supply Chain
 
We plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to meet the requirements of our growing business. Our supply chain is instrumental to both supporting growth and improving business performance. While we currently partner with several third-party manufacturing and logistics companies, physician networks, and prescription medication fulfillment companies, we are evaluating opportunities to further build our own internal capabilities in these areas.

We anticipate that growth of our products and services will span entirely new markets in healthcare, including:
 
● Services and Content: We plan to offer services that provide customers the opportunity to interact with telehealth in new ways, including digital apps, counseling and family consultations.
 
● Use Cases: We believe we can broaden the range of use cases addressed by market need, including the treatment of new conditions with the launch of new brands and the expansion of existing brand offerings to covering complementary clinical indications.
 
Competition
 
The markets we sell into are large and highly competitive. Numerous online brands compete with us for customers throughout the U.S. and internationally in the hair loss, immune support, men’s health, dermatology, primary care, allergy, and document management verticals. We also compete with traditional mass merchandisers, drug store chains, and independent pharmacies.
 
Our competitors include, among others, Teledoc, Ro, Thirty Madison, Inc., Icebreaker Health, Inc., Hims & Hers Health, Inc., and GoodRx, Inc. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us, have longer operating histories, higher visibility and brand recognition, and have materially greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to successfully compete with them in the marketplace.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We take a patient-centric approach to telehealth, with a strong emphasis on the quality-of-care we deliver to our patients. Our human capital and know-how, proprietary technology platform, and unique product offerings represent meaningful strengths that we believe will enable us to maintain and grow our market-leading position in the U.S.
 
Our key competitive strengths include:
 
High-Quality Care
 
Our telehealth platform is designed to give consumers more control over their healthcare spending; greater convenience in how and when they pursue or receive care; and better outcomes as hurdles to healthcare services are removed for the care or medications patients need. We are committed to exceptional care and an exceptional customer service experience for patients and customers.
 
Direct-To-Consumer Know-How
 
We actively seek to acquire, license, and develop brands and products with large, untapped e-commerce potential and proven business models. We acquire our patients in an efficient manner through an omni-channel marketing approach that includes digital advertising through platforms like Facebook and Google, social media platforms, as well as more traditional media channels like television and radio. Since our inception in 2015, we have invested heavily in recruiting experts in direct response marketing and customer acquisition.
 
Proprietary and Scalable Technology Platform
 
Our in-house telehealth infrastructure is continually being improved as we scale, and this flexible infrastructure can be repurposed for any variety of existing or future telehealth brands. This flexible platform allows for rapid development and scale of new telehealth brands as we identify attractive specialty verticals. Additional key capabilities of this platform include proprietary staffing algorithms for case-load balancing, full CRM functionality, integration with an affiliated 50 state physician network, national third-party pharmacy network, fully integrated electronic medical record system, synchronous and asynchronous communications, and more.
 
● Patient Care Center: We launched a dedicated patient care center in November 2020 staffed by LifeMD employees, which includes approximately 135 employees and is led by an experienced operations and customer experience team. We believe the hands-on capabilities of the patient care center will continue to drive high levels of patient satisfaction across our telehealth platforms.
 
● Drive Marketing Efficiencies: Marketing investments are the result of a disciplined process and are measured against both growth and profitability targets. As we continue to grow and scale, we believe we will continue to improve the efficiency of our marketing investments and improve our return on advertising spend. As our budgets and pool of talent continues to grow, we believe this will result in cheaper media rates and improvements to our proprietary models that inform the strategic decisions that drive product offerings, customer acquisition, retention, and brand awareness.

Management Team
 
Our management team has deep experience in healthcare services, technology, finance, and direct-to-consumer and traditional advertising such that we believe we are uniquely positioned to expand our patient-base while providing quality services and product offerings at efficient customer-acquisition costs.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection and confidentiality, patents, and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain proprietary rights, technologies or copyrighted materials from third-parties, and we rely on those third-parties to defend their proprietary rights, copyrights, and technologies.


From time-to-time, we register our principal brand names in the United States and certain foreign countries. Our material trademarks include ShapiroMD Hair Growth Experts® and Cleared®. Trademark applications have been filed and are being prosecuted for RexMD, LifeMD and NavaMD. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights in our brand names may not be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our brand names in the United States or abroad. Existing trademark laws afford only limited practical protection for our product lines. The laws and the level of enforcement of such laws in certain foreign countries where we market our products often do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
We rely primarily on proprietary trade secrets and extensive experience to operate our online direct response marketing platform. We have two U.S. patents relating to our Shapiro MD products’ method for treatment of hair loss with a combination of natural ingredients with one granted on March 24, 2015 and the other on January 3, 2017. In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors to contractually protect such information.
 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
We use third parties to manufacture and package our OTC products according to the formulas and packaging guidelines we dictate. In order to minimize costs, we may elect to purchase raw or bulk materials directly from our suppliers and have them shipped to our manufacturers so that we may incur only tableting, encapsulating, and/or packaging costs and avoid the additional costs associated with purchasing the finished product.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) 
 
Our business is heavily regulated by the FDA and the FTC. The FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws. Our hair loss products are regulated as cosmetics under the FDCA.
 
The FDA imposes Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) guidelines to ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. GMP guidelines include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing, and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients, and finished products and record keeping and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters, and to institute criminal proceedings.

Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
 
Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our operations and those of our partners are subject to federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the practice of medicine, telehealth and the prescribing of prescription medications. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our prices are accurate and relevant, and reach and advertise to consumers with savings information. We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical and marketing purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we may use third party service providers to assist us in the above.
 
We endeavor to treat our consumers’ data with respect and maintain consumer trust. We provide consumers options designed to allow them to control the use and disclosure of their data, such as allowing consumers to opt out of any marketing requests, opt out of the use of marketing cookies, pixels and technologies on our platform, and request deletion of their data.
 
Since we receive, use, transmit, disclose and store personally identifiable information, including health-related information, we are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed on November 3, 2020 and will enter into force on January 1, 2023, with a look-back to January 2022. The CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty.
 
Additionally, the FTC, and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.
 
In addition, HIPAA, which we believe does not currently apply to most of our business as currently operated, imposes on entities within its jurisdiction, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Although the consumers who use our offerings do so outside of any medication or other health benefits covered under their health insurance, including any commercial or government healthcare program, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
 
The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 
State Licensing Requirements
 
Certain states have enacted laws regulating companies that offer and market discount medical plans, including prescription drug plans, subscription membership programs, or discount cards, such as our prescription offering. These state laws are intended to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair, or deceptive marketing, sales and enrollment practices by such plans. It is possible that other states may enact new requirements or interpret existing requirements to include our programs. Failure to obtain the required licenses, certifications or registrations to offer and market these subscription discount programs may result in civil penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders, or a restructuring of our operations.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
 
With respect to our telehealth platform, we contract with our physician-owned professional corporation, LifeMD PC, to deliver our telehealth offerings to its patients in the United States. We entered into a management services agreement with LifeMD PC pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services. In addition, our platform enables consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering and/or fill their prescriptions through a third-party mail-order pharmacy. These relationships are subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 232 employees, of which 196 were full-time, 2 were part-time, and 34 were temporary employees. Of our total employees, 135 were based at our patient care center in Greenville, SC. We use the services of consultants and third-party service providers, where needed. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
We expect headcount to continue to grow in the future, especially as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions, in various functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company, and to support our continued growth. We pride ourselves on hiring people who not only have the skills required to perform their respective roles, but also share in the Company’s mission.
 
To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program for key executive officers and other employees. We also provide comprehensive benefits, including health insurance for employees and dependents, 401(k) match for employees and unlimited paid time off for exempt employees. In managing our business, we strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. Our employees are supported with training to ensure compliance with our policies. We adhere to our business code of conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect.
 
COVID-19 Response
 
On March 11, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S. health care system. In response to COVID-19, our senior leadership assessed the impact across our entire team. Our objective was to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities we service. Our response to COVID-19 and financial performance in 2021 was a direct result of the dedication and strength of our team members and our strong culture.
