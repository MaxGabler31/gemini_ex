  Business Overview
  
 Voltari Corporation ("Voltari" the "Company" “we,” “our” or “us”), a Delaware corporation, is in the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real properties. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own three commercial real properties. One property is in Long Branch, New Jersey, which we lease to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) pursuant to a triple net lease. The second property is in Flanders, New York, which we lease to 7-Eleven Corporation ("7-Eleven") pursuant to a double net lease. The third property is in Columbia, South Carolina, which is leased to the McClatchy Company (“McClatchy”) pursuant to a triple net lease. All of our revenue is derived from the rental income we receive under these three leases. Future acquisitions are intended to be initially financed through borrowings available under our $30 million Amended Note (as defined herein) with Koala (as defined herein). The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to “double net” or “triple net” leases.
  
 Voltari was originally incorporated under the name “Mobile Systems Corp.” on December 14, 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Motricity, Inc. (“Motricity”), and changed its name to “Voltari Corporation” on January 16, 2013. On April 9, 2013, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization by and among Motricity, Voltari and Voltari Merger Sub, Inc. and intending to protect the long-term value of Motricity’s net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"), Motricity became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Voltari (the “Reorganization”). For purposes of Rule 12g-3(a), we are the successor issuer to Motricity.
 
  Recent Developments — On December 7, 2018, High River Limited Partnership (“High River”), an entity affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, our controlling stockholder, and its affiliates (collectively with High River, the “Icahn Affiliates”) beneficial owners of approximately 52.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 98.0% of our outstanding shares of 13% Redeemable Series J Preferred Stock, made an offer to purchase the remaining shares of the Company’s common stock in a merger transaction for $0.58 per share in cash (the “Offer”). As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 10, 2019, the Board subsequently formed a special committee of independent directors to consider the Offer. On February 19, 2019, the Icahn Affiliates increased their offer to $0.68 per share in cash, on February 25, 2019, they increased their offer to $0.80 per share in cash and on March 5, 2019, they further increased their offer to $0.86 per share in cash, each subject to the same conditions as set forth in the original offer letter.
 
 There can be no assurance that an agreement with High River or any other party will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated. The pendency of the Offer for an extended period of time, as well as the failure to consummate a transaction with High River or any other party, may have a negative impact on our ability to effectively execute our business plans. If a transaction is approved and consummated, we would no longer be a public company and common stockholders would no longer be able to participate in any of our future earnings or growth.
  
  Transformation Plan—The Company had previously been engaged in the business of providing mobile marketing and advertising solutions to brands, marketers and advertising agencies. In August 2015, we began implementing a transformation plan pursuant to which, among other things, we exited our mobile marketing and advertising business and entered into the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real estate properties. The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to so-called “double net” or “triple net” leases. The Company has significantly reduced its workforce in connection with its transformation plan. The Board believes that, if successfully implemented, the Company can, over time, generate profits from the transformation plan.

  Real Estate Investment
  
 The Company is in the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real properties. The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to so-called “double net” or “triple net” leases. Future acquisitions are intended to be initially financed through borrowings available under our $30 million Amended Note with Koala. See Note 5 - Liquidity and Capital Resources to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
  
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have completed three real estate acquisitions. Until and unless we acquire additional properties, the rental payments associated with our three properties will represent the sole source of our revenues. The termination of the leases associated with these properties or our failure to maintain our leases on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.
  
  Properties
  
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own three commercial real properties. All of our revenue is derived from the rental income we receive under the leases associated with these three properties.
  
 The Long Branch property is located at 160 Brighton Avenue, City of Long Branch, New Jersey (the "Long Branch Property") and has a retail bank branch building situated thereon. The original term of the lease expires in June 2020 (with two, five-year renewal options). Pursuant to the lease, Chase is responsible for the payment of basic rent as well as the payment of real estate taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, tenant's insurance and other property related costs.

  Competition
  
 The commercial real estate industry is highly competitive, and we will face competition from many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.

  Financing Arrangements
  
 On August 7, 2015, we, as borrower, and Koala Holding LP (“Koala”), as lender, an affiliate of Mr. Carl C. Icahn, the Company’s controlling stockholder, entered into a $10 million revolving loan facility (the “Prior Note") at a rate equal to the greater of the LIBOR rate plus 350 basis points, per annum, and 3.75%, per annum, plus a fee of 0.25% per annum on undrawn amounts. The Company sought and received the Prior Note to, in part, allay potential concerns regarding the Company’s ability to invest in and execute its transformation plan while retaining cash levels sufficient to fund its ongoing operations. There were no limitations on the use of proceeds under the Prior Note. As collateral for the Prior Note, we pledged and granted to Koala a lien on our limited liability company interest in Voltari Holding. 
  
 Our Board formed a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to negotiate the structure and terms of the Prior Note. The Special Committee consisted of James L. Nelson, a former member of our Board, and Jay A. Firestone. In connection with its negotiation of the structure and terms of the Prior Note, the Special Committee retained and received advice from its own legal counsel as well as an independent financial advisor. The Special Committee received an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the financial terms of the Prior Note were fair, from a financial point of view, to us. The Special Committee approved the terms and conditions of, and our entry into, the Prior Note.
 
 
On March 29, 2017, we and Koala amended and restated the Prior Note (the “Amended Note”). Pursuant to the Amended Note, Koala made available to the Company a revolving loan facility of up to $30 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Commitment”). The Company may, by written notice to Koala, request that the Commitment be increased (the “Increased Commitment”), provided that the aggregate amount of all borrowings, plus availability under the aggregate Increased Commitment, shall not exceed $80 million. Koala has no obligation to provide any Increased Commitment and may refuse to do so in its sole discretion.  
 The Amended Note provides that the net proceeds thereunder in excess of $10 million will be used by the Company for the acquisition, improvement, development, modification, alteration, repair, maintenance, financing or leasing of real property, including any fees and expenses associated with such activities. In connection with the negotiation of the structure and terms of the Amended Note, the Board, which at the time consisted entirely of independent directors, retained and received advice from its own legal counsel as well as an independent financial advisor. The Board received an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the financial terms of the Amended Note are fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company. The Board approved the terms and conditions of, and the Company’s entry into, the Amended Note.
  
 Borrowings under the Amended Note will bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Amended Note) plus 200 basis points, per annum, subject to a maximum rate of interest of 3.75%, per annum. The Amended Note matures on the earliest of (i) December 31, 2020, (ii) the date on which any financing transaction, whether debt or equity, is consummated by the Company (or its successors and assigns) with net proceeds in an amount equal to or greater than $30 million, and (iii) at the Company’s option, a date selected by the Company that is earlier than December 31, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”). The Amended Note also allows the Company to, upon written notice to Koala not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, request that Koala extend the Maturity Date to December 31, 2022. Koala may, in its sole discretion, agree to extend the Maturity Date by providing written notice to the Company on or before the date that is 20 days prior to the Maturity Date. 
  
 If an event of default (as defined in the Amended Note) exists, the Amended Note will bear interest at a default rate equal to the greater of the LIBOR Rate plus 300 basis points, per annum, and 4.5%, per annum. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended Note, the Company may repay all or any portion of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Note at any time without premium or penalty. The amounts available under the Commitment or Increased Commitment, as the case may be, will increase and decrease in direct proportion to repayments and reborrowing’s under the Amended Note, respectively, from time to time. As collateral for the Amended Note, the Company has pledged and granted to Koala a lien on the Company’s limited liability company interest in Voltari Holding.
  
 As of December 31, 2018, borrowings under the Amended Note equaled $23.0 million. The outstanding balance, including interest of $1.0 million, totaled $24.0 million.
