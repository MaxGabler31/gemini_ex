ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
 
General Overview
 
We were incorporated on July 8, 2021 as an Oklahoma corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
 
On May 11, 2022, G. Reed Petersen Irrevocable Trust (the “Seller”), agreed to sell all 1,000 issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Shares of the Company to Reddington Partners LLC (the “Purchaser”), thus constituting a change of control of the Company, for $495,000, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). The Preferred Shares were convertible into 10,000,000 common shares which, upon conversion, represent approximately 98.7% of the Company’s outstanding common shares.
 
The sale of the Shares to the Purchaser was completed on May 17, 2022. As part of the Stock Purchase Agreement, G. Reed Petersen agreed to resign as the Company’s sole officer and director; and the change of management was completed on June 5, 2022. On June 6, 2022, Henrik Rouf became the Company’s sole officer and director.
 
Current Business
 
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. We are currently a “shell,” as that term is defined pursuant to Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our only activities for the period from July 8, 2021 (inception) through July 31, 2022 were organizational activities, preparing and filing a Form 10 with the SEC, and then identifying a target company for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
Employees
 
We have no full-time employees. Our sole officer and director works without compensation, devoting such hours as are required for corporate compliance and searching for a suitable acquisition or acquisitions.
