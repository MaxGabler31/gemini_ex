ITEM 1. BUSINESS
FORMATION OF OUR COMPANY
We are an externally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company incorporated in Maryland that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We commenced operations on May 24, 2013 and completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on September 30, 2013. We are managed by Mount Logan Management LLC, an investment adviser that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and BC Partners Management LLC provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We offer customized financing to business owners, management teams and financial sponsors for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth initiatives. We invest in first lien loans, and, to a lesser extent, second lien loans and equity securities issued by lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies.
We were formed for the purpose of: (i) acquiring, through a series of transactions, an investment portfolio from the following entities: CapitalSouth Partners Fund I Limited Partnership (“Fund I”); CapitalSouth Partners Fund II Limited Partnership (“Fund II”); CapitalSouth Partners Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III Parent”); CapitalSouth Fund III, L.P. (f/k/a CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund III, L.P.) (“Fund III”) and CapitalSouth Partners Florida Sidecar Fund I, L.P. (“Florida Sidecar” and, collectively with Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and Fund III Parent, the “Legacy Funds”); (ii) raising capital in the IPO and (iii) continuing and expanding the business of the Legacy Funds by making additional debt and equity investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies.
On September 24, 2013, we acquired 100% of the limited partnership interests in Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar and each of their respective general partners, as well as certain assets from Fund I and Fund III Parent, in exchange for an aggregate of 8,974,420 shares of our common stock (the “Formation Transactions”). Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar became our wholly owned subsidiaries. Fund II and Fund III retained their small business investment company (“SBIC”) licenses, continued to hold their existing investments at the time of the IPO and have continued to make new investments. The IPO consisted of the sale of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of $74.25 million, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions totaling $4.0 million and offering expenses totaling $1.75 million. The other costs of the IPO were borne by the limited partners of the Legacy Funds. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Florida Sidecar transferred all of its assets to us, and was legally dissolved as a standalone partnership. On March 1, 2019, Fund II repaid its outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA (“SBA-guaranteed debentures”) and relinquished its SBIC license. On June 10, 2021, Fund III repaid its SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. As of December 31, 2021, there were no SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.
 The Company has formed and expects to continue to form certain consolidated taxable subsidiaries (the “Taxable Subsidiaries”), which are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to make equity investments in companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code.
Capitala Business Lending, LLC (“CBL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was established on October 30, 2020, for the sole purpose of holding certain investments pledged as collateral under a senior secured revolving credit agreement with KeyBank National Association (the “KeyBank Credit Facility”). The financial statements of CBL are consolidated with those of Logan Ridge Finance Corporation.

Reverse Stock Split
 On July 30, 2020, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock. Accordingly, on August 3, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the “Articles of Amendment”) to its Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland to effectuate a one-for-six reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the Company’s shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Shares”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 21, 2020 (the “Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, every six (6) issued and outstanding Shares were converted into one (1) Share. The Articles of Amendment also provided that there was no change in the par value of $0.01 per Share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
 No fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and fractional shares of common stock were eliminated by paying cash for the fair value of a fractional portion of Shares. The Reverse Stock Split applied to all of the Company’s outstanding Shares and therefore did not affect any shareholder’s relative ownership percentage.
 Definitive Agreement
 On April 20, 2021, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC (“Capitala”), the Company’s former investment adviser, entered into a definitive agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”) with the Investment Advisor and Mount Logan Capital Inc. (“MLC”), both affiliates of BC Partners Advisors L.P. (“BC Partners”) for U.S. regulatory purposes, whereby Mount Logan acquired certain assets related to Capitala’s business of providing investment management services to the Company (the “Transaction”), through which the Investment Advisor became the Company’s investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) with the Company. At a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) held on May 27, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. The transactions contemplated by the Definitive Agreement closed on July 1, 2021 (the “Closing”).
 As part of the Transaction, the Investment Advisor entered into a two-year contractual fee waiver (the “Fee Waiver”) with the Company to waive, to the extent necessary, any capital gains fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceeds what would have been paid to Capitala in the aggregate over such two-year period under the prior advisory agreement.
 On the date of the Closing, the Company changed its name from Capitala Finance Corp. to Logan Ridge Finance Corporation and on July 2, 2021, the Company’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LRFC.”
 On July 1, 2021, in connection with the Closing, the Company’s then-current interested directors and the Company’s then-current independent directors resigned as members of the Board and Ted Goldthorpe, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, along with Alexander Duka, George Grunebaum, and Robert Warshauer, were appointed as members of the Board (the “Directors”). The Directors were appointed by the Board to fill the vacancies created by the resignations described above and the Directors were appointed to the class of directors as determined by the Board in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents. The Company’s stockholders will have the opportunity to vote for each of the Directors when his class of directors is up for reelection.
 All of the Company’s then-current officers resigned at the Closing and the Board appointed Ted Goldthorpe as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and President, Jason Roos as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Patrick Schafer as the Company’s Chief Investment Officer and David Held as the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer. On November 9, 2021, Jason Roos was replaced as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by Brandon Satoren, who was also appointed as Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Roos continues to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure
•Our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage and deploy capital. 
 •We depend upon Mount Logan Management LLC’s key personnel for our future success. 
 •We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. 
 •Any inability of Mount Logan Management LLC to maintain or develop strong referral relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 
 •Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility. 
 •Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.
 •We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us, and the calculation of our base management fee, which is based upon our gross assets, may have the effect of encouraging our Investment Advisor to utilize leverage when it may not be advisable to do so. 
 •A disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could impair our ability to raise capital and negatively affect our business. 
 •Adverse developments in the credit markets may impair our ability to secure debt financing. 
 •Inflation may adversely affect our business and operations and those of our portfolio companies.
 •Disruptions to the global supply chain may have adverse impact on our portfolio companies and, in turn, harm us.
 •We will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax if we are unable to qualify or maintain our RIC tax treatment under the Code. 
 •Mount Logan Management LLC is not obligated to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on accrued income that we never receive. 
 •Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that are costly and could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 •Internal and external cyber threats, as well as other disasters, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. 
 •Economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies. 
 •Events outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect our portfolio companies and our results of our operations. 
 Risks Related to our Investments
•Our investments are very risky and highly speculative. 
 •An investment strategy focused primarily on smaller privately held companies involves a high degree of risk and presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. 
 •Our investments in leveraged portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 •The health and performance of our portfolio companies could be adversely affected by political and economic conditions in the countries in which they conduct business. 
 •We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. 
 •The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 
 •Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. 
 •Our ability to enter into new transactions with our affiliates, and to restructure or exit our investments in portfolio companies that we are deemed to “control” under the 1940 Act, will be restricted by the 1940 Act, which may limit the scope of investment opportunities available to us. 
 •Our portfolio may lack diversification among portfolio companies, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if one or more of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments. 
 •We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer. 
 •Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry in which a number of our investments are concentrated. 
 •Defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results. 
 •If our portfolio companies are unable to protect their proprietary, technological and other intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed, and if portfolio companies are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, the value of our investment could be reduced. 
 •Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution. 
 •Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity. 
 3


•We may not realize gains from our equity investments. 
 •Changes relating to the LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the value of our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities. 
 •We may choose to waive or defer enforcement of covenants in the debt securities held in our portfolio, which may cause us to lose all or part of our investment in these companies. 
 •Our investments in securities rated below investment grade are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. 
 •Our investments may be in portfolio companies which may have limited operating histories and financial resources. 
 Risks Relating to Our Securities
•The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. 
 •Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. 
 •Investing in our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk. 
 •We cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our common stock will not decline. 
 •Our common stockholders will bear the expenses associated with our borrowings, and the holders of our debt securities will have certain rights senior to our common stockholders. 
 •Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 •Shares of our common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so in the future. 
 •If the current period of capital market disruption and instability continues for an extended period of time, there is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive distributions consistent with historical levels or at all or that our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital. 
 •You may not receive distributions, or our distributions may decline or may not grow over time, and you will experience dilution in your ownership percentage if you opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan. 
 •We will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds of any successful offering of securities. 
 •The net asset value per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock. 
 •Your interest in Logan Ridge may be diluted if you do not fully exercise your subscription rights in any rights offering. 
 •If we issue preferred stock, the net asset value and market value of our common stock will likely become more volatile. 
 •Holders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of our Board and class voting rights on certain matters. 
 OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We expect the companies in which we invest will generally have between $5 million and $50 million in trailing twelve-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). We believe our focus on direct lending to private companies enables us to receive higher interest rates and more substantial equity participation. As part of that strategy, we may invest in first lien loans, which have a first priority security interest in all or some of the borrower’s assets. In addition, our first lien loans may include positions in “stretch” senior secured loans, also referred to as “unitranche” loans, which combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien loans, providing us with greater influence and security in the primary collateral of a borrower and potentially mitigating loss of principal should a borrower default. We also may invest in second lien loans, which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower’s assets. In addition to debt securities, we may acquire equity or detachable equity-related interests (including warrants) from a borrower. Typically, the debt in which we invest is not initially rated by any rating agency; however, we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “high yield” or “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. We intend to target investments that mature in four to six years from our investment.
We typically will not limit the size of our loan commitments to a specific percentage of a borrower’s assets that serve as collateral for our loan, although we attempt to protect against risk of loss on our debt investments by structuring, underwriting and pricing loans based on anticipated cash flows of our borrowers.
OUR INVESTMENT ADVISOR
We are managed by the Investment Advisor, whose investment team members have significant and diverse experience financing, advising, operating and investing in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. Mount Logan was formed in 2020 and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Mount Logan is controlled by MLC, a publicly listed Canada-based alternative asset management company. Mount Logan is an affiliate of BC Partners for U.S. regulatory purposes and BC Partners provides Mount Logan with personnel pursuant to a resource sharing agreement, which allows Mount Logan to utilize the resources of BC Partners' broader credit team.
MLC is managed by the founders of BC Partners Credit bringing to bear the investment expertise and deep resources of the broader BC Partners platform, all of which the Company - as an entity within the BC Partners ecosystem - benefits from. Mount Logan provides investment management services to privately offered investment funds and acts as the collateral manager to issuers of collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") backed by debt obligations and similar assets.
Mount Logan's investment committee, or the Mount Logan Investment Committee, includes Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer, Henry Wang and Raymond Svider, each experienced members of Mount Logan's investment personnel.
With approximately $40 billion in assets under management and offices in London, Paris, Hamburg, and New York, the BC Partners organization is comprised of a private equity platform, a credit platform, and a real estate platform. All three platforms operate as integrated businesses within the overall BC Partners organization. Founded in 1986, BC Partners grew and evolved with the development of the European private equity market, consistently maintaining its position as one of the leading
4


buyout firms in the region. It subsequently expanded investment operations to North America to support larger transactions operating more globally and established a successful investment platform for buyouts of businesses based in the United States and around the world. BC Partners expanded its strategic offering by establishing a credit platform in 2017 and a real estate platform in 2018. BC Partners has a 35-year investing track record across a variety of geographies and sectors. Throughout its investment history, BC Partners has built strong and longstanding relationships with global institutional investors.
To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and interpretation of the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Investment Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Advisor or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Advisor’s allocation procedures.
On October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to an affiliate of our Investment Advisor that allows BDCs managed by the Investment Advisor, including Logan Ridge, to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates, including BCP Special Opportunities Fund I LP, BC Partners Lending Corporation and any future funds that are advised by the Investment Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers.
 Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest in such investment opportunities with our affiliates if a ‘‘required majority’’ (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our directors each of which is not considered an “interested person”, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act (the “independent directors”) make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies.
INVESTMENTS
We will engage in various investment strategies from time to time in order to achieve our overall lending and investment objectives. Our strategies will generally require current cash yields and sensible leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and either a first or second lien position (subject to limited instances in which we will not obtain security) in the collateral of the portfolio company. The strategy we select will depend upon, among other things, market opportunities, the skills and experience of our Investment Advisor’s investment team, the result of our financial, operational and strategic evaluation of the opportunity, and our overall portfolio composition. Most of our existing debt investments offer, and we expect most of our future debt investments will offer, the opportunity to participate in a borrower’s equity performance through warrant participation, direct equity ownership or otherwise, and many of our debt investments will require the borrower to pay an early termination fee. Collectively, these attributes have been, and are expected to be, important contributors to the returns generated by our Investment Advisor’s investment team.
The Investment Advisor’s investment team uses a disciplined investment portfolio monitoring and risk management process that emphasizes strict underwriting standards and guidelines, strong due diligence investigation, regular portfolio review, analysis and performance-guided responses, and proper investment diversification. We allocate capital among different industries, geographies and private equity sponsors on the basis of relative risk/reward profiles as a function of their associated downside risk, volatility, perceived fundamental risk and our ability to obtain favorable investment protection terms.
Types of Investments
We will target debt investments that yield meaningful current income and, in many cases, provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through equity securities. In each case, the following criteria and guidelines are applied to the review of a potential investment; however, not all criteria are met in every single investment in our portfolio, nor do we guarantee that all criteria will be met in the investments we will make in the future.
 •Established Companies With Positive Cash Flow. We seek to invest in established companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows. We intend to focus on companies with a history of profitability and minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA of between $5 million and $50 million. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, distressed or “turn-around” situations or companies with business plans that we do not understand. 
 •Experienced Management Teams with Meaningful Investment. We seek to invest in companies in which senior or key managers have significant company or industry-level experience and have significant equity ownership. It has been our experience that these management teams are more committed to the company’s success and more likely to manage the company in a manner that protects our debt and equity investments. 
 •Significant Invested Capital. We believe that the existence of an appropriate amount of equity beneath our debt capital provides valuable support for our investment. In addition, the degree to which the particular investment is a meaningful one for the portfolio company’s financial sponsor, and the financial sponsor’s ability and willingness to invest additional equity capital as and to the extent necessary, are also important considerations. 
 •Appropriate Capital Structures. We seek to invest in companies that are appropriately capitalized. First, we examine the amount of equity that is being invested by the company’s private equity sponsor to determine whether there is a sufficient capital cushion beneath our invested capital. We also analyze the amount of leverage and the characteristics of senior debt with lien priority over our investment. 
 •Strong Competitive Position. We intend to invest in companies that have developed strong, defensible product or service offerings within their respective market segments. These companies should be well positioned to capitalize on organic and strategic growth opportunities and should compete in industries with strong fundamentals and meaningful barriers to entry. We further analyze prospective portfolio investments in order to identify competitive advantages within their respective industries, which may result in superior operating margins or industry-leading growth. 
 •Customer and Supplier Diversification. We expect to invest in companies with sufficiently diverse customer and supplier bases. We believe these companies will be better able to endure industry consolidation, economic contraction and increased competition than those that are not sufficiently diversified. However, we also recognize that from time to time, an attractive investment opportunity with some concentration among its customer base or supply chain will present itself. We believe that concentration issues can be evaluated and, in some instances (whether due to supplier or customer product or platform diversification, the existence and quality of long-term agreements with such customers or suppliers or other select factors), mitigated, thus presenting a superior risk-adjusted pricing scenario. 
 Debt Investments
The Investment Advisor’s investment team tailors the terms of each debt investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction, the needs of the prospective portfolio company and, as applicable, its financial sponsor, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. We expect our primary source of return to be the cash interest we will collect on our debt investments. We also typically
5


seek board observation rights with each portfolio company, and we offer (and have historically provided) managerial and strategic assistance to these companies. We seek to further protect invested principal by negotiating appropriate affirmative, negative and financial covenants in our debt documents that are conservative enough to represent a prudent cushion at closing or to budgeted projections, but that are flexible enough to afford our portfolio companies and their financial sponsors sufficient latitude to allow them to grow their businesses. Typical covenants include default triggers and remedies (including penalties), lien protection, leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, change of control provisions and put rights. Most of our debt investments feature call protection to enhance our total return on debt investments that are repaid prior to maturity.
Most of our debt investments are structured as first lien loans, and as of December 31, 2021, 73.6% of the fair value of our debt investments consisted of such investments. First lien loans may contain some minimum amount of principal amortization, excess cash flow sweep feature, prepayment penalties, or any combination of the foregoing. First lien loans are secured by a first priority lien in existing and future assets of the borrower and may take the form of term loans, delayed draw facilities, or revolving credit facilities. In some cases, first lien loans may be subordinated, solely with respect to the payment of cash interest, to an asset based revolving credit facility. Unitranche debt, a form of first lien loan, typically involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both senior secured and subordinated debt in one debt security, bifurcating the loan into a first-out tranche and last-out tranche. As of December 31, 2021, 8.5% of the fair value of our first lien loans consisted of last-out loans. We believe that unitranche debt can be attractive for many lower middle-market and traditional middle-market businesses, given the reduced structural complexity, single lender interface and elimination of intercreditor or potential agency conflicts among lenders.
We may also invest in debt instruments structured as second lien loans. Second lien loans are loans which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower’s assets, and in some cases, may be subject to the interruption of cash interest payments upon certain events of default, at the discretion of the first lien lender. On a fair market value basis, 22.6% of our debt investments consisted of second lien loans as of December 31, 2021.
Some of our debt investments have payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, which is a form of interest that is not paid currently in cash but is accrued and added to the loan balance until paid at the end of the term. While we generally seek to minimize the percentage of our fixed return that is in the form of PIK interest, we sometimes receive PIK interest due to prevailing market conditions that do not support the overall blended interest yield on our debt investments being paid in all-cash interest. As of December 31, 2021, our weighted average PIK yield was 0.1%. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average annualized cash yield on our debt portfolio was 9.4%. In addition to yield in the form of current cash and PIK interest, some of our debt investments include an equity component, such as a warrant to purchase a common equity interest in the borrower for a nominal price.
The weighted annualized yield is calculated based on the effective interest rate as of period end, divided by the fair value of our debt investments. The weighted average annualized yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.
Equity Investments
When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity participation in the form of detachable warrants to purchase common equity in the company in the same class of security that the owners or equity sponsors receive upon funding. In addition, we may make non-control equity co-investments in conjunction with a loan transaction with a borrower. The Investment Advisor’s investment team generally seeks to structure our equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and, to the extent available, event-driven put rights. They also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include “piggyback” registration rights. In addition to warrants and equity co-investments, our debt investments in the future may contain a synthetic equity position.
INVESTMENT PROCESS
The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of Mount Logan and the Logan Ridge investment team (the "LRFC Investment Team"). All investment decisions require the majority approval of the Mount Logan Investment Committee. The LRFC Investment Team sources, identifies and diligences investment opportunities and presents the opportunity to the Mount Logan Investment Committee for approval. The Mount Logan Investment Committee is currently comprised of three members of BC Partners Credit ("BCP Credit") (Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer and Henry Wang), and one member of BC Partners Private Equity (Raymond Svider). The Mount Logan Investment Committee meets regularly to review the opportunities presented by the LRFC Investment Team. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Mount Logan's Investment Committee approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Mount Logan Investment Committee. The Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, oversees and monitors the investment performance and, beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the Investment Advisory Agreement, will annually review the compensation Logan Ridge pays to Mount Logan.
None of Mount Logan's investment professionals receive any direct compensation from Logan Ridge in connection with the management of Logan Ridge's portfolio.
The following individuals (the "LRFC Portfolio Managers") have senior responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio: Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer, Henry Wang, Raymond Svider and Patrick Schafer. Mr. Schafer is Logan Ridge's Chief lnvestment Officer and has primary responsibility for the day-to-day implementation and management of Logan Ridge's investment portfolio.
The stages of our investment selection process are as follows:
 Deal Generation/Origination
Deal generation and origination is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, service providers (such as lawyers and accountants), as well as current and former clients, portfolio companies and investors. 
Screening
All potential investments that are received are screened for suitability and consistency with our investment criteria (see “— Due Diligence and Underwriting,” below). In screening potential investments, our Investment Advisor’s investment team utilizes the same value-oriented investment philosophy they employed in their
6


work with the Legacy Funds and commits resources to managing downside exposure. If a potential investment meets our basic investment criteria, a deal team is assigned to perform preliminary due diligence. In doing so, we consider some or all of the following factors:
•A comprehensive financial model that we prepare based on quantitative analysis of historical financial performance, financial projections made by management or the financial sponsor, and pro forma financial ratios assuming an investment consistent with possible structures. In analyzing our model, we test various investment structures, pricing options, downside scenarios and other sensitivities in order to better understand potential risks and possible financial covenant ratios; 
 •The competitive landscape and industry dynamics impacting the potential portfolio company; 
 •Strengths and weaknesses of the potential investment’s business strategy and industry outlook; and 
 •Results of a broad qualitative analysis of the company’s products or services, market position and outlook, customers, suppliers and quality of management. 
 If the results of this preliminary due diligence are satisfactory, the deal team prepares an executive summary that is presented to our Investment Advisor’s investment committee in a meeting that includes all members of the portfolio and investment teams. This executive summary includes the following areas:
•Company history and summary of product(s) and/or service(s); 
 •An overview of investors, anticipated capital sources and transaction timing; 
 •Investment structure and expected returns, including initial projected financial ratios; 
 •Analysis of historical financial results and key assumptions; 
 •Analysis of the company’s business strategy; 
 •Analysis of the financial sponsor’s relevant experience or expected strategy; 
 •Investment strengths, weaknesses and priority issues to be addressed in due diligence; and 
 •Pro forma capitalization and ownership. 
 If our investment committee recommends moving forward, we will issue a non-binding term sheet or indication of interest to the potential portfolio company and, when applicable, its financial sponsor. If a term sheet is successfully negotiated, we will begin more formal due diligence and underwriting as we progress towards the ultimate investment approval and closing.
Due Diligence and Underwriting
The completion of due diligence deliverables is led by at least two investment professionals. However, all investment and portfolio team members are regularly updated with due diligence progress, especially any issues that emerge. The investment professionals leading the due diligence efforts are typically assigned to the original deal team that worked on the executive summary. However, post-term sheet deal teams sometimes contain one or more additional investment professionals and may include other professionals from business development, portfolio or other areas if a particular skill or experience set would be especially valuable in the due diligence process. The members of the underwriting team complete due diligence and analyze the relationships among the prospective portfolio company’s business plan, operations and expected financial performance. Due diligence consists of some or all of the following:
•On-site visits with management and relevant key employees; 
 •In-depth review of historical and projected financial statements, including covenant calculation work sheets; 
 •Interviews with customers and suppliers; 
 •Management background checks; 
 •Review of reports by third-party accountants, outside counsel and other industry, operational or financial experts, whether retained by us or the financial sponsor; 
 •Review of material contracts; and 
 •Review of financial sponsor’s due diligence package and internal executive summaries. 
 Typically, we utilize outside experts to analyze the legal affairs, accounting systems and financial results and, where appropriate, we engage specialists to investigate certain issues. During the underwriting process, significant, ongoing attention is devoted to sensitivity analyses regarding whether a company might bear a significant “downside” case and remain profitable and in compliance with assumed financial covenants. These “downside” scenarios typically involve assumptions regarding the loss of key customers and/or suppliers, an economic downturn, adverse regulatory changes and other relevant stressors that we attempt to simulate in our quantitative and qualitative analyses. Further, we continually examine the effect of these scenarios on financial ratios and other metrics.
During the underwriting process, the executive summary that was completed for the initial investment committee presentation is expanded upon into a full diligence memo and key findings are presented at subsequent, weekly meetings of the investment committee for continued discussion and, to the extent applicable, the investment committee issues new instructions to the underwriting team from the investment committee.
Approval, Documentation and Closing
The underwriting team for the proposed investment presents the full diligence memo and key findings from due diligence to the investment committee on an ongoing basis. Prior to the commencement of documentation, approval from the investment committee is sought and, if approved, the underwriting professionals heretofore involved proceed to documentation.
At all times during the documentation process, the underwriting professionals who conducted the due diligence remain involved; likewise, all extensively negotiated documentation decisions are made by the lead underwriting team member, in accordance with input from at least one investment committee member and guidance from outside counsel. As and to the extent necessary, key documentation challenges are brought before the investment committee for prompt discussion and resolution. Upon the completion of satisfactory documentation and the satisfaction of closing conditions, final approval is sought from the investment committee before closing and funding.

ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
Monitoring
Our Investment Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. We generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements, in each case, with management discussion and analysis and covenant compliance certificates, and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using the monthly financial statements, we calculate and evaluate all financial covenants and additional financial coverage ratios that might not be part of our covenant package in the loan documents. For purposes of analyzing a portfolio company’s financial performance, we may adjust their financial statements to reflect pro forma results in the event of a recent change of control, sale, acquisition or anticipated cost savings.
Our Investment Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, including the following:
 •Assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 •Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 •Comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 
 •Attendance at and participation in the board meetings; and 
 •Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 AGREEMENTS
Investment Advisory Agreement
On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) with the Investment Advisor, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 27, 2021. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until July 1, 2023, a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board or by a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, by a majority of our directors who are not "interested persons" as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act ("Independent Directors"). Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Investment Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Advisor:
 •determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio, and the manner of implementing such changes;
 •identifies, evaluates, and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
 •closes and monitors the investments we make; and
 •provides us with other investment advisory, research, and related services as we may from time to time require.
 The Investment Advisor’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Investment Advisor and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Investment Advisor’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as Investment Advisor for the Company.
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay the Investment Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee.
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of the gross assets, which are the total assets reflected on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and includes any borrowings for investment purposes. Although the Company does not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will not necessarily equal their notional value, will be included in the calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter.
The incentive fee consists of the following two parts:
 The first part of the incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income, and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, diligence, and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to our Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). The Company pays the Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to the pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
 •no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 2.0%;
 •100% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 8


(which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Investment Advisor with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and
 •20% of the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Advisor (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Advisor).
 The second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year, commencing on December 31, 2021, and will equal 20.0% of the Company’s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis with respect to each of the investments in the Company’s portfolio from the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from September 30, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company’s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 shall be excluded from the calculations of the capital gains fee. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains fee.
 The Company will defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by the Investment Advisor that would, when taken together with all other incentive fees paid to the Investment Advisor during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, exceed 20% of the sum of (a) the pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) the net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees will be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had incentive fees payable to the Investment Advisor of zero and $3.7 million related to fees earned in prior years but deferred under the incentive fee deferral mechanism.
 The Investment Advisor entered into a two-year contractual fee waiver (the “Fee Waiver”) with the Company to waive, to the extent necessary, any capital gains fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceeds what would have been paid to our prior investment advisor, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC, in the aggregate over such two-year period under the prior advisory agreement.
 Graphical Representation and Examples under the Investment Advisory Agreement
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to the Mount Logan Management LLC
 These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Advisor with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation under the Investment Advisory Agreement
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee*
Alternative 1:
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income − (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%
Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee.
Alternative 2:
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9%
9


Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income − (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2%

Incentive fee | = 100% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the “catch-up”(4)
 | = 100% × (2.2% − 2.0%) 
 | = 0.20% 

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the “catch-up” provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.20%.
Alternative 3:
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income − (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.80%

Incentive fee | = 20% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”(4) 
Incentive fee | = 100% × “catch-up” + (20% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income − 2.5%))
Catch-up | = 2.5% − 2.0% 
 | = 0.5% 
Incentive fee | = (100% × 0.5%) + (20% × (2.80% − 2.5%)) 
 | = 0.5% + (20%× 0.3%) 
 | = 0.5% + 0.06% 
 | = 0.56% 

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the “catch-up” provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.56%.

* The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets.
(1)Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 
 (2)Represents 2.00% annualized management fee. 
 (3)Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 
 (4)The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide the Investment Advisor with an incentive fee of 20% on all of Logan Ridge’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when its net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. 
 Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee
Alternative 1:
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) 
 •Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $32 million 
 •Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million 
 •Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million 
 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
•Year 1: None 
 10


•Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) 
 •Year 3: None 
 $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2).
•Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 
 $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains fee taken in Year 2).
Alternative 2:
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”) 
 •Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million 
 •Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million 
 •Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million 
 •Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million 
 The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be:
•Year 1: None 
 •Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee 
 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B).
•Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee(1)
$6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2.
•Year 4: None 
 •Year 5: 
 None $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3.

(1)As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 2 above, if the Company were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, the Company may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if the Company had been wound up on December 31 of such year. 
 Example 3: Application of the Incentive Fee Deferral Mechanism
Assumptions
•In each of Years 1 through 4 in this example pre-incentive fee net investment income equals $40.0 million per year, which we recognized evenly in each quarter of each year and paid quarterly. This amount exceeds the hurdle rate and the requirement of the “catch-up” provision in each quarter of such year. As a result, the annual income related portion of the incentive fee before the application of the deferral mechanism in any year is $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%). All income-related incentive fees were paid quarterly in arrears. 
 •In each year preceding Year 1, we did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses, no capital gain-related incentive fee was paid and there was no deferral of incentive fees. 
 •Year 1: We did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. 
 •Year 2: We realized a $30.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. 
 •Year 3: We recognized $5.0 million of unrealized capital depreciation and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. 
 •Year 4: We realized a $6.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses.

 Prior Investment Advisory Agreement
On September 24, 2013, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “Prior Investment Advisory Agreement”) with our Prior Investment Advisor, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC (“Capitala”), which was initially approved by the Board on June 10, 2013. As described in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed on May 4, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference, the terms of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement are substantially the same as those contained in the Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the reset of the capital gains incentive fee lookback feature to the date when Mount Logan assumed management of the Company
 Our Prior Investment Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Prior Investment Advisor managed our day-to-day operations, and provided investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of our Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, the Prior Investment Advisor:
•determined the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 •identified, evaluated and negotiated the structure of the investments we made (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); 
 •closed and monitored the investments we made; and 
 •provided us with other investment advisory, research and related services as we may have from time to time required. 
 The Prior Investment Advisor’s services under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement were not exclusive, and it was free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us were not impaired.
Pursuant to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, we agreed to pay the Prior Investment Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee.
 Prior Management Fee
The prior base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, which was our total assets as reflected on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and included any borrowings for investment purposes. Although we did not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which would not necessarily equal their notional value, would be included in our calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter.
Prior Incentive Fee
The prior incentive fee consists of the following two parts:
The first part of the prior incentive fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under an administration agreement between us and the prior administrator (the “Prior Administration Agreement”), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the prior incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income did not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, was compared
12


to a hurdle of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). We paid the Prior Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
•no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income did not exceed the hurdle of 2.0%; 
 •100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded the hurdle but was less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeded the hurdle but was less than 2.5%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” was meant to provide our Prior Investment Advisor with 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeded 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and 
 •20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) was payable to the Prior Investment Advisor (once the hurdle was reached and the catch-up was achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter was allocated to the Prior Investment Advisor). 
 The second part of the prior incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and would equal 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio.
The Company would defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by the Prior Investment Advisor that would, when taken together with all other prior incentive fees paid to the Prior Investment Advisor during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made, exceed 20% of the sum of (a) the pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) the net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees would be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment was payable under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement.
The Prior Investment Advisor voluntarily agreed to waive all or such portion of the quarterly incentive fees earned by the Prior Investment Advisor that would otherwise cause our quarterly net investment income to be less than the distribution payments declared by our Board. Quarterly prior incentive fees were earned by the Prior Investment Advisor pursuant to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement. Prior Incentive fees subject to the waiver could not exceed the amount of incentive fees earned during the period, as calculated on a quarterly basis. The Prior Investment Advisor would not be entitled to recoup any amount of prior incentive fees that it waived. The waiver was effective in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued through termination of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement.
Payment of Our Expenses
The investment team of our Investment Advisor and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Investment Advisor. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation):
•the cost of our organization; 
 •the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
 •the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our shares and other securities; 
 •interest payable on debt, if any, to finance our investments; 
 •fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments (such as legal, accounting, and travel expenses incurred in connection with making investments), including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and advisory fees; 
 •transfer agent and custodial fees; 
 •fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
 •costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and other applicable federal and state securities laws, and ongoing stock exchange listing fees;

 •all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of any costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer and their respective administrative support staff. 
 Duration and Termination
On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 27, 2021. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until July 1, 2023, a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board or by a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, by a majority of our directors who are not “"interested persons" as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act ("Independent Directors"). The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment.  The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other party. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Mount Logan Management LLC has the right to resign on 60 days’ notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within such time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.”

Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer, chief compliance officer and our allocable portion of the compensation of their respective administrative support staff. Under the Administration Agreement, our administrator will also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request such assistance. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect if approved annually by our Board. On July 1, 2021, we entered into the Administration Agreement. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. To the extent that our administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to our administrator. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement.
The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from Logan Ridge for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our administrator's services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for Logan Ridge.
 Prior Administration Agreement
The Prior Administration Agreement was initially approved by the Board on June 10, 2013 (the “Prior Administration Agreement”) and signed on September 24, 2013. The principal executive offices of our Prior Administrator, Capitala Advisors Corp., are located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. The Prior Administrator, pursuant to a sub-administration agreement, engaged U.S. Bank Global Fund Services to act on behalf of the Prior Administrator in its performance of certain administrative services for us. The principal office of U.S. Bank Global Fund Services is 777 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202. Pursuant to the Prior Administration Agreement, our prior administrator furnished us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Prior Administration Agreement, our Prior Administrator also performed, or oversaw the performance of, our required administrative services, which included, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders. In addition, our Prior Administrator assisted us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversaw the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversaw the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the Prior Administration Agreement were equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Prior Administrator’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Prior Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer, chief compliance officer and our allocable portion of the compensation of their respective administrative support staff. Under the Prior Administration Agreement, our Prior Administrator would also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that requested such assistance. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Prior Administration Agreement would remain in effect if approved annually by our Board. On July 30, 2020, the Board approved the renewal of the Prior Administration Agreement. The Prior Administration Agreement could be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. To the extent that our Prior Administrator outsourced any of its functions, we would pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to our Prior Administrator. Stockholder approval was not required to amend the Prior Administration Agreement.
Our Prior Administrator also provided administrative services to our Prior Investment Advisor. As a result, the Prior Investment Advisor would also reimburse our Prior Administrator for its allocable portion of our Prior Administrator’s overhead, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions for the Prior Investment Advisor, and its allocable portion of the compensation of any administrative support staff. The Prior Administration Agreement provided that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Prior Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it were entitled to indemnification from Logan Ridge for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Prior Administrator’s services under the Prior Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for Logan Ridge.
Prior License Agreement
We entered into a license agreement with the Prior Investment Advisor pursuant to which the Prior Investment Advisor agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Capitala.” Under this agreement, we had a right to use the Capitala name for so long as the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement with the Prior Investment Advisor was in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we had no legal right to the “Capitala” name.

Staffing
Logan Ridge has no employees. The Company is externally managed by the Investment Advisor, an affiliate of BC Partners, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Mr. Goldthorpe, an interested member of the Board, has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the Investment Advisor. The Investment Advisor is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. for U.S. regulatory purposes. MLC is the ultimate control person of the Investment Advisor.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, fees payable to the Investment Advisor equal (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fee. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares, and, in each case, a majority of the independent directors.
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company necessary for the operations of the Company, which include providing to the Company office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and such other services as the Administrator, subject to review by the Board, shall from time to time deem to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the applicable Administration Agreement. The Administrator also provides to the Company portfolio collection functions for and is responsible for the financial and other records that the Company is required to maintain and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to the Company’s stockholders and reports and all other materials filed with the SEC.
 For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the Company’s allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of its chief financial officer, and chief compliance officer, and their respective staffs.
VALUATION PROCESS AND DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter by subtracting our total liabilities from the fair value of our gross assets.
We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined, at all times consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange shall be valued at such price as of the closing price on the day of valuation. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined adequate, we use the quote obtained.
Securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of our Investment Advisor or the Board, does not represent fair value, which we expect will represent a substantial majority of the investments in our portfolio, shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; (iii) independent third-party valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals, review management’s preliminary valuations and prepare separate preliminary valuation conclusions on a selected basis such that each portfolio investment shall be independently reviewed at least annually (investments will not be selected for such review, however, if they (a) have a value as of the previous quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, or (b) have a value as of the current quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, after taking into account any repayment of principal during the current quarter); and (iv) the Board will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Advisor and, where appropriate, the respective third-party valuation firms.
The recommendation of fair value will generally be based on the following factors, as relevant:
•the nature and realizable value of any collateral; 
 •the portfolio company’s ability to make payments; 
 •the portfolio company’s earnings and discounted cash flow; 
 •the markets in which the issuer does business; and 
 •comparisons to publicly traded securities. 
 Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include, but are not limited to, the following:
•private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market; 
 •securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available; 
 •debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market; 
 •securities whose prices are stale; 
 •securities affected by significant events; and 
 •securities that the Investment Advisor believes were priced incorrectly. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.
 In making the good faith determination of the value of these securities, we start with the cost basis of the security, which includes the amortized original issue discount and PIK interest or dividends, if any. We prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also consult updates that we receive from senior management members at portfolio companies, whether solicited for valuation purposes, or received in the ordinary course of our portfolio monitoring or due diligence process. These updates include information such as industry trends, new product development or service offerings and other operational or strategic issues.
For debt securities that are not publicly traded or for which there is no market, we begin with our investment rating of the security as described above. Using this investment rating, we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale. The factors that may be taken into account in arriving at fair value include the following, as applicable: the portfolio company’s ability to service its interest and principal payment obligations, its estimated earnings
15


and projected discounted cash flows, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates, comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies, statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similarly situated securities, and other relevant factors.
As part of the valuation process, the audit committee reviews the preliminary evaluations prepared by the independent valuation firm engaged by the Board, as well as management’s valuation recommendations. Management and the independent valuation firm respond to the preliminary evaluation to reflect comments provided by the audit committee. The audit committee reviews the final valuation report and management’s valuation recommendations and makes a recommendation to the Board based on its analysis of the methodologies employed and the various weights that should be accorded to each portion of the valuation as well as factors that the independent valuation firm and management may not have considered in their evaluation process. The Board then evaluates the audit committee recommendations and undertakes a similar analysis to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to differ from the valuations assigned at any time. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the fair value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see “Risk Factors.”
Determinations in Connection with Offerings
In connection with certain future offerings of shares of our common stock, our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of shares of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made. Our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, will consider the following factors, among others, in making such a determination:
•the net asset value of shares of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC; 
 •our management’s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of shares of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of shares of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of shares of our common stock; and 
 •the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) net asset value of shares of our common stock, which is based upon the net asset value of shares of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management’s assessment of any material change in the net asset value of shares of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of shares of our common stock, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering. 
 Moreover, to the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price per share below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we provide in certain registration statements we file with the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the net asset value per share of our common stock fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances until the prospectus is amended, our Board will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current net asset value per share and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered.
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act.
COMPETITION
We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, private credit funds, mezzanine funds and other SBICs), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Additionally, competition for investment opportunities has emerged among alternative investment vehicles, such as collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and other BDCs, some of which are sponsored by other alternative asset investors, as these entities have begun to focus on making investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for our investment opportunities may intensify. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we will be able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of our experience and reputation, our willingness to make smaller investments than other specialty finance companies, the contacts and relationships of our Investment Advisor, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, and the investment terms we offer.
We believe that certain of our competitors may make first lien and second lien loans with interest rates and returns that will be comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we will target. Therefore, we will not seek to compete solely on the interest rates and returns that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.”
ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A RIC
As a BDC, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
TAXATION AS A RIC
For any taxable year in which we:
•qualify as a RIC; and 
 •satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, 
 16


we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary and capital gain net income that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Distribution Requirement”).
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 •derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and 
 •diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 •at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 •no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”). 
 Qualified earnings may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with Fund III or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees.
In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or other applicable IRS guidance.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
In addition, we will be partially dependent on Fund III for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Fund III may be limited by the SBIA, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for Fund III to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC tax treatment. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If Fund III is unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that we will qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement.
Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions.
17


Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35%. The U.S. has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders.
If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income (“passive foreign investment companies”), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on “excess distributions” received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability. In addition, under recently proposed regulations, income required to be included as a result of such an election would not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test unless we receive a distribution of such income from the passive foreign investment company in the same taxable year to which the inclusion relates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of “qualifying income” from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income.
FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC
If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets).
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for noncorporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
REGULATION
A BDC is regulated under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the U.S. for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be independent directors. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 150%, if certain conditions are met, after each issuance of senior securities. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement from 200% to 150% (i.e. the amount of debt may not exceed 66.7% of the value of our total assets), if certain requirements are met. On November 1, 2018, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) approved the application of the modified asset coverage. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities were changed from 200% to 150%, effective November 1, 2019.
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. On October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to an affiliate of our Investment Advisor that allows BDCs managed by the Investment Advisor, including Logan Ridge, to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Investment Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers. Under the terms of the exemptive order, in order for Logan Ridge to participate in a co-investment transaction, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Logan Ridge’s independent directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Logan Ridge and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of Logan Ridge or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of Logan Ridge’s stockholders and is consistent with Logan Ridge’s investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board. We believe this relief may not only enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies, but may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us in the absence of such relief.

We are generally not permitted to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.” We may, however, sell shares of our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which shares of our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.”
QUALIFYING ASSETS
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets”, unless, immediately after such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:
•Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company; 
 •Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and 
 •Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
 An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a SBIC wholly owned by a BDC) and that:
•does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made; 
 •is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board; 
 •does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; 
 •is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or 
 •meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. 
 Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC.
SIGNIFICANT MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS
Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies.
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC under the Code. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
SENIOR SECURITIES
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150%, if certain requirements are met, immediately after each such issuance. On June 10, 2014, we received an exemptive order from the SEC granting relief from the asset coverage requirements for certain indebtedness issued by Fund II and Fund III as SBICs. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.”

CODE OF ETHICS
We and our Investment Advisor have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our code of ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. Our code of ethics is also available on our website at www.loganridgefinance.com.
COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
We and our Investment Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. David Held currently serves as our chief compliance officer.
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 •pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 •pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. As a non-accelerated filer, we are not currently required to obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. 
 •pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Investment Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Investment Advisor and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the proxy voting policies and procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refers to the Investment Advisor.
Introduction
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies
We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients’ stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Our proxy voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our managing member any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Mount Logan Management LLC, LLC, 650 Madison Avenue, 23rd Floor, New York, New York 10022.
PRIVACY PRINCIPLES
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator).
We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Advisor and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.
