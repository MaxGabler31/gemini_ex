Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to RPT Realty, RPT Realty, L.P., and/or its subsidiaries, as the context may require. The content of our website and the websites of third parties noted herein in not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General
RPT Realty owns and operates a national portfolio of open-air shopping destinations principally located in top U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2018, our property portfolio consisted of 51 shopping centers (including one shopping center owned through a joint venture) representing 12.4 million square feet of gross leasable area.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company's aggregate portfolio was 94.3% leased.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 19 West 44th Street, New York, New York 10036 and its telephone number is (212) 221-1261. The Company’s website is rptrealty.com. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 95 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, RPT Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership.  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all owned properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 97.7% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.
Business Strategy
In 2018, the new executive management team set and met several key foundational objectives which included the streamlining of the organizational platform, resetting the company culture, conducting a strategic asset review that resulted in the decision to sell approximately $200 million of non-core assets, cultivating a redevelopment pipeline and changing the name of the Company to RPT Realty. The asset sale proceeds are expected to be re-allocated into the Company’s balance sheet to lower leverage, as well as fund its near-term accretive internal growth initiatives, including the reconfiguration of anchor boxes and the increasing of small shop occupancy.

Our goal is to be a dominant shopping center owner, with a focus on the following:

• | Own and manage high quality open-air shopping centers predominantly concentrated in the top U.S. metro areas;


• | Maintain value creation redevelopment and expansion pipeline;


• | Maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility; and


• | Retain motivated, talented and high performing employees.

Key methods to achieve our strategy:

• | Deliver above average relative shareholder return and generate outsized consistent and sustainable same property NOI and Operating FFO per share growth;


• | Pursue selective redevelopment projects with significant pre-leasing for which we expect to achieve attractive returns on investment;


• | Sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy and redeploy the proceeds to lease, redevelop and acquire assets in our core markets;


• | Achieve lower leverage while maintaining low variable interest rate risk; and


• | Retain access to diverse sources of capital, maintain liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit and minimize the amount of debt maturities in a single year.

Our portfolio consists of town center and urban-infill neighborhood and power center properties that include national chain store tenants, market-leading supermarket tenants, as well as a strong lineup of smaller national retailers to optimize the overall merchandise mix. Our centers also include entertainment components, including theaters, fitness centers and restaurants, which, in addition to supermarkets, are daily drivers of consumer traffic at our properties. National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and ULTA Salon. Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger, Aldi, and Sprouts. Theater, fitness and restaurant tenants include, among others, Regal Cinema, LA Fitness, Starbucks, Panera, and Rusty Bucket. Our shopping centers are primarily located in key growth markets in the 40 largest metropolitan markets in the United States such as Metro Detroit, Cincinnati, Southeast Florida, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Chicago, Tampa/Lakeland, Jacksonville, and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants' credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk.
During 2018, our consolidated properties reported the following leasing activity:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | Prior Rent/SF (2) | Tenant Improvements/SF (3) | Leasing Commissions/SF
Renewals | 173 | 969,782 | $17.80 | $16.87 | $1.24 | $0.16 
New Leases - Comparable | 22 | 142,339 | $13.24 | $9.27 | $15.07 | $7.48 
New Leases - Non-Comparable (4) | 93 | 495,131 | $15.59 | N/A | $43.51 | $6.45 
Total | 288 | 1,607,252 | $16.72 | N/A | $15.48 | $2.75 


(1) | Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term.


(2) | Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term.


(3) | Includes tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs. Excludes first generation space and new leases related to development and redevelopment activity. 


(4) | Non-comparable lease transactions include leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months and leases signed where the previous and current lease do not have a consistent lease structure. As a result, there is no comparable prior rent per square foot to compare to the base rent per square foot of the new lease.

Investing Activities and Significant Transactions
2

Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments. In addition we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria. We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership. We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings and leasing newly built space.
In January 2018, we acquired a 60,000 square foot leasehold interest in West Oaks, a shopping center in Novi, Michigan for $6.4 million. In addition, we sold six shopping centers and three land outparcels for gross proceeds of $125.1 million. Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost.  In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties and borrowing on an unsecured basis.  In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and REITs in general.  
Specifically, we completed the following financing transactions:
Debt
During 2018, our outstanding debt balance decreased by approximately $36.1 million, primarily through repayments on our revolving credit facility with the net proceeds received from disposed properties during the year. Refer to Note 8 for additional information related to our debt.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had $349.8 million and $318.7 million, respectively, available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants.
Equity
In June 2016, we terminated our previous controlled equity offering arrangement and commenced a new distribution agreement that registered up to 8.0 million common shares for issuance from time to time, in our sole discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not issue any common shares through either arrangement. The shares issuable in the new distribution agreement are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-211925).
Sustainability
We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability, with a focus on achieving goals in each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) areas of sustainability. We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of supporting our primary goal to maximize value for our shareholders. 
Our commitment to ESG principles starts with our employees. We are establishing a culture that intentionally attracts and retains talented employees to work in an engaging and energetic team environment that shares a passion for innovation, transparency and excellence. Our employees are awarded competitive compensation packages, including healthcare benefits for employees and their families, participation in a 401(k) plan, paid time-off benefits and employee referral bonuses. In addition, we have recently adopted “RPT Remote”, a flexible work initiative that allows employees the ability to telecommute one day per week. We are focused on creating healthy workspaces and promote health and wellness for our employees and their families. In 2018, we were recognized for winning Michigan’s Best and Brightest in Wellness for the fifth year in a row. The Best and Brightest in Wellness awards program honors organizations that are making their workplaces, their employees and the community a healthier place to live and work. We are also devoted to philanthropy initiatives and partner with organizations that are committed to improving the overall quality of life in our communities. Each month, we support a local community organization through charitable giving or volunteerism. 
In 2019, we intend to establish an environmental stewardship policy aimed at providing the necessary framework to commence comprehensive sustainability initiatives that meet our objectives of safeguarding the environment, while improving the energy efficiency of our portfolio and corporate office locations and lowering operating costs. We intend to establish measurable goals to reduce energy consumption, water usage and waste reduction across our portfolio and will report on actual performance in our environmental disclosures. Our New York City office is already a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certified location. LEED is an internationally recognized green building certification system, providing third-party verification

that a building or community was designed and built using strategies aimed at improving performance metrics that matter most: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts. We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance and will strive to enhance our disclosure using industry accepted measures.
