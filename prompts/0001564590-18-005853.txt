ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 We research and develop biopharmaceutical products, including those based on our patented DNA delivery technologies, for the prevention and treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases.
 We currently have three active development programs in the area of infectious disease comprised of:
  
• | An ongoing Phase 2 trial of our HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine, VCL-HB01, to treat patients with symptomatic genital herpes infection. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age who are randomized 2:1 to receive either vaccine or placebo. Recruitment of 261 subjects at 15 U.S. clinical sites was completed in April 2017 and dosing was completed in July 2017. Following the 4th vaccination, each subject entered a 12-month surveillance period during which each new lesion recurrence is assessed in the clinic by the investigator. After the last subject has completed a minimum of 9 months of surveillance, the primary endpoint of annualized recurrence rate will be calculated based on recurrences that are both clinically - and virologically - confirmed. This endpoint provides important information on the number of recurrences over time in this chronic disease setting and is clinically meaningful for both patients and treating physicians. We expect to deliver top-line results during the second quarter of 2018.

• | An ongoing Phase 2 trial of our novel antifungal VL-2397, for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis. The multicenter, open label randomized clinical study, will compare the efficacy and safety of VL-2397 to standard treatment for invasive aspergillosis in acute leukemia patients and recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The global Phase 2 trial will enroll approximately 200 patients and will be randomized on a 2:1 basis with approximately 134 patients treated with VL-2397 and 66 patients treated with a standard treatment course of their physician's choice of voriconazole, isavuconazole or liposomal amphotericin B. The patients in the VL-2397 arm will receive daily treatment with VL-2397 for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week course of physician’s choice of the comparator. The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality will be measured at 4 weeks and again at 6 weeks for the key secondary endpoint. The trial will be conducted at selected sites in North America, Europe and Asia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised that VL 2397 would be eligible for a Limited Use Indication (LUI) approval assuming a successful outcome of a single Phase 2 trial carried out in accordance with a protocol and statistical analysis plan consistent with the Agency's advice. The final determination whether the drug is approvable will be made by FDA after review of all relevant data. The LUI is a provision of the Limited Population Pathway established under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. The FDA has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for VL-2397 in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

• | An ongoing early stage development program of a novel treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection based on our DNA and lipid-delivery technologies. The initial stage of this program will be to demonstrate preclinical proof of concept for inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a mouse model in the second half of 2018. The ultimate aim of this program would be to demonstrate eradication of persistent HBV infection in CHB patients. This preclinical development effort is being conducted in collaboration with our strategic partner, AnGes, Inc. of Osaka, Japan.

Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website at www.vical.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make available copies of our news releases and other financial information about us on our website.
Our Core Technology
 The key discovery leading to our core DNA delivery technology was that muscle tissues can take up polynucleotide genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, directly, without the use of viral components or other delivery vehicles or technologies, and subsequently express the proteins encoded by the genetic material for periods ranging from weeks to more than a year. Our approach typically involves designing and constructing closed loops of DNA called plasmids. These 
 3

plasmids contain a DNA segment encoding the protein of interest, as well as short segments of DNA that control protein expression. Plasmids can be manufactured using uniform methods of fermentation and processing. This could result in faster development and production times than technologies that require development of product-specific manufacturing processes.
 Since the initial discovery of our DNA delivery technology, our researchers have improved the design of our plasmids to increase efficiency of gene expression and immunogenicity. We own broad patent rights in the United States and in key foreign markets to certain non-viral polynucleotide delivery technologies. Our patents and patent applications cover, for example, specific DNA constructs and formulations of gene-based product candidates, methods for producing pharmaceutical-grade DNA, and several families of lipid molecules and their uses in DNA delivery. Benefits of our DNA delivery technologies may include the following, which may enable us to offer novel treatment alternatives for diseases that are currently poorly addressed:
  
• | Broad Applicability. Our DNA delivery technologies may be useful in vaccines for infectious diseases, in which the expressed protein induces an immune response, and for therapeutic protein delivery, in which the expressed protein is a therapeutic agent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenience. Our DNA-based biopharmaceutical product candidates are intended to be administered on an outpatient basis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety. Our product candidates contain no infectious components that may cause unwanted immune responses, infections, or malignant and permanent changes in the targeted cells’ genetic makeup;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repeat Administration. Our product candidates contain no infectious components that may preclude multiple dosing with a single product or use in multiple products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacturing. Our DNA product candidates are manufactured using uniform fermentation and purification procedures; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost-Effectiveness. Our DNA delivery technologies may be more cost-effective than other approaches. They may also cause fewer potential side effects, which may reduce per patient treatment costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infectious Diseases
 We are focusing our development efforts on infectious disease indications. DNA vaccines use portions of the genetic code of a pathogen to cause the host to produce proteins of the pathogen that may induce an immune response. Compared with conventional vaccines that use live, weakened, or killed pathogens to produce an immune response, this method potentially offers superior safety and ease of manufacturing, as well as convenient storage and handling characteristics. DNA vaccines have the potential to induce potent T-cell responses against target pathogens as well as trigger production of antibodies. Over the past decade, many scientific publications have documented the effectiveness of DNA vaccines in contributing to immune responses in dozens of species, including fish, nonhuman primates and humans. We believe important steps in the validation of DNA vaccines occurred in 2005 when our licensee Aqua Health received Canadian approval to market its proprietary product, Apex®-IHN, a DNA vaccine to protect farm-raised salmon against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, or IHNV, and again in late 2009, when our licensee Merial received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to sell a therapeutic DNA vaccine, ONCEPT®, designed to aid in extending the survival time of dogs with oral melanoma.
 Vaccines are generally recognized as the most cost-effective approach for infectious disease healthcare. However, the technical limitations of conventional vaccine approaches have constrained the development of effective vaccines for many diseases. Development of vaccines based on conventional methods requires significant infrastructure in research and manufacturing. In addition, the safety risks associated with certain conventional vaccine approaches may offset their potential benefits. We believe our potential vaccine products may be simpler to manufacture than vaccines made using live viruses or protein subunit approaches, including those involving mammalian, avian or insect cell, or egg-based, culture procedures. In addition, our DNA delivery technologies may accelerate certain aspects of vaccine product development such as nonclinical evaluation and manufacturing.
 In the broader vaccine marketplace, it is important to note a changing dynamic. Traditionally, vaccines have been predominantly focused on the pediatric market, intended to protect children from diseases that could cause them serious harm. Today, there is a growing interest in vaccines against diseases that may affect adolescents and adults, which include both sexually transmitted diseases and infections that strike opportunistically, such as during pregnancy or in immunocompromised individuals. We believe our technologies, because of their potential safety and development timeline advantages, could be ideally suited for this new generation of vaccines.

Business Strategy
 There are two basic elements to our business strategy:
 Develop Products Independently
 We are currently focusing our resources on the development of our HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine and our antifungal drug candidate. The selection of targets for our development programs is driven by three key criteria: the complexity of the product development program, competition, and commercial opportunities. We intend to retain significant participation in the commercialization of any independently developed proprietary DNA vaccines and therapeutics that receive regulatory approval, although we may choose to enlist the support of partners to accelerate product development and commercialization.
 We are also focusing our resources on VL-2397, a therapeutic antifungal product candidate we in-licensed from Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”). We believe our technologies may lead to the development of novel preventive or therapeutic products for infectious disease targets. DNA vaccines may help combat diseases for which conventional vaccine methods have been unsuccessful. 
 Expand the Applications of Our Technologies through Strategic Collaborations
 We have collaborated with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and government agencies, providing us access to complementary technologies or greater resources. These collaborations are intended to provide us with mutually beneficial opportunities to expand or advance our product pipeline and serve significant unmet medical needs. We have licensed our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that may not be appropriate for our independent product development.
Product Development
 The table below summarizes our active development programs.
 
 
Product/Concept | Intended Use | Development Status1

VCL-HB01therapeutic vaccine for HSV-2 | Prevent and protect against lesion recurrence | Phase 2 
VL-2397 antifungal | Treatment of invasive fungal infections | Phase 2 
Chronic hepatitis B | Eradication of persistent HBV infection | Preclinical 


1 | “Preclinical” (or “nonclinical”) indicates that a specific product candidate is undergoing in vitro testing and/or in vivo testing in animals. “Phase 1” clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. “Phase 2” clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the product candidate. “Phase 3” clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

HSV–2 Program
 In June 2016, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 trial of our HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine, VCL-HB01, to treat patients with symptomatic genital herpes infection. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age who are randomized 2:1 to receive either vaccine or placebo. Recruitment of 261 subjects at 15 U.S. clinical sites was completed in April 2017 and dosing was completed in July 2017. Following the 4th vaccination, each subject entered a 12-month surveillance period during which each new lesion recurrence is assessed in the clinic by the investigator. After the last subject has completed a minimum of 9-months of surveillance, the primary endpoint of annualized recurrence rate will be calculated based on recurrences that are both clinically - and virologically - confirmed. This endpoint provides important information on the number of recurrences over time in this chronic disease setting and is clinically meaningful for both patients and treating physicians. We expect to deliver top-line results during the second quarter of 2018.
 In June 2015, we announced top-line results from our Phase 1/2 trial of our VCL-HB01. A total of 165 HSV-2-seropositive patients were enrolled in the trial. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated safety, 
 5

tolerability and efficacy in otherwise healthy patients aged 18 to 50 years who had experienced two to nine genital herpes recurrences within the prior year. This trial tested the effectiveness of two HSV-2 vaccines, a monovalent vaccine and VCL-HB01, a bivalent vaccine, by comparing the viral shedding rate prevaccination (baseline) to the viral shedding rate postvaccination of each subject. In addition to this primary efficacy endpoint, this trial also evaluated several secondary outcome measures, including genital lesion rate change from baseline, the HSV viral load (or copy numbers) change from baseline, as well as the immunological responses over time from baseline. 
Neither the monovalent nor VCL-HB01 met the primary endpoint (reduction of viral shedding from baseline).  However, VCL-HB01-vaccinated patients achieved statistically significant reductions in the clinically meaningful secondary endpoint of genital lesion rate at 3 months after their final dose. All patients were also followed for safety for 12 months after their final vaccine dose. In addition, we collected clinical efficacy data including lesion rate at 9 months after their final dose.  VCL-HB01 continued to achieve statistically significant reductions in the genital lesion rate when compared to the pre-vaccination period at the nine-month time point after the patients’ final dose. Neither the placebo nor the monovalent vaccine groups achieved statistical significance on this endpoint at nine months after vaccination. 
 About HSV-2
 HSV-2 is a member of the herpes virus family and is the leading cause of recurrent genital herpes worldwide. About 400 million people aged 15-49 years are living with HSV-2 worldwide, and about 20 million are newly infected every year.  About one in six adults 14 to 49 years of age in the United States are infected with HSV-2. Even higher infection rates are evident in developing countries, with further complications in people also infected with HIV. HSV-2 infections are permanent and result in periodic virus shedding. There is no approved vaccine for HSV-2. Although antiviral regimens have become a standard of care in developed countries, we believe their inconvenience and cumulative cost underscore the need for safe, new approaches to reducing HSV-2 lesions, shedding, and transmission.
Antifungal Program
 In February 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of our novel antifungal VL-2397, for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis. The multicenter, open label randomized clinical study, will compare the efficacy and safety of VL-2397 to standard treatment for invasive aspergillosis in acute leukemia patients and recipients of allogeneic HCT. The global Phase 2 trial will enroll approximately 200 patients and will be randomized on a 2:1 basis with approximately 134 patients treated with VL-2397 and 66 patients treated with a standard treatment course of their physician's choice of voriconazole, isavuconazole, or liposomal amphotericin B. The patients in the VL-2397 arm will receive daily treatment with VL-2397 for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week course of physician’s choice of the comparator. The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality will be measured at 4 weeks and again at 6 weeks for the key secondary endpoint. The trial will be conducted at selected sites in North America, Europe and Asia. The U.S. FDA has advised that VL 2397 would be eligible for a Limited Use Indication (LUI) approval assuming a successful outcome of a single Phase 2 trial carried out in accordance with a protocol and statistical analysis plan consistent with the Agency's advice. The final determination whether the drug is approvable will be made by FDA after review of all relevant data. The LUI is a provision of the Limited Population Pathway established under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. In the case of VL-2397, the LUI approval would be for patients for whom alternative regimens are not available to treat their invasive aspergillosis.  A Phase 3 trial would be required to support full approval of VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in a broader population. The FDA has granted Vical Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for VL-2397 in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
 VL-2397 represents a potential new class of antifungal compound to address invasive aspergillus infections, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients. In preclinical studies to date, it has demonstrated faster fungicidal activity than marketed drugs and activity against azole-resistant fungal pathogens. Current treatment options have limited efficacy, as approximately 50-60% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis infections die within 12 weeks. Over the past 30 years, only one new class of antifungal drugs (echinocandins) has been introduced.
 About Invasive Aspergillosis
 Invasive aspergillosis is a life-threatening infection that typically affects immunocompromised patients, including those with acute leukemia and recipients of allogeneic HCT or lung transplants. Infection typically starts in the lungs and rapidly disseminates to other tissues. An estimated 200,000 cases of invasive aspergillosis are diagnosed annually worldwide.

Other Infectious Disease Programs
Ebola
 In January 2015, we and AnGes announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize an equine polyclonal antibody therapy for patients afflicted with Ebola virus disease. We developed and provided to AnGes a DNA vaccine encoding the glycoprotein antigen of the 2014 Zaire strain of Ebola virus, formulated with our proprietary Vaxfectin® adjuvant. AnGes received the right to exclusively develop and commercialize the equine polyclonal antibody therapy in Japan and will be responsible for all development costs. We received an upfront payment and are eligible to receive royalties on net sales and a percentage of payments received by AnGes under any sub-licensing agreements.  Characterization studies of the equine polyclonal antibodies are ongoing.
Adjuvant Development
 DNA Vaccines with Vaxfectin®
 Vaxfectin® is our proprietary, cationic lipid formulation optimized to increase the immune response to vaccines. Vaxfectin® formulations have demonstrated safety and adjuvant activity in DNA vaccine applications in multiple animal models, including nonhuman primates. Studies of Vaxfectin®-formulated DNA vaccines against CMV and measles have shown enhanced immunogenicity in rodents and nonhuman primates. Vaxfectin®-formulated DNA vaccines have also been tested in approximately 400 healthy human subjects receiving influenza, dengue, or HSV-2 vaccines, and collectively, these Phase 1 trials indicate favorable safety profiles of these vaccines. We believe Vaxfectin® is an important potentiator of both antibody and T-cell mediated immune responses to DNA vaccines.
 Other Vaxfectin® Applications
 In 2013, we entered into a nonexclusive license with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, for our patented platform DNA immunization technology and our Vaxfectin® adjuvant for use in the production of antibodies. Under the agreement, BMS is using our technology to generate antibodies with potential therapeutic uses in humans. We also agreed to provide specified quantities of our Vaxfectin® adjuvant to BMS from time to time.
 Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
 We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees, and others. In addition to the agreements summarized below, we conduct ongoing discussions with potential collaborators, licensors and licensees.
In-licensing
 Astellas. In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas, granting us exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize our novel antifungal candidate, VL-2397.  As consideration for the rights under the license, we issued 86,121 shares of our common stock to Astellas and made an up-front payment of $250,000 in cash. The license agreement provides for potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $99.0 million, as well as tiered single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products.  The royalty payments are subject to reduction on a country-by-country basis in certain circumstances where there is not exclusivity in the country. We are responsible for the worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products, at our cost, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities. 
 The license agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of our royalty obligations with respect to licensed products. Either party may terminate the license agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other party’s insolvency.  Astellas may terminate the license agreement earlier if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees oppose or challenge any of the licensed patents. We may terminate the license agreement on a country-by-country basis for reasonable scientific, regulatory, commercial, financial, ethical or other reasons.
 CytRx. In 2001, we entered into an exclusive agreement with CytRx Corporation, or CytRx, which grants us rights to use or sublicense CytRx’s poloxamer technology to enhance viral or non-viral delivery of polynucleotides in all nonexcluded preventive and therapeutic human and animal health applications, including CMV. In addition, the agreement permits our use of CytRx’s technology to enhance the delivery of proteins in prime-boost vaccine applications that involve 
 7

the use of polynucleotides. As part of the agreement, we made a $3.8 million up-front payment and agreed to make potential future milestone and royalty payments. As of December 31, 2017, we had paid CytRx $5.5 million under the agreement.
 The agreement with CytRx expires upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, unless earlier terminated as set forth in the agreement. Each party may terminate the agreement early upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or the material breach of the agreement by, the other party, upon prior written notice to the other party. Subject to certain conditions, we may terminate the agreement early upon prior written notice to CytRx.
 As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate potential milestone payments that we could be obligated to pay under our active in-license agreements total approximately $99.0 million. These amounts assume that all remaining milestones associated with the milestone payments are met. Although we believe that some of the milestones contained in the in-license agreements may be achieved, it is highly unlikely that a significant number of them will be achieved. Because the milestones are highly contingent and we have limited control over whether the regulatory milestones will be achieved, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate how much, if any, of the potential milestone payments will ultimately be paid, or when. Additionally, under these in-license agreements, many of the milestone events are related to progress in clinical trials which will take several years to achieve.
 Under these in-license agreements, we may also be obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of any products which incorporate the in-licensed technology. These royalties are based on percentages of net sales in the single digit range. Our obligations to pay any royalty payments under our in-license agreements are contingent upon the successful development and commercialization of products incorporating the in-licensed technology. Before any products incorporating the in-licensed technology may be sold, such products must be approved by U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities, which will require a substantial amount of additional research and development. Even if such product candidates are advanced through clinical trials, the results of such trials may not support approval by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies. Consequently, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate when or to what extent we will be obligated to pay any royalties under our in-license agreements.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions, and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We believe we have a comprehensive patent portfolio in the United States and in key foreign markets. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 Our patents and patent applications cover, for example, specific DNA constructs and formulations of gene-based product candidates, methods for producing pharmaceutical-grade DNA, and several families of lipid molecules and their uses in DNA delivery, as described more fully below:
  
• | Core DNA Delivery Technology. We either co-owned or had rights to issued U.S. patents covering our core DNA delivery technology, including patents on methods of administering DNA sequences for the purposes of expressing therapeutic proteins or for inducing immune responses and the administration of DNA sequences into blood vessels and the heart. These patents are now expired, but we maintain patents covering specific product applications as described below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lipid Technologies. We are the sole assignee of issued U.S. patents covering numerous examples of cationic lipid compounds that are used to facilitate delivery of plasmids to some tissues. Our HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine candidate and our Vaxfectin® adjuvant are protected in-part by lipid technology and/or lipid compound patents that extend up to March 24, 2020. Patent protection of these key lipids also has been obtained in Europe, Canada and Japan. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a U.S. patent term extension for up to 5 years may be available under certain conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specific DNA Products. Protection for our therapeutic vaccine candidate for HSV-2 includes issued patents in the U.S. and Japan and other foreign counterparts pending in Australia, Canada, and Europe, all of which will expire on July 20, 2027. These patents are co-owned with the University of Washington. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a U.S. patent term extension for up to 5 years may be available under certain conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antifungal Technology. We have been granted the exclusive right to Astellas patents which claim the composition of matter of, and methods of making or using, VL-2397. All of these issued U.S. patents and foreign counterparts will expire on March 13, 2029.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2017, we were the assignee or co-assignee of 46 issued U.S. and foreign patents. We maintain our issued patents by paying maintenance fees to the patent office in each country when due. Where appropriate, we participate in legal proceedings to vigorously defend against the revocation or withdrawal of our patents. The scope and nature of these proceedings generally differ depending on the country in which they are initiated.
 As of December 31, 2017, we were also prosecuting one pending patent application in the United States and one in Canada that cover various aspects of our proprietary technologies, not including patent applications for which we are a co-assignee and that are being prosecuted by our partners.
 See “Risk Factors—Our patents and proprietary rights may not provide us with any benefit and the patents of others may prevent us from commercializing our products,” and “The legal proceedings to obtain and defend patents, and litigation of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, could require us to spend money and could impair our operations.”
 Commercialization and Manufacturing
 We intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through collaborators. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, including infectious diseases. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances.
 We believe our plasmids can be produced in commercial quantities through uniform methods of fermentation and processing that are applicable to all plasmids. In addition, our formulations consist of components that are synthesized chemically using traditional, readily scalable organic synthesis procedures.
 Competition
 We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in infectious disease vaccine research and development. These include Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline plc, MedImmune, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, Merck and Pfizer Inc., among others. We may also experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technologies from companies, universities and other research institutions. These companies may develop proprietary technologies which may materially and adversely affect our business.
 In addition, a number of companies are developing products to address the same diseases that we are targeting. For example, Sanofi, Genocea Biosciences, Inc. and others have products or development programs for HSV-2 treatment. Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, F2G Ltd, Cidera, Inc., and Scynexis, Inc. and others have products or development programs for treatment of invasive fungal infections. If these or any other companies develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our products, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed.
 Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours.
 Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies may expand current requirements for public disclosure of DNA-based product development data, which may harm our competitive position with foreign and U.S. companies developing DNA-based products for similar indications.

Government Regulation
 FDA Review and Approval
 Any products we develop will require regulatory clearances prior to conducting clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. New gene-based products for vaccine or therapeutic applications are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. The precise regulatory requirements with which we will have to comply are uncertain at this time due to the novelty of the gene-based products and indications, or uses, that are currently under development. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, biopharmaceutical testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices.
 Obtaining FDA approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that preclinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. The results of these studies are submitted as a part of an IND which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations.
 A company must submit an IND for each proposed product and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to patients.
 To obtain FDA approval prior to marketing a biopharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans, and are conducted following preclinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its regulatory counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries.
 Clinical trials for therapeutic products are normally done in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals.
 After completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. If the product is classified as a new drug, a New Drug Application, or NDA is required. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development activities, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information.
 Applications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further preclinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 Before marketing clearance for a product can be secured, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. In addition, after marketing clearance is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors, and, if the facility is located in California, by inspectors from the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services.

In addition to the FDA requirements, the NIH has established guidelines for research involving human genetic materials, including recombinant DNA molecules. The FDA cooperates in the enforcement of these guidelines, which apply to all recombinant DNA research that is conducted at facilities supported by the NIH, including proposals to conduct clinical research involving gene therapies. The NIH review of clinical trial proposals and safety information is a public process and often involves review and approval by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH.
 Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register, and report results for, all controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase 1 investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of confidential commercial development data resulting in the loss of competitive secrets, which could be commercially detrimental.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug or biological product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 We received QIDP, Orphan Drug, and Fast Track designation for VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. With Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation, if VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis is approved by FDA, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded. FDA’s Fast Track Drug Development Program is a process designed to facilitate the development and expeditious review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This designation allows for companies to interact with the FDA review team frequently to discuss critical development issues such as study design, required safety data necessary to support approval, and structure and content of an application. Additionally, should the FDA determine that a Fast Track product may be effective after their preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by a sponsor, the FDA may also consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, known as a “rolling” submission.
 Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors. Such laws potentially applicable to our operations include:

• | The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti‑Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.

• | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which may be enforced through whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from

knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, require certain types of individuals and entities to protect the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of certain patient data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative or civil penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity obligations, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Reimbursement and Health Reform
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 In the United States, third‑party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. 
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product.

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, ACA was signed into law that included a number of provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the ACA.
 In addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Further, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.
