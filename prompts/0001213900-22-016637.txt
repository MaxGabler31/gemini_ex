Business Overview



Created by John Hendricks, founder of the Discovery Channel and former Chairman of Discovery Communications, we are a media and entertainment company that offers premium video programming across the principal categories of factual entertainment, including science, history, society, nature, lifestyle and technology. Our mission is to provide premium factual entertainment that informs, enchants and inspires. We are seeking to meet demand for high-quality factual entertainment via SVoD platforms, as well as via bundled content licenses for SVoD and linear offerings, partner bulk sales, brand partnerships and content sales. We are well-positioned for growth as a digital-native video platform monetizing content across this broad revenue stack.

Through the rapid expansion of our library of high-quality titles and by exploiting multiple channels to monetize our programming, we believe that we have achieved global leadership in factual content streaming and are well positioned to capitalize on favorable ongoing industry trends to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.



Curiosity Stream’s award-winning video content library features thousands of nonfiction episodes, including more than 1,000 original, commissioned or co-produced documentaries, of short-form, mid-form and long-form duration. Our films are produced, co-produced or commissioned by us, or licensed through one of our content partnerships, such as with NHK in Japan, ZED in France and Terra Mater in Austria. Our programs are hosted by and feature scientists, experts and celebrities, such as Stephen Hawking, Sir David Attenborough, Sigourney Weaver and Patrick Aryee. Our programs have received four Emmy nominations, including an Emmy Award win for Stephen Hawking’s Favorite Places. Every title on our platform is available on-demand and, other than historical footage or classic documentaries, in high definition or 4K quality.



Through our acquisition in 2021 of One Day University, we also acquired more than 500 lectures from some of the most popular and acclaimed college and university professors in the United States, on topics ranging from American history to Broadway shows. In addition, through our acquisition of Learn25, we acquired approximately 5,000 episodes of audio content and about 1,250 video episodes, packaged as courses on factual topics ranging from religion to biographies to psychology. These acquisitions enable us to expand our offering of factual content into audio and educational courses, as well as package our products in special bundles for consumers and business customers.



In 2021, the Company entered into an enhanced strategic partnership with and investment into Nebula, an SVOD streaming service owned by Standard Broadcast LLC and its affiliated YouTube creators.  Nebula has more than 450,000 paying subscribers and over 140 creators with a combined more than 120 million YouTube subscribers.



Also in 2021, the Company partnered with SPIEGEL TV to accelerate international expansion of Curiosity Stream services, taking a one-third stake in the German joint venture owned by a German media company Spiegel and a German documentary producer Autentic.  The joint venture includes distribution of linear cable channel Curiosity Channel and a localized CuriosityStream SVOD service in German-speaking Europe.



Our Curiosity Stream video content, approximately one-third of which is originally produced with the remaining two-thirds consisting of licensed programming, is available directly through our O&O Service and App Services. Our App Services enable access to CuriosityStream on almost every major consumer device, including streaming media players like Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, all major smart TV brands (e.g., LG, Vizio, Samsung, Sony) and gaming consoles like Xbox. Our service is available in more than 175 countries to any household with a broadband connection for $2.99 per month or $19.99 per year. We also provide a premium service for $9.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Over 85% of subscribers select annual subscription plans, which has reduced subscriber churn and facilitates our ability to learn and serve consumer preferences.



In addition, we have affiliate agreement relationships with, and our service is available directly from, MVPDs that include Comcast and Cox, and vMVPDs and digital distributors that include Amazon Prime Video Channels, Roku Channels, Sling TV and YouTube TV, which we refer to as our “Partner Direct Service” or “Partner Direct Business.” The MVPD, vMVPD and digital distributor partners making up our Partner Direct Business pay us a license fee for sales to individuals who subscribe to CuriosityStream via the partners’ respective platforms.



The technology associated with our Partner Direct Business is designed to facilitate a consistent user experience across the different interface platforms and operating system applications. We provide value for both our users and ourselves through our analytics algorithm and data collection system. Leveraging our database of anonymized user preferences, ratings and behavior, we are constantly refining our content recommendation engine to suggest and serve content to our customers.



In addition to our Partner Direct Services and Businesses, we have affiliate relationships with our Bundled MVPD Partners — MVPDs, broadband and wireless companies in the US and international territories to whom we can offer a broad scope of rights, including 24/7 “linear” channels, our on-demand content library, mobile rights and pricing and packaging flexibility, in exchange for an annual fixed fee or fee per subscriber as part of a multi-year agreement. This Bundled MVPD Business offers us the advantages of long-cycle and recurring revenue and the potential to access hundreds of millions of paying subscribers globally. As a young and digital-native company, we are not laden with some of the overhead costs nor over-dependent on lines of business that may hamper the growth of legacy media companies. We are consequently able to offer Bundled MVPD Partners more attractive rates than well-known conglomerates, meeting the Bundled MVPD Partners’ need to cut costs in their business without losing quantity or quality of factual content.

Our Sponsorship & Advertising Business consists of developing integrated digital brand partnerships designed to offer the chance to be associated with CuriosityStream content in a variety of forms, including short and long form program integration, branded social media promotional videos, broadcast advertising spots, and digital display ads.



Our Program Sales Business is focused on providing factual content to entertainment media companies. We have the opportunity to provide a turnkey, financially attractive “factual solution” to meet this business demand. We are able to sell to certain media companies a collection of our existing titles in a traditional program sales deal. We are also able to sell selected rights (such as in territories or on platforms that are lower priority for us) to content we create before we even begin production. This latter model reduces risk in our content development decisions and creates program sales revenue.



Our Corporate & Association Partnership business has been comprised primarily of selling subscriptions in bulk to companies and organizations that in turn offer these subscriptions to their employees and members as an employment benefit or “gift of curiosity.”



Our business model relies on the collaboration of (1) our content team, which works with more than 150 production companies and distributors across the world to create and acquire programming, (2) our legal and finance teams, which structure and formalize agreements, (3) our creative services and content operations teams, which develop all of the marketing materials, metadata and other assets associated with a piece of content, and (4) our content operations and technology teams, which then deliver our content and services to all manner of devices and streaming platforms for our Direct, Partner Direct, Bundled MVPD and other businesses.



Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $71.3 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $37.6 million.



Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our product and service lines and channels through which we generate revenue.



Competition



We compete for the time and attention of our users across different forms of media, including traditional broadcast, cable, satellite and internet-delivered video, other providers of SVoD services (e.g., Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix), other providers of in-home and mobile entertainment such as radio, music streaming services, and social media and networking websites. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another.



We compete to attract, engage, and retain users with other content providers based on several factors, including: the user experience, content range and quality, ease of use of our platform, price, accessibility, perceptions of advertising load, brand awareness and reputation.



Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, legacy operating histories and larger marketing and content budgets, as well as greater financial, technical, human and other resources. However, we currently face limited competition in the factual SVoD category.



Seasonality



Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.
Intellectual Property



Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and proprietary rights arrangements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and we control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.



Our registered trademarks in the United States include “Curiosity,” “CuriosityStream” and “One Day University.”



We are the registrant of the internet domain name for our website, www.curiositystream.com, as well as others. We own rights to proprietary processes and trade secrets, including those underlying the CuriosityStream service.

Government Regulation



As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to several foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to information and network security, data protection, privacy, and governmental access to data, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted, updated, or new laws passed in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information and network security and data protection, the laws in the United States, the European Union (the “EU”), and other jurisdictions globally can require specified actions to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of networks and data. Additionally, laws in many U.S. states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of personally identifiable information. Likewise, U.S. states, the EU, China, and other jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users, regulators, and sometimes law enforcement if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of information, including personal information and personally identifiable information.



We may also be subject to U.S. federal and state, EU and other foreign laws regarding privacy, the collection of data of minors, and the privacy of customer data. Our privacy policy and terms of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of customer information and are posted on our website. Any failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy-related laws, obligations, or regulations globally could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities, individuals, or others. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy or security of our customers’ information could result in a loss of confidence in our service among existing and potential customers, and ultimately, in a loss of customers and advertisers.



Privacy Policy



We collect and use certain types of information from our customers in accordance with the privacy policy that is posted on our website. We collect personally identifiable information directly from customers when they register to use our service and sign up to receive email newsletters. We may also obtain information about our customers from other customers and third parties. Our policy is to use the collected information to customize and personalize advertising and content for customers and to enhance the customer experience when using our service.



We also use automated data collection technology, such as tracking cookies, to collect non-personally identifiable information to help us track customer interactions with our service. Third-party advertisers and service partners may also use tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding use of our platforms.



We have implemented commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to our customers’ personally identifiable information.



Employees and Human Capital 



In 2021 and 2020, we had approximately 83 and 54 total, full-time employees on average, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 92 full-time employees, all of whom were located in the U.S. We have one location, a corporate office plus filming studio and edit suites, in Silver Spring, Maryland (the “Office”). Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. Our ability to attract, retain and improve the effectiveness of our employees is a critical factor for executing our growth strategy. We strive to recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences.

We are committed to diversity and inclusion as well as equitable pay within our workforce. To further some of these initiatives, following our Business Combination, we retained Willis Towers Watson, a leading global advisory firm, to review our compensation structure. Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees and executives and is comprised of a mix of competitive base salary, bonus and equity compensation awards, as well as other employee benefits. Almost all current employees have received equity grants with vesting conditions designed to facilitate the retention of personnel and the opportunity to benefit financially from the Company’s growth and profitability. Our 401(k) Retirement Plan includes a Company match of up 100 percent of contributions up to 3 percent of the employee’s compensation and a 50 percent Company match of contributions between 3 percent and 5 percent of the employee’s compensation. In 2022, we expect to engage a recruiting firm, or adopt a recruiting tool, that specializes in diversity candidates to assist us in our endeavor to attract and employ diverse applicants to open positions. In addition, as part of a broader initiative to establish and maintain a culture and set of shared values, we intend to survey our employees as to diversity-related topics, including requesting that they supply demographic information about themselves and their interest in participating in diversity and inclusion programs.



Our human resource strategy is overseen by our Chief Operating Officer and executive team, which aims to provide regular updates to our Board. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.



In addition, the health and safety of our employees and communities are of primary concern to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to protect our workforce, including:




● | Mandating or allowing remote or hybrid work for all employees; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing additional cleaning and sanitization practices on top of the robust sanitization protocols already undertaken in the Office;
