ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company”, “View Systems”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to View Systems, Inc.
 
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
View Systems was incorporated in Florida on January 25, 1989, as Beneficial Investment Group, Inc. and became active in September 1998 when we began development of our digital video product line and changed the company’s name to View Systems, Inc. Starting in 1999 we expanded our business operations through a series of acquisitions of technologies we use in our digital video recorder technology products and in our concealed weapons technology.
 
On July 25, 2003, View Systems incorporated View Systems, Inc. as a wholly owned Nevada corporation for the sole purpose of changing the domicile of the company from Florida to Nevada. On July 31, 2003, articles of merger were filed with the states of Florida and Nevada to complete the domicile change. In 2009 we domiciled to Colorado.
 
OUR BUSINESS
 
View Systems, Inc. develops, produces and markets computer software and hardware systems for security and surveillance applications. In 1998 digital video recorder technology was our first developed product and we enhanced this product line by developing interfaces with other various technologies, such as facial recognition, access control cards and control devices such as magnetic locks, alarms and other common security devices.
 
We expanded our product line in 2002 to include a concealed weapons detection system we call ViewScan. We have penetrated four major market segments for this product: correctional facilities, judicial facilities, probation offices and federal facilities in the Mid-Atlantic States, the West Coast and the South. In 2003 we added a hazardous material first response wireless video transmitting system to our product line we refer to as Visual First Responder. The markets for these units are first responder units for agencies such as the National Guard, Coast Guard, Army, state law enforcement agencies, and fire departments. Both of these technologies were licensed initially from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (“INEL”). Until 2005 we assembled all of our products in-house.
 
By redesigning and enhancing the ViewScan, we offset the impact of the of our current license agreements. We in the last several years we developed a superior product to patent and continue to capitalize on the competitive advantage we had in the markets we had entered.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
We currently have the concealed weapons detection system product. We no longer manufacture the “first responder” system for competition reasons. Our current principal products and services include:
ViewScan Concealed Weapons Detection System
 
ViewScan, which is also sold under the name “Secure Scan”, is a walk-through concealed weapons detector, which uses data sensing technology to accurately pinpoint the location, size and number of concealed weapons. Today we no longer sell these units except for special orders paid in advance for an average retail price of approximately $9,500 with a one year extended warranty. We have licensed the manufacturing and selling of the initial ViewScan to a company called IP Video that has built 25 units and is selling them and paying a $300 Royalty payment per unit sold.
Medical Services Including Men’s Health and Physiological Quality of Life
 
The Company sold its Medical Services division; which is comprised of Men’s Health clinic interests, to Ultimate Sports, Inc. in exchange for 122,500 shares of Ultimate Sports, Inc. and Ultimate Sports, Inc.
OUR REMAINING MARKET
 
A primary market for our ViewScan portal has been federal and state government courthouses, county and municipal buildings, and correctional facilities. We have installed our ViewScan weapons detection products in a variety of courthouse, federal government and correctional facility situations including the Security and Exchange Commission.
MANUFACTURING
 
We no longer manufacture the current View Scan product. We have devised an enhanced version which we are in process of filing for a patent and calling the ViewScan II.
 
We are in process of changing our provisional patent into a permanent patent. We are capable of building a wide archway to facilitate current commercial class (42 inches opening) doors.
 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Even though we get the occasional new order, we no longer solicit sales of the current View Scans but instead capitalize on the demand for parts and service. Until we a have our new and improved model in production we will service, fix and repair field operating units.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS
 
New Jersey and California
 
COMPETITION
 
The markets for our products are extremely competitive. Competitors include a broad range of companies that develop and market products for the identification and video surveillance markets. In the weapons detection market, we compete with Ranger Security Scanners, Inc. and Garrett Electronics, Inc. in the United States, and an Italian company, CEIA SpA, which has the most sophisticated electromagnetic induction product. CIEA apparently believes we have good ideas as they have copied various methods and enhancements from our products.
TRADEMARK, LICENSES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Certain features of our products and documentation are proprietary, and we rely on a combination of patent, contract, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary information. We limit access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation and other proprietary information. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and mutual non-disclosure agreements with our manufacturing representatives, dealers and systems integrators. Notwithstanding such actions, a court considering these provisions may determine not to enforce such provisions or only partially enforce such provisions.
 
The ViewScan concealed weapons detection technology involves sensing technology and data acquisition/analysis software subsystems that have patents pending or issued to the U.S. Department of Energy. We have not renewed our license, with the INEL to commercialize, manufacture and market the concealed weapons detection technology. View Systems has not filed for patents and has found that the expense and difficulty of patenting this product would be financially prohibitive.
 
Governmental ownership of the patents is advantageous to us; however, the costs have outweighed the benefits. We have not received improvements, the promised funding or active support from our government licensors. We have, however, paid money and spent time to advance the technologies.
 
Because the software and firmware (software imbedded in hardware) are in a state of continuous development, we have not filed applications to register the copyrights for these items. However, under law, copyright vests upon creation of our software and firmware. Registration is not a prerequisite for the acquisition of copyright rights. We take steps to insure that notices are placed on these items to indicate that they are copyright protected. The copyright protection for our software extends for the 20-year statutory period from the date of first “publication,” distribution of copies to the general public, or from the date of creation, whichever occurs first.
 
We have also obtained licenses for certain software from third parties for incorporation into our products.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We outsource improvements or changes when requested by customers and warranted financially.
 
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
We are not subject to government approval or regulation in the manufacture of our products or the components in our products. However, our products are subject to certain government restrictions on sales to “unfriendly” countries and countries designated as adversarial, which may limit our sales to the international market. In addition, our resellers and end users may be subject to numerous regulations that stem from surveillance activities. We also benefit from the recent “made in America” trade laws where non-United States manufactures must secure waivers in order to sell security and surveillance products to United States domestic end-users.
 
Cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws
 
The Company has not determined any recognizable cost related to compliance with environmental laws.
