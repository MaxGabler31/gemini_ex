Item 1. Business
When we use the terms “Civitas,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” we are referring to Civitas Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. We have included certain technical terms important to an understanding of our business under Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Term above. Throughout this document, we make statements that may be classified as “forward-looking.” Please refer to the Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section above for an explanation of these types of statements.
Overview
Civitas is an independent Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the acquisition, development, and production of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the “DJ Basin”) of Colorado. At year-end, we had approximately 481,500 net acres of large, contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of the DJ Basin. We believe our acreage in the DJ Basin has been significantly delineated by our own drilling success and by the success of offset operators, providing confidence that our inventory is repeatable and will continue to generate economic returns.
As of December 31, 2021, we operated a total of 2,838 gross producing wells, of which 2,330 were horizontal. Our working and net revenue interest for all operated wells averaged approximately 78% and 64%, respectively. The Wattenberg Field has a low cost structure, mature infrastructure, strong production efficiencies, multiple producing horizons, multiple service providers, established reserves, and prospective drilling opportunities, which helps facilitate predictable production and reserve growth. In 2022, we expect to run an average of 3.5 operated rigs and 3 operated crews that will drill 190 to 210 and complete 165 to 175 gross operated wells. We continually monitor the commodity price and regulatory environment and retain the operational and financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to such conditions.
We consider our liquidity, low leverage, and minimal volume commitments to be a core strength and strategic advantage that we are focused on maintaining. Civitas is committed to maintaining low leverage and high financial flexibility. Additionally, our strong liquidity position of over $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 is expected to deliver further financial flexibility to execute on our long-term strategy. 
Civitas is focused on exceptional performance in managing Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) issues, with a goal of mitigating risks while benefiting our stakeholders and the communities where we operate. Utilizing an aggressive operational emissions-reduction program coupled with multi-year investment in certified emissions credits to offset residual emissions, we believe Civitas is Colorado’s first carbon neutral operator on both a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis, meaning that Civitas is at net-zero balance between emitting and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. Any carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of Civitas operations has been balanced by an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide being removed. This is achieved via both internal reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and through the purchase of carbon offsets and renewable energy credits. Additional planned projects include electric vehicle fleet conversion, community solar development, and installation of electric vehicle charging stations, as well as an ongoing responsibly sourced gas partnership with Xcel Energy, and partnerships with the Payne Institute, which we believe will solidify Civitas as a responsible steward of the energy transition. Civitas' Board of Directors also has a dedicated ESG Committee that is responsible for overseeing and supporting the Company’s commitment to environmental, health, and safety, social responsibility, sustainability, and other public policy matters relevant to the Company. The ESG Committee assists senior management in setting the Company’s general strategy relating to ESG matters and in developing, implementing, and monitoring initiatives and policies based on that strategy. 
Our Business Strategies
The Company’s primary objective is to maximize shareholder returns by responsibly developing our oil and natural gas resources. Key aspects of our strategy include:
•Multi-well pad development across our leasehold. We believe horizontal development is the most efficient, environmentally responsible, and safest way to recover the hydrocarbons located within our leasehold. We continuously evaluate completion designs to increase well productivity and apply a multivariate regression analysis with the objective of optimizing economic returns. Petrophysical, geological, and geophysical analysis is used in conjunction with spacing evaluations and individualized well designs to increase value of each spacing unit.
•Continuous safety improvement and strict adherence to health and safety regulations.  Our goal is to utilize industry best practices to meet or exceed regulatory requirements and consistently engage stakeholders in our development planning and operations. We strive to maintain a safe workplace for our employees and contractors at all times. 
Specifically, during 2021, we maintained a meaningful safety track record as evidenced by a low total recordable incident rate of 0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Environmental stewardship.  We believe we are the first carbon neutral operator in Colorado on both a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis. We constantly strive to control and reduce emissions and seek to comply with all applicable air quality and other environmental rules and regulations. We employ industry-leading best practices, including electric drilling rigs and pipeline gathering and takeaway as well as vapor recovery and leak detection equipment where feasible and appropriate. Additionally, we work closely with our service providers to help ensure they stay in compliance with environmental regulations when operating on our behalf.
•Disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures and capital allocation.  Opportunities are evaluated primarily in the context of maintaining development flexibility, significant free cash flow, and a strong financial profile. We pursue value-accretive acquisitions and strive to maximize scale while minimizing financial and operational risk.
•Prudent risk management.  The Company believes a healthy balance sheet, focus on cost control, and minimizing long-term commitments are critical to controlling risk. A low debt profile and judicious use of hedging practices help reduce cash flow volatility. We believe we have one of the lowest cost structures in the basin. Continually striving to be a cost-efficient operator and maintaining a flexible capital spending program enable us to respond to changing market conditions. 
Significant Developments in 2021
2021 was a transformational year for Civitas. On April 1, 2021, Civitas completed its acquisition of HighPoint Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“HighPoint”) pursuant to the terms of the related Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “HighPoint Merger”). On November 1, 2021, Civitas completed its merger with Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Extraction”), pursuant to the terms of the related Agreement and Plan of Merger ( the “Extraction Merger”) and its acquisition of CPPIB Crestone Peak Resources America Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Crestone Peak”), pursuant to the terms of the related Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Crestone Peak Merger”). These mergers positioned Civitas as the largest pure-play DJ Basin producer and created a combined business with peer-leading scale that allow us to maximize our unique competitive strengths and maintain low costs. Civitas’ 2022 budget includes LOE and recurring cash G&A costs per Boe that are more than 30% lower than that of the nine months ended September 30, 2021, highlighting the anticipated benefits of consolidation. The Company’s low-cost operating model, combined with its high-quality asset base and fortress balance sheet is expected to allow Civitas to deliver significant value to stakeholders.
Further, in May 2021, the Company announced that the Board of Directors (the “Board”) established an annual fixed cash dividend of $1.40 per share, to be declared and paid on a quarterly basis. Upon the closing of the Extraction and Crestone Peak mergers, the annual fixed cash dividend was increased to $1.85 per share. Finally, in March 2022, the Board approved the initiation of a quarterly variable cash dividend equal to 50% of free cash flow after the fixed cash dividend for the preceding twelve-month period and pro forma for all acquisition and divestiture activity, assuming pro forma compliance with certain leverage targets. The Company’s inaugural quarterly variable cash dividend has been declared at $0.75 per share and will be paid in combination with the fixed cash dividend on March 30, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 18, 2022. The total quarterly dividend of $1.2125 per share equates to a 10% annualized dividend yield based on the share price as of February 28, 2022, which we believe is one of the highest yields in the sector. 
On the operations front, the Company continued its development in the DJ Basin while testing enhanced completion designs on large, efficient multi-well pads throughout the Company’s acreage position. Enhanced completion designs varied to ensure that thorough knowledge could be applied to future development programs. Fluid volumes and types, fluid rates, proppant volumes and types, stage spacing, perforation architecture, lateral spacing, and flowback techniques were the primary variables that were tested throughout the 2021 program. Along with extensive internal evaluation, the Company will also continue to monitor industry trends, public data, and information from non-operated wells to further define optimum completion techniques. We focused our efforts on completing drilled but uncompleted wells during the first nine months of 2021 and deployed an average of three rigs during the fourth quarter of 2021. The aforementioned mergers, along with the Company's drilling and completion activity in 2021, drove an increase to our sales volumes of approximately 364% when comparing the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020.
During 2021, the Company incurred capital costs of $299.4 million that, along with the incremental production acquired through mergers, drove an increase in sales volumes to 56.0 MBoe per day. The capital invested during 2021 allowed the Company to drill 49 gross operated wells, complete 100 gross operated wells, and turn to sales 70 gross operated wells.
The Company's midstream assets provide reliable gathering, treating, and storage for the Company’s operated production while reducing facility site footprints, leading to more cost-efficient operations and reduced emissions and surface disturbance per Boe produced. Additionally, this infrastructure helps ensure that the Company's production is not constrained by any single midstream service provider. 
Rocky Mountain Infrastructure (“RMI”), together with adjacent gathering assets acquired from HighPoint, serves the Company’s eastern acreage position with multiple interconnects to four different natural gas processors. Significant cost and operational synergies have been realized with the combination of RMI and HighPoint midstream assets. Additionally, in 2019, the Company installed a new oil gathering line to Riverside Terminal (on the Grand Mesa Pipeline), which resulted in a corresponding $1.25 to $1.50 per barrel reduction to our oil differentials for barrels transported on such gathering line. The Company completed an additional oil interconnect in September 2021, thus providing additional outlets that provide flow assurance and minimize differentials. The total value of reduced oil differentials during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $5.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively 
As a result of the Crestone Peak Merger, the Company acquired a gas gathering system that serves the Company's southern acreage position and an oil gathering system that serves a portion of the Company's western acreage. The gas gathering system ensures reliable, low-pressure service at the wellhead. The capacity of this system is in the process of being expanded with the addition of another compressor station. The oil gathering system gathers, treats, and stores oil and water from multiple nearby producing pads and subsequently delivers each to downstream outlets. 
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021:
 | Crude Oil | Natural Gas | | Natural Gas Liquids | Total Proved
Estimated Proved Reserves | (MBbls) | (MMcf) | | (MBbls) | (MBoe)

Total Proved | 143,579 | | 888,499 | | 106,028 | 397,690

Total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 increased by approximately 236% over the comparable period in 2020.    
The following table summarizes our PV-10 reserve value, sales volumes, projected capital spend, and proved undeveloped drilling locations as of December 31, 2021:
 | | | | Average Net Daily | | | | Gross Proved

_____________________
(1)Proved reserves and related future net revenue and PV-10 were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $66.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.60 per MMBtu HH. Adjustments were then made for location, grade, transportation, gravity, and Btu content, which resulted in a decrease of $4.96 per Bbl for crude oil and a decrease of $1.24 per MMBtu for natural gas assuming an average Btu factor of 1.1 MMBtu/Mcf.
(2)We believe that PV-10 provides useful and relevant information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies (specifically, the relative monetary significance of our reserves). Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating the Company and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. Please refer to the Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure presented in the “Reserves” subsection of Item 1 below. 
(3)The Company's gross proved undeveloped drilling locations as of December 31, 2021 have an average lateral length of 2 miles.
Our Operations
Our operations are located in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin of Colorado, and target the Niobrara and Codell formations. As of December 31, 2021, our total position consisted of approximately 769,900 gross (536,700 net) acres, and our estimated proved reserves were 397,690 MBoe and contributed 56.0 MBoe per day of sales volumes during 2021. We believe our position allows us to control the pace, costs, and completion techniques used in the development of our reserves.
As of December 31, 2021, we had interests in a total of 3,918 gross producing wells, of which 3,351 were horizontal and 508 were net revenue only interests. Our working and net revenue interest for all wells in which we had a working interest averaged approximately 67% and 54%, respectively. Our sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 116.2 MBoe per day. 
We drilled and participated in drilling 49 gross (43.0 net) wells in 2021 in the Wattenberg Field. As of December 31, 2021, we have an identified drilling inventory of approximately 234 gross (178.0 net) proved undeveloped drilling locations on our acreage. 
Reserves
Estimated Proved Reserves
The summary data with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our reserve estimates do not include probable or possible reserves. Our estimated proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were determined using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms included in the beginning of this report.
Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates for undeveloped properties are more imprecise than reserve estimates for producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all of these estimates are expected to change as new information becomes available. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated. The actual quantities and present values of our estimated proved reserves may vary from what we have estimated. 
The table below sets forth information regarding our estimated proved reserves, nearly all of which is located in the Wattenberg Field in the Rocky Mountain region, as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. The proved reserve estimates were prepared by third-party independent reserve engineers Ryder Scott Company, LP. (“Ryder Scott”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) as of December 31, 2019. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table is not intended to represent the current market value of our proved reserves nor does it give any effect to or reflect our commodity price derivatives or current commodity prices.

(1)Proved reserves were calculated using the preceding twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices, which were $66.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.60 per MMBtu HH, $39.57 per Bbl WTI and $1.99 per MMBtu HH, and $55.85 per Bbl WTI and $2.58 per MMBtu HH for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Adjustments were made for location and grade.
(2)Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil.
Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic productivity at greater distances. 
Proved undeveloped locations in our December 31, 2021 reserve report are included in our development plan and are scheduled to be drilled within five years from the year they were initially recorded. Annually, management creates a capital expenditure plan based on our best available data at the time the plan is developed. The development plan is based upon management’s evaluation of a number of qualitative and quantitative factors including estimated risk-based returns, estimated well density, commodity prices and cost forecasts, recent drilling results and well performance, and anticipated availability of services, equipment, supplies and personnel. Currently, all PUDs in our reserve report are planned to be developed within the next two and one-half years, well within the allotted five-year window. Generally, the Company books proved undeveloped locations within one development spacing area from developed producing locations. For the instances where a proved undeveloped location is beyond one spacing area from a developed producing location, the Company utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology inclusive of, but not limited to, pressure performance, geologic mapping, offset productivity, electric logs, seismic, and production data.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 234 gross proved undeveloped locations compared to 216 gross for the comparable period in 2020. Of the total gross proved undeveloped locations at December 31, 2021, approximately 78% and 22% are scheduled to be drilled at 4 to 8 wells per section and 9 to 16 wells per section, respectively. Wells per section are estimated based on equivalent spacing between wells for a 640-acre section.
Total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2021 increased 279.5 MMBoe, or 236%, to 397.7 MMBoe when compared to December 31, 2020. A summary of the Company's changes in quantities of proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:
 | Net Reserves (MBoe)
Beginning of year | 118,192 
Extensions and discoveries | 36 
Production | (8,595) 
Removed from capital program | (24,054) 
Purchases of minerals in place(1) | 332,093 
Revisions to previous estimates | (19,982) 
End of year | 397,690 

____________________
(1) Includes all changes made to acquired reserves since the closing date of the Extraction and Crestone Peak mergers.
The 24.1 MMBoe of PUD demotions is due to those locations being removed from the five-year drilling program as we high-graded our drilling program and refined our PUD booking philosophy. The 332.1 MMBoe of purchases of minerals in place is comprised of 42.5 MMBoe, 166.8 MMBoe, and 122.8 MMBoe from the HighPoint, Extraction, and Crestone Peak mergers, respectively. The negative revision to previous estimates of 20.0 MMBoe is the result of removing 13.1 MMBoe of reserves due to converting the variable well operating expense cost model to a fixed cost model which shortened economic well lives, removing 6.9 MMBoe due to engineering revisions, removing 7.1 MMBoe for changes in other items including fuel gas, interests, shrink, yield, and differentials, offset by a positive pricing revision of 7.1 MMBoe resulting from an increase in average commodity price from $39.57 per Bbl WTI and $1.99 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $66.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.60 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Reconciliation of Proved Reserves PV-10 to Standardized Measure
PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Neither our PV-10 measure nor the Standardized Measure purports to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):
 | December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
PV-10 | $ | 5,327.2 | | | $ | 437.1 | | $ | 858.1
Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10%(1) | (915.1) | | | — | | | —
Standardized Measure | $ | 4,412.1 | | | $ | 437.1 | | $ | 858.1

____________________________
(1) The tax basis of our oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 provides more tax deduction than income generated from our oil and gas properties when the reserve estimates were prepared using $66.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.60 per MMBtu HH, $39.57 per Bbl WTI and $1.99 per MMBtu HH, and $55.85 per Bbl WTI and $2.58 per MMBtu HH, respectively.

____________________
(1) Includes all changes made to acquired reserves since the closing date of the Extraction and Crestone Peak mergers.
As of December 31, 2021, our proved undeveloped reserves were 79.9 MMBoe, all of which are scheduled to be drilled within five years from the year they were initially recorded. During 2021, the Company converted 24% of its proved undeveloped reserves, which is comprised of 58 gross wells representing net reserves of 14.2 MMBoe, at a cost of $111.2 million. The net decrease of 24.1 MMBoe in PUD demotions is the result of removing 91 PUD locations as they were no longer part of our five-year drilling program. The acquisition of 63.0 MMBoe in net PUD volumes is the result of adding 22.6 MMBoe and 40.4 MMBoe net reserves due to the Extraction and Crestone Peak mergers, respectively. No PUD volumes were added as a result of the HighPoint Merger. Negative revisions of 4.0 MMBoe were due to a combination of reductions related to the revised well operating cost model and adjustments to the accounting of fuel gas, shrink, and yields, partially offset by an increase in commodity pricing of 4.2 MMBoe.

Production, Revenues and Price History
Oil and natural gas prices fluctuated significantly during 2020 and 2021. Oil prices are impacted by production levels, inventory levels, real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather, and global demand. We reevaluate our development plan based on oil and natural gas prices, however, generally speaking, the Company strategy is focused on maintaining production broadly flat, growing primarily through consolidation. 
Sensitivity Analysis 
If oil and natural gas SEC prices declined by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would decrease by 1% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately 16% or $859.7 million. If oil and natural gas SEC prices increased by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would increase by 1% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately 16% or $865.4 million.

Customers
We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations because there are numerous potential customers for our product.
Delivery Commitments
The Company is party to a number of purchase agreements to deliver fixed determinable quantities of crude oil, gas, and NGLs. These agreements include defined volume commitments over terms ending in 2023 and 2029. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is required to make periodic deficiency payments for any shortfalls in delivering minimum gross volume commitments, which are set in six-month to one-year periods. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned a working interest at December 31, 2021.
 | Oil | Natural Gas | | Total | Operated
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net | Gross | Net
Rocky Mountain | 3,374 | | 2,245.7 | | 36 | | 25.5 | | 3,410 | | 2,271.2 | 2,838 | 2,221.6

Acreage
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the developed and undeveloped acreage in which we own a working interest as of December 31, 2021, along with the PV-10 value. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty, and other similar interests is excluded from this summary.
 | Developed Acres(1) | Undeveloped Acres(2) | | Total Acres | PV-10 
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net | (in millions)
DJ Basin | 495,100 | | 387,200 | | 139,700 | | 94,300 | | 634,800 | 481,500 | 
Other Rocky Mountain | 109,800 | | 37,000 | | 25,300 | | 18,200 | | 135,100 | 55,200 | 
Total | 604,900 | | 424,200 | | 165,000 | | 112,500 | | 769,900 | 536,700 | $ | 5,327.2

(1) Developed acreage is acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease.
(2) Undeveloped acreage are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
Many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production. We intend to extend our strategic leases to the extent possible, and decisions to let leasehold expire generally relate to areas outside of our core area of development or when the expirations do not pose material impacts to development plans or reserves. The following table sets forth the undeveloped acreage, as of December 31, 2021, that will expire in the years indicated unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates.

 | Expiring 2022 | Expiring 2023 | | Expiring 2024 | Expiring 2025 and Beyond

Derivative Activity 
In addition to supply and demand, oil, natural gas, and NGL prices are affected by seasonal, economic, local, and geo-political factors that we can neither control nor predict. We attempt to mitigate a portion of our exposure to potentially adverse market changes in commodity prices and the associated impact on cash flows through the use of derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into the following commodity price derivative contracts:

The Company did not enter into any commodity price derivative contracts subsequent to December 31, 2021 through the filing of this report other than those novated from Bison as described in Part II, Item 8, Note 14 - Subsequent Events.
Title to Properties
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, obligations incident to operating and joint venture agreements, liens for current taxes, other industry-related constraints, and certain other leasehold restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties. Although title to our properties is subject to complex interpretation of multiple conveyances, deeds, reservations, and other instruments that serve to affect mineral title, we believe that none of these risks will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or otherwise materially interfere with the operation of our business.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that often have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce, and market oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations, and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and obtaining transportation for the oil and natural gas we produce. There is also competition between producers of oil and natural gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state, and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of certain operations. The effect and potential impacts of these risks are difficult to accurately predict.
Further, oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 63% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 were oil and natural gas liquids reserves, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $85.64 per Bbl to a low of $47.47 per Bbl, and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $23.86 per MMBtu to a low of $2.43 per MMBtu. 
Insurance Matters
As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business, either because such insurance is not available or customary, or because premium costs are considered cost-prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes, and numerous other laws and regulations. The jurisdictions in which we own and operate properties or assets for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including, among other things, provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the production and operation of wells and other facilities, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the proper abandonment of wells and pipelines. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and size of associated facilities, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and the suspension or cessation of operations. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry can increase the cost of doing business and negatively affect profitability. Because such laws and regulations are frequently revised and amended through various legislative actions and rulemakings, it is difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional rulemakings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered at the federal, state, and various local government levels, including statutorily and through powers granted to various agencies that regulate our industry, and various court actions. We cannot predict when or whether any such rulemakings may become effective or if the outcomes will negatively affect our operations.
We believe that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. However, it is difficult to estimate the potential impact on our business from existing regulations adopted by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) in November 2020 pursuant to Colorado Senate Bill 19-181, discussed herein, as well as ongoing rulemaking, which impose a number of new and amended requirements on our operations. These requirements could make it more difficult and costly to develop new oil and natural gas wells and to continue to produce existing wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, and delay or prevent development in certain areas or under certain conditions. The COGCC’s rulemaking efforts are still ongoing, and thus we cannot assure that the existing rules, as implemented, or the pending rulemaking, will not have a material and adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. In addition, the current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur, or past noncompliance with laws or regulations may be discovered, any of which could likewise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
Regulation of production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state, and federal statutes, rules, orders, and regulations. Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require, among other things, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Colorado, the state in which we own and operate the vast majority of our properties, has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the spacing and unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the regulation of well spacing and well density, and procedures for proper plugging and abandonment of wells and associated facilities. These regulations effectively identify well densities by geologic formation and the appropriate spacing and pooling unit size to effectively drain the resources. Operators can apply for exceptions to such regulations, including applications to increase well densities to more effectively recover the oil and gas resources. Moreover, Colorado imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
We own interests in properties located onshore in primarily one U.S. state, Colorado. This state regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, best management practices and/or conditions of approval for operating wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Colorado laws also govern a number of environmental matters, including setbacks from buildings, schools, and other occupied areas, sensitive habitats and/or disproportionately impacted communities, consideration of alternative locations for new wells, the handling and disposal of waste materials, prevention of venting and flaring, mitigation of noise, lighting, visual, odor, and dust impacts, air pollutant emissions permitting, protection of certain wildlife habitat, protection of public health, safety, welfare, and environment, and evaluation of cumulative impacts. 
Regulation of transportation of oil
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from how it affects operations of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
FERC issued a series of orders in 1996 and 1997 to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been greatly reduced and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EP Act of 2005”) is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation more accessible to natural gas services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, (1) to use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases, or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point-of-sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although nondiscriminatory-take regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress.
Our sales of natural gas are also subject to requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in the state in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from how it affects operations of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers, and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of derivatives 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market with the intent to provide greater transparency and reduction of risk between counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements and requires many derivative transactions to be cleared on exchanges. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
Our natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing safety and health, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or natural resources, noncompliance with which can result in substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties and other sanctions, including suspension or cessation of operations. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits and other approvals before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment; require the assessment and mitigation of potential surface impacts; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities that have certain impacts or that occur in certain areas; require some form of investigation or remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former and ongoing legacy operations such as plugging low-producing wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker, public health, and natural resource protection and impose substantial liabilities or curtail operations for unpermitted pollutant emissions or failure to comply with regulatory filing obligations. Cumulatively, these laws and regulations may impact our operations.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or financial position.
Air emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification and operation of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining required air permits can significantly delay the development of certain oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues.
Federal Air Regulation
In May 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) issued additional New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) rules, known as Subpart OOOOa, focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from oil and natural gas operations. Among other things, these revisions imposed new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements for oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. On September 14, 2020, the EPA finalized the Review Rule rescinding certain prior source category determinations for the transmission and storage segments and parts of the 2016 rules regulating methane emissions for the oil and gas industry. Separately, on September 14, 2020, the EPA finalized the Reconsideration Rule that made policy and technical amendments to the NSPS rules that were raised in administrative petitions that include proposed changes to, among other things, the frequency for monitoring fugitive emissions at well sites and compressor stations. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to rescind the Reconsideration Rule by September 2021. Both Rules are subject to ongoing litigation, and therefore, future obligations continue to remain uncertain under the Clean Air Act. On November 2, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) proposed a suite of NSPS program rules, known as Subparts OOOOb and OOOOc that, if adopted, will have a further impact on the upstream and midstream oil and gas sectors. As proposed, Subparts OOOOb and OOOOc will impact new, modified, existing and/or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector. The proposed regulations include additional inspections, emission control requirements, and additional financial assurance for plugged and abandoned wells. The proposed rules for new and modified facilities are estimated to be finalized by the end of 2022, while any standards finalized for existing facilities will require further state rulemaking actions over the next several years before they become applicable and effective.
In October 2015, the EPA finalized its rule lowering the earlier 75 part per billion (“ppb”) national ambient air quality standards (“2008 NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA to 70 ppb (“2015 NAAQS”). The state of Colorado’s Denver Metro and North Front Range (“DM/NFR”) air quality control region has been unable to attain the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS since their adoption, and received a bump-up in its existing non-attainment status for the 2008 NAAQS from “moderate” to “serious” in 2019. Oil and natural gas operations in “serious” ozone non-attainment areas, including in the DM/NFR area, are subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements for new and modified facilities, and increased permitting delays and costs. Additionally, The DM/NFR’s non-attainment boundary for the 2015 NAAQS was successfully challenged by environmental groups and local governments seeking to expand the boundary to include all of northern Weld County in the case of Clean Wisconsin v. EPA, No. 18-1203, in which the D.C. Circuit remanded the boundary determination to the EPA for further support or re-designation. In response, the EPA chose to re-designate the boundary for the 2015 ozone NAAQS to include all of Weld County, which action became effective on December 30, 2021. Weld County has challenged the EPA’s action upon remand in the D.C. Circuit, and the case is pending briefing on the merits and is not likely to be decided until late 2022 or early 2023. Bd. of County Comm. of Weld County v. EPA, No. 21-1263. Finally, a “severe” non-attainment status designation for the DM/NFR by the EPA appears likely for the 2008 NAAQS in early 2022 due to violations at area monitors during the 2020 ozone season. A “severe” classification would trigger significant additional obligations under the CAA and state statute and will result in new and more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations and significant operating costs and delays in obtaining necessary permits for new and modified production facilities. Among other requirements, a “severe” classification for the 2008 NAAQS may require additional permitting in the nonattainment area for any source with the potential to emit more than 25 tons per year of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides. 
In May 2016, the EPA also finalized a rule regarding source determination, including defining the term “adjacent” under the CAA, which affects how major sources are defined, particularly regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed major sources, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. These EPA rulemakings will have nominal effect on our operations, because the rule clarified our existing presumption on “adjacent” and presents no conflict with the state of Colorado definitions.
The EPA also published Control Technique Guidelines (“CTGs”) in October 2016 aimed at providing states with guidance and setting a presumptive floor for Reasonably Achievable Control Technology (“RACT”) for the oil and gas industry in areas of ozone non-attainment, including the DM/NFR area. In November 2017, as required following issuance of the CTGs, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission AQCC adopted additional RACT and other air quality regulations that increased emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in the DM/NFR area, and to some extent state-wide.
State Air Regulation
In February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Quality Control Commission (“AQCC”) adopted new and revised air quality regulations that imposed stringent new requirements to control emissions from both existing and new or modified oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The regulations included new emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as a Leak Detection and Repair (“LDAR”) program for well production facilities and compressor stations. The LDAR program primarily targets hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the oil and gas sector in Colorado and represents a significant new use of state authority regarding these emissions. 
In December 2019, the AQCC adopted new and revised air quality regulations that extended the controls adopted in 2014 to many lower producing and emitting facilities statewide, and added storage tank loadout controls to those requirements, among other changes. The new rules also increased the frequency of LDAR monitoring to semi-annual for lower producing facilities previously subject to a one-time monitoring requirement, as well as monthly LDAR monitoring for facilities within 1,000 ft. of occupied areas, and imposed a new emission inventory and reporting of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), among other requirements. Some of these new requirements became effective as early as January 30, 2020, with others requiring compliance by May 1, 2020, or May 1, 2021. Colorado’s Air Quality Control Commission also revised rules specific to the oil and gas sector in September 2020, and again in December 2020. The September 2020 rules revisions included emission control requirements for natural gas fired engines typically in compression service, for pre-production tanks used in flowback, and also established a preproduction air monitoring plan requirement for operators for the first time. The December 2020 regulatory changes also included further revisions to LDAR monitoring requirements within 1,000 ft. of occupied areas. 
In February 2021, the AQCC also adopted regulations requiring the use of non-emitting pneumatic controllers at both new and existing facilities. This requirement is based on a company-wide percentage of pneumatic controllers being non-emitting. Additionally, in December 2021, the AQCC adopted still further air emissions control requirements specific to the oil and natural gas industry including increased LDAR monitoring frequencies, additional pneumatic controller emissions reduction and elimination requirements, enclosed combustion device testing requirements, and company-wide GHG intensity reductions, among other things. These updated regulations are aimed in substantial part at achieving GHG and conventional pollutant emission reductions from Colorado’s oil and gas industry in response to legislative directives, including Colorado House Bill 19-1261, which set ambitious GHG emission targets, and House Bill 21-1266, which modified those targets, among other things. 
Each of the above AQCC rulemakings are intended to further Colorado’s legislative directive to reduce GHG emissions to attain climate action goals. AQCC is expected to undertake several rulemaking efforts to further reduce emissions in the next several years.
In November 2020, the COGCC adopted new regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas during drilling, completion, and production operations, with limited exceptions, using its expanded oil and gas conservation and environmental protection authority under Colorado Senate Bill 19-181, discussed herein. Among other things, these regulations require that operators proposing new oil and gas wells either commit to connecting to a gathering system when production commences or submit a gas capture plan. 
Compliance with these and other air pollution control, gas capture and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Hydraulic fracturing
Regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing. We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing specifically are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.
States have historically regulated oil and gas exploration and production activity, including hydraulic fracturing. The state government where we operate has adopted or is considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration, the disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing, or other matters. Colorado, for example, requires operators to reduce hydrocarbon emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, prepare and report significant data regarding oil and gas impacts, compile and report additional information regarding wellbore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, maintain minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, and implement additional groundwater testing. Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions to our operations.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment, or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids, primarily via disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) wells, is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory or the state’s environmental authority. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” but disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water or their injection for EOR is not excluded. 
Federal agencies have periodically considered additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has published guidance for issuing underground injection permits that would regulate hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel. This guidance eventually could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. As noted above, in June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations that address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works, and after a legal challenge by environmental groups, in July 2019, the EPA declined to revise the rules. The EPA also published a study of the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016, which concluded that drinking water resources can be affected by hydraulic fracturing under specific circumstances. The results of this study could result in additional regulations, which could lead to operational burdens similar to those described above. The United States Department of the Interior also finalized a rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, wellbore integrity, and handling of flowback water; however, on December 29, 2017, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule. This rescission and the rule as promulgated are subject to ongoing litigation. Additionally, in early 2016, the BLM proposed rules related to further controlling the venting and flaring of natural gas on BLM land. Following the adoption of these rules in late 2016, a group led by the states of Wyoming and Montana, later joined by North Dakota and Texas, challenged the rules in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. On September 28, 2018, the BLM published a final rule that revised the 2016 rules. The new rule, among other things, rescinded the 2016 rule requirements related to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, well completion and related operations, pneumatic controllers, pneumatic diaphragm pumps, storage vessels, and leak detection and repair. The new rule also revised provisions related to venting and flaring. Environmental groups and the states of California and New Mexico filed challenges to the 2018 rule in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In July of 2020, the California court vacated the 2018 revisions but stayed its vacatur of the rules for 90 days. On October 8, 2020, before the 90-day stay of the California court’s vacatur expired, the Wyoming court struck down the 2016 rules on the grounds that the BLM exceeded its statutory authority by adopting rules to protect air quality, a role delegated to the EPA. The federal government appealed the decision from California and the citizen groups, New Mexico, and California appealed the decision from Wyoming. The Spring 2021 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, published by the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, identified a potential proposal by the BLM to update its existing rules governing the venting and flaring of natural gas from onshore Federal and Indian oil and gas leases. The BLM has not yet published such a proposed rule. Future litigation regarding the 2016 and 2018 rules and any alternative future rule therefore creates some uncertainty as to how BLM’s regulation of venting and flaring will impact our business.
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, some state and local governments have adopted their own new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. At the state level, voters in Colorado have proposed or advanced initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in Colorado, but these initiatives have failed to date. Further, Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 amended state law to give municipalities and counties greater local control over siting and permitting of oil and gas locations, and some municipalities within the state have implemented regulations within their jurisdictions. Any successful bans or moratoriums where we operate, whether at the state or local level, could increase the costs of our operations, impact our profitability, and even prevent us from drilling in certain locations which could threaten our production targets. In addition, in light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators have adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities or the underground injection of fluid wastes. For example, the regulations that the COGCC adopted in November 2020 impose various new requirements on the underground injection of fluid wastes to further seismic safety and protect the environment. Any regulation that restricts our ability to dispose of produced waters or increases the cost of doing business could have a material adverse effect on our business.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of recent state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products. We cannot assure that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.
Our use of hydraulic fracturing. We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize production of oil and gas from formations having low permeability such that natural flow is restricted. Fracture stimulation has been used for decades in the Rocky Mountain region.
Typical hydraulic fracturing treatments are made up of water, chemical additives, and sand. We utilize major hydraulic fracturing service companies who track and report additive chemicals that are used in fracturing as required by the appropriate government agencies, including FracFocus, the national hydraulic fracturing chemical registry managed by the Ground Water Protection Council and Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. Each of the service companies we use fracture stimulate a multitude of wells for the industry each year.
We periodically review our plans and policies regarding oil and gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, in order to minimize any potential environmental impact. Our operations are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM with respect to federal acreage), who frequently inspect our fracturing operations.
Other State Laws
Our properties located in Colorado are subject to the authority of the COGCC, as well as other state agencies. The COGCC finalized new flowline rules in February 2018. The new rules include increased registration requirements, flowline design requirements, integrity management requirements, leak detection programs, and requirements for abandonment of flowlines. In November 2019, the COGCC further amended its flowline rules to impose additional requirements regarding flowline mapping, operational status, certification, and abandonment, among other things. Over the past several years, the COGCC has also approved new rules regarding various other matters, including wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control, waste management, spill reporting, spacing of wells and pooling of mineral interests, and an increase in potential sanctions for COGCC rule violations. 
In 2016, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont do not have authority to ban oil and gas operations within their jurisdictional limits. In January 2019, in Martinez v. COGCC, the Colorado Supreme Court rejected an argument that Colorado’s oil and gas statute contained a requirement that COGCC condition new oil and gas development on a finding of no cumulative adverse impacts to public health and the environment. In April 2019, Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 (SB 181) became effective, which substantially changes the state’s regulation of oil and gas exploration and production activities and was enacted in partial response to the Fort Collins/Longmont and Martinez decisions. SB 181 changes the COGCC's mission from “fostering” responsible and balanced development “consistent with protection” of public health and the environment to “regulating” development “to protect” public health and the environment. SB 181 also instituted several state-wide regulatory changes, namely (i) changed the composition of the COGCC to remove two seats for industry experts and add experts on wildlife/environmental protection and public health, and changed the Commissioners’ employment from volunteer to full-time positions, (ii) changed Colorado’s statutory pooling provisions to require that an applicant own, or obtain the consent of, more than 45% of the applicable working or mineral interest, whereas previously the consent of only one 
mineral interest owner was required, (iii) changed state pre-emption law such to afford local governments greater control over oil and gas siting, and (iv) initiated a comprehensive rulemaking to amend COGCC’s rules consistent with the agency’s revised mission.
Among the most significant changes under SB 181 was the aforementioned provision giving local governments greater control over facility siting and surface impacts associated with oil and gas development. Whether an applicable local government determines to implement regulatory changes is optional, but if changes are adopted, the resulting regulations may be stricter than state requirements. Further, local governments may now inspect oil and gas operations and impose fines for leaks, spills, and emissions. Regulation in the municipalities and areas where we operate could result in increased costs, delays in securing permits and other approvals related to our operations, and otherwise materially bear on our ability to operate and drill new wells in the areas where we hold oil and gas interests. At this time, it impossible to estimate the potential impact on our business of future local actions on our ability to operate and/or drill oil and gas wells in these areas. 
The COGCC has adopted significant additional regulations to implement SB 181 as part of its historic “mission change” rulemaking. The legislation mandated COGCC rulemaking on environmental protection, facility siting, cumulative impacts, flowlines, wells that are inactive, temporarily abandoned, or shut-in, financial assurance, wellbore integrity, and application fees. The COGCC completed rulemaking on flowlines and wells that are inactive, temporarily abandoned, or shut-in in November 2019, completed rulemaking on wellbore integrity in June 2020, and completed a major rulemaking on the COGCC’s “mission change” in November 2020. The mission change rulemaking was intended to align the regulations to the COGCC’s new mission. It addressed a wide range of topics including facility siting, cumulative impacts, development approvals, asset transfers, pollution standards, hearings and variances, groundwater monitoring, underground injection control and enhanced recovery wells, venting and flaring restrictions, spill reporting, cleanup responsibility, and wildlife protection. The mission change rules took effect on January 15, 2021, and they apply to permit applications pending on or submitted after that date and generally to operations occurring on or after that date. The agency is currently in the process of issuing written guidance on many of the issues addressed to provide direction on regulatory interpretation and compliance. The COGCC has undertaken rulemaking on financial assurance, application fees, and high priority habitat during 2021 that is expected to conclude in early 2022. It is expected a result of the financial assurance rulemaking will be to increase the amounts that operators are required to provide as a surety bond for assurance that wells will be properly plugged and abandoned at the end of their lifecycle. Depending on how these and any other new rules are applied and enforced, they could add substantial increases in well costs for our Colorado operations. The rules could also impact our ability to operate and extend the time necessary to obtain drilling permits, which would create substantial uncertainty about our ability to meet future drilling plans and thus production and capital expenditure targets. 
SB 181 also required the state’s AQCC to undertake rulemaking efforts to minimize methane emissions and emissions of other hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides associated with certain oil and gas facilities. The AQCC adopted more stringent standards for leak detection and repair inspection frequency, pipeline and compressor station inspection and maintenance frequencies, and for reducing emissions from pneumatic devices, and expanded storage tank control and loadout control requirements applicable statewide in December 2019, as noted above. The legislation also grants the AQCC regulatory authority over a broad range of oil and gas facilities during pre-production activities, drilling and completion.
Hazardous substances and waste handling
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that transported, disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially responsible parties may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as or contain CERCLA hazardous substances but we are not aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes, and distinguishes between hazardous and non-hazardous or solid wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent hazardous waste requirements, while all states regulate solid waste. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of natural gas and oil are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions and state solid waste laws. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent and costly handling, disposal, and clean-up requirements. For example, in May 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that sought to compel the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise its regulations regarding existing exemptions for exploration and production related wastes. On December 28, 2016, the EPA entered into a consent decree with those environmental groups to settle the lawsuit, which required the EPA by March 15, 2019 to either propose new regulations regarding exploration and production related wastes or sign a determination that revision of such regulations is not necessary. Pursuant to the consent decree, the EPA determined in April 2019 that revision of the regulations is unnecessary. The EPA indicated that it will continue to work with states and other organizations to identify areas for continued improvement and to address emerging issues to ensure that exploration, development, and production wastes continue to be managed in a manner that protects human health and the environment. Environmental groups, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the EPA’s decision and will likely continue to press the issue at the federal and state levels, especially under the new Biden Administration.
In 2018, the Colorado State legislature passed Senate Bill 245 that gave the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (“CDPHE”) the authority to promulgate rules for the safe management of Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (“TENORM”). TENORM is naturally occurring radioactive material whose radionuclide concentrations are increased through human activity, such as through generation of water treatment residuals, scales and sediments from oil and gas production, and other processes. The bill required the Department to review TENORM residual management and regulatory limits from other states as well as prepare a report that considers background radiation levels in the state, waste stream identification and quantification, use and disposal practices, current engineering practices, appropriate test methods, economic impacts, and data gaps. This work was completed by CDPHE in 2019. During 2020, CDPHE promulgated new rules governing TENORM waste, which were adopted in November 2020 and became effective January 14, 2021, but are not enforceable until July 14, 2022, to provide operators time to come into compliance. During drilling, completion, and production, numerous waste streams that may contain TENORM are created that are hauled for disposal at permitted disposal facilities. CDPHE is developing three guidance documents and holding stakeholder meetings to help impacted facility operators characterize existing materials, make a TENORM determination and prepare for compliance with the new rules in 2022. Depending on the final waste streams chosen for characterization and regulatory levels set for disposal, costs for characterization, storage, and disposal of waste could significantly increase.
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore for and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, exploration and production fluids and gases may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators), to pay for damages for the loss or impairment of natural resources, and to take measures to prevent future contamination from our operations.
In addition, other laws require the reporting on use of hazardous and toxic chemicals. For example, in October 2015, the EPA granted, in part, a petition filed by several national environmental advocacy groups to add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain “toxic chemicals” under the Toxic Release Inventory (“TRI”) program under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The EPA determined that natural gas processing facilities may be appropriate for addition to TRI applicable facilities and in January 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program. In November 2021, the EPA added natural gas processing facilities to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the TRI Program. This rule expands coverage to include all natural gas processing facilities that receive and refine natural gas, not just those operated primarily to recover sulfur, which were already included.
Pipeline safety and maintenance
Pipelines, gathering systems, and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. Both the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant penalties, liability for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. The U.S. Department of Transportation has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection, and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
There have been recent initiatives to strengthen and expand pipeline safety regulations and to increase penalties for violations. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was signed into law in early 2012. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has issued new rules to strengthen federal pipeline safety enforcement programs. In 2015, PHMSA proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including through the increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas. In 2016, PHMSA increased its regulations to require crude oil sampling and reporting as an “offeror” (as defined under the PHMSA) and increased its civil penalty structure. In November 2021, PHMSA issued its final rule extending reporting requirements to all onshore gas gathering operators and applying a set of minimum safety requirements to certain onshore gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures.
In Colorado, the Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) adopted amended Rules Regulating Pipeline Operators and Gas Pipeline Safety for intrastate pipelines on December 16, 2020. Following public and stakeholder comment, an Administrative Law Judge for the PUC issued a Recommended Decision on November 4, 2020, recommending that the PUC formally adopt proposed revisions. On March 17, 2021, Regulation 11 rules Regulating Pipeline Operators and Gas Pipeline Safety were adopted by the Public Utilities Commission. These regulations apply to all gas public utilities, all municipal or quasi-municipal corporations transporting natural gas or providing natural gas services, all operators of master meter systems, and all operators of pipelines transporting gas in intrastate commerce including gas gathering system operators (certain provisions are tailored to the location and size of the gathering systems involved). The rules require all filed reports to be publicly available and all Notices of Proposed Violation, Notices of Action, pleadings and decisions to be filed publicly. The rules also provide a revised methodology for calculating civil penalties in an effort to provide clarity to both operators and the public.
Climate change
Based on EPA findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, established Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction, and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major sources of emissions of regulated air pollutants. In a subsequent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of the EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but also invalidated a portion of it, holding that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG BACT requirements, but that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with the EPA’s GHG Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”) requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, the EPA issued a proposed rule to further revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings, including a proposed de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. This rulemaking process was not finalized. If the EPA promulgates new rules under the Biden Administration, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, and may also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the EPA’s GHG emissions reporting rule and Colorado’s GHG emissions inventory and reporting rules more recently adopted.
In August of 2015, the EPA finalized rules to further reduce GHG emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants, under its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”). On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the CPP regulations. Following the Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was formally reviewing the CPP. On October 9, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the Clean Power Plan and on July 8, 2019, the EPA finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which established emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule replaced the CPP and provided states with new emission guidelines that informed their development of standards of performance to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. Long-pending legal challenges to the CPP rule filed by states, industry and environmental groups were dismissed as moot by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on September 17, 2019, given the issuance of a final replacement ACE rule. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit struck down the ACE Rule and remanded it to the EPA, which has stated power sector regulation of GHGs is a high priority, but has not indicated when a replacement rule might be forthcoming. 
On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit’s decision striking down the ACE rule in four distinct petitions. In its review of these cases, the Supreme Court will examine the scope of the EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. While the Supreme Court’s ruling in these cases will be specific to the power sector, it could also have legal implications for other existing sources of GHGs, like those in the oil and natural gas exploration sector.
Congress has, from time to time, considered but not yet passed legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. 
Additional GHG regulation may also result from the December 2015 agreement that the United States reached during the December 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, France (the “Paris Agreement”). Within the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce its GHG emissions by 26-28% by the year 2025 as compared with 2005 levels, and provide periodic updates on its progress. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Although former President Trump's announced withdrawal finally took effect on November 4, 2020, among President Biden's first actions was the issuance of an executive order and the provision of 30-day advance notice to the United Nations of the United States' return to the Paris Agreement. The U.S. returned to participation in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of the Parties held in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, advancing a Global Methane Pledge along with the European Union, which over 100 countries representing almost 70% of global GDP have signed, among other initiatives, pledges and agreements.
On May 30, 2019, Colorado also passed GHG inventory legislation and climate action legislation. House Bill 19-1261 concerns the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution and established statewide greenhouse gas pollution reduction goals. Senate Bill 19-096 concerns the collection of greenhouse gas emissions data to facilitate measures to cost-effectively meet the states GHG emissions reduction goals established in HB 19-1261. Regulations implementing the GHG inventory requirements of these statutes were promulgated by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission in May of 2020 and became effective on July 15, 2020. Additionally, on September 30, 2020, the Colorado Energy Office and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment released a draft Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap for public comment and finalized the document on January 14, 2021. The GHG Roadmap lays out a pathway to meet the state's climate action targets established in HB 19-1261, as amended by HB 21-1266.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting, emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Severe limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect our production operations and/or demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could also reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. As well, as an oil and gas producer there are potential reputational risks and negative perceptions associated with our operations and the growing concern around GHG emissions and climate change.
Water discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into certain surface waters of the U.S., including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. As properties are acquired, we determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, will develop or update such plans to implement physical and operation controls, the costs of which are not expected to be material. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) adopted a new regulatory definition of jurisdictional “waters of the U.S.” (“WOTUS”), which was repealed by the EPA on October 22, 2019, restoring the 1986 regulatory definition of “Waters of the United States,” – step one of a two-step process. Then in January 2020, the EPA and the Corps released the Navigable Waters Protection Rule which updated the federal definition for a WOTUS – the second step in the two-step process to repeal and replace the 2015 rule – and published the final rule on April 21, 2020. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule went into effect on June 22, 2020, but numerous environmental, agricultural and business groups and state governments challenged the rule in various courts, and the rule was vacated by two separate federal district courts in late 2021. On November 18, 2021, the EPA and the Corps issued a pre-publication version of another WOTUS rule largely reinstating the previous 1986 WOTUS rule and guidance “with certain amendments” to reflect “consideration of the agencies’ statutory authority under the CWA and relevant Supreme Court decisions” (the “2021 Proposed Rule”). The 2021 Proposed Rule was published in the Federal Register on December 7, 2021. 
In addition to the 2021 Proposed Rule, the EPA and the Corps plan to develop yet another amendment to the WOTUS regulations, which will build upon the regulatory foundation in the 2021 Proposed Rule with the benefit of additional stakeholder engagement and public input. It is unknown at this time when the 2021 Proposed Rule will take effect; when the next forthcoming proposed amendments are expected; and/or whether either new rule will be challenged and withstand any challenges in federal court. 
In May 2020, a federal court in Montana enjoined the use of nationwide permit (“NWP”) 12 to construct new oil and gas-related pipelines, on the basis that the Corps had not properly consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service when that permit was renewed in 2017 (the court later amended its ruling to allow use of NWP 12 for non-oil and gas transmission projects). The U.S. Supreme Court in July 2020 significantly narrowed the Montana court’s injunction to cover only the challenged XL Pipeline. On August 11, 2021, the Ninth Circuit granted partial vacatur of the Corps’ appeal of the Montana district court’s opinion, holding the claim before it (the interlocutory appeals and underlying claim relative to the pipeline, which has been halted) was moot, but left to the district court the question of whether the case was moot in its entirety.
In the meantime, in September 2020 and again in January 2021, the Corps issued proposals to revise and reissue all 52 current NWPs, including No. 12, to, among other things, lessen the burden on the energy industry and address the flaws alleged in the Montana lawsuit. Although there are small differences in the September 2020 and January 2021 proposals, they do not impact the changes described below, particularly with NWP 12. The new NWPs became effective in March 2021.
Among other things, under the new NWPs, existing NWP 12 was broken up into three new separate NWPs, with the new NWP 12 being limited solely to construction and maintenance of oil and gas pipelines, with other utility-related structures covered by the two new NWPs (i.e., NWP 57 for electric utility line and telecommunications activities and NWP 58 for utility line activities for water and other substances). The new 2021 version of NWP 12 has again been challenged in the District of Montana, by the same plaintiffs on the same grounds, which case is still pending. If the 2021 version of NWP 12 ultimately is invalidated or stayed by the courts, it could increase the costs and delays for oil and gas operators to construct or maintain pipelines that cross jurisdictional WOTUS.
Finally, in January 2022, the United States Supreme Court granted review of Sackett vs. EPA, which involves issues related to CWA scope and jurisdiction and could impact the current rulemaking process. Although the outcome of the 2021 Proposed Rule and additional forthcoming amendments to the WOTUS regulations are unknown, the regulations under the Biden Administration will undoubtedly be more stringent in terms of the scope of WOTUS, which could ultimately change the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction and result in increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for discharges of pollutants or dredge and fill activities in waters of the U.S., including regulated wetland areas.
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. In August 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”) and National Marine Fisheries Service issued three rules amending implementation of the ESA regulations revising, among other things, the process for listing species and designating critical habitat. A coalition of states and environmental groups have challenged the three rules and the litigation remains pending. In addition, on December 18, 2020, the FWS amended its regulations governing critical habitat designations. We anticipate the rule will be subject to litigation. A final rule amending how critical habitat and suitable habitat areas are designated was finalized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), which makes it illegal to, among other things, hunt, capture, kill, possess, sell, or purchase migratory birds, nests, or eggs without a permit. This prohibition covers most bird species in the U.S. On January 7, 2021, the Department of the Interior finalized a rule limiting application of the MBTA, however the Department of the Interior under President Biden delayed the effective date of the rule and opened a public comment period for further review. Based on that review, the Department of Interior published a final rule on October 4, 2021, revoking the January 7, 2021, regulations that limited the scope of the MBTA. With this revocation of the January 7, 2021 rule, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service returns to implementing the MBTA as prohibiting incidental take and applying enforcement discretion, consistent with long-standing agency practice prior to 2017. This final rule went into effect on December 3, 2021. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Employee health and safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. In 2016, there were substantial revisions to the regulations under OSHA that may impact our operations. These changes include among other items: record keeping and reporting, a revised crystalline silica standard (which requires the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021), naming oil and gas as a high hazard industry, and requirements for a safety and health management system. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. In November 2021, OSHA issued a Temporary Emergency Standard (“TES”) with respect to COVID-19 vaccination or masking and testing. The TES was withdrawn as an enforceable temporary emergency standard on January 26, 2022; however, OSHA has not withdrawn the TES as a proposed rule and is focused on finalizing a permanent COVID-19 standard for General Industry.
National Environmental Policy Act
Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major federal actions having the potential to significantly impact the human environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will evaluate the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a detailed environmental impact statement that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. The vast majority of our exploration and production activities are not on federal lands. This environmental review process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of natural gas and oil projects on federal lands. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which can delay or halt projects. On July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) revised NEPA’s implementing regulations to make the NEPA process more efficient, effective, and timely. The final rule requires federal agencies to develop procedures consistent with the new rule within one year of the rule’s effective date. The new regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in several federal district courts, and on October 7, 2021, CEQ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the NEPA regulatory changes adopted in 2020 in two phases. Where Phase I of the CEQ’s proposed rulemaking process would generally restore provisions that were in effect prior to 2020, it is anticipated that Phase II of the proposed rulemaking would propose further revisions to ensure the NEPA process “provides for efficient and effective environmental reviews,” and meets environmental, environmental justice, and climate change objectives. The CEQ’s proposed changes could result in increased NEPA review timelines for projects involving agency action regarding federal lands, federal money, or federal permits or approvals.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that release oil into waters of the U.S. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the U.S. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. The OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
