ITEM 1     BUSINESS
Weyco Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) engage in one line of business: the design and distribution of quality and innovative footwear. The Company designs and markets footwear principally for men, but also for women and children, under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names including: Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, BOGS, Rafters, and Forsake. Trademarks maintained by the Company on its brands are important to the business. The Company’s products consist primarily of mid-priced leather dress shoes and casual footwear composed of man-made materials or leather, as well as outdoor boots, shoes, and sandals. The Company’s footwear is available in a broad range of sizes and widths, primarily purchased to meet the needs and desires of the general American population.
On June 7, 2021, the Company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and certain liabilities of Forsake, Inc. Forsake will join BOGS as part of the Company's outdoor division. Forsake designs and markets modern outdoor footwear, including hiking shoes and sneakerboots, under the brand name "Forsake." Its products are sold primarily in outdoor specialty stores and on e-commerce websites throughout North America. Management believes that Forsake fits well into the Company's strategy to diversify its product mix and build its presence in the outdoor footwear market. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the acquisition.
The Company purchases finished shoes from outside suppliers, primarily located in China and India, but has also expanded into Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. Almost all of these foreign-sourced purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the Company sources from more than 60 suppliers, two individual suppliers each accounted for slightly more than 10% of its total inventory purchases in 2021. Costs from the Company’s suppliers have historically been relatively stable although, in recent years, there have been upward cost pressures due to higher freight, labor, and materials costs, as well as due to tariffs and other trade protection measures. In particular, during 2021 the Company experienced higher freight costs due to supply chain bottlenecks, which have not yet fully resolved.
The Company’s business is separated into two reportable segments – the North American wholesale segment (“Wholesale”) and the North American retail segment (“Retail”). The Company also has other wholesale and retail businesses overseas which include its businesses in Australia, South Africa and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”), and its wholesale and retail businesses in Europe (“Florsheim Europe”). In late 2020, the Company decided to close Florsheim Europe and management is in the final stages of winding down this business.
Sales of the Company’s wholesale segment, which include both wholesale sales and worldwide licensing revenues, constituted 77% and 78% of total net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. At wholesale, shoes are marketed throughout the United States and Canada in more than 10,000 shoe, clothing and department stores. In 2021 and 2020, no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s total net sales. The Company employs traveling salespeople and independent sales representatives who sell the Company’s products to retail outlets. Shoes are shipped to these retailers primarily from the Company’s distribution center in Glendale, Wisconsin. In the men’s footwear business, there is generally no identifiable seasonality, although new styles are historically developed and shown twice each year, in spring and fall. With the BOGS brand, which mainly sells winter and outdoor boots, there is seasonality in its business due to the nature of the product; the majority of BOGS sales occur in the third and fourth quarters. Consistent with industry practices, the Company carries significant amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements and periodically provides extended payment terms to customers. The Company also has licensing agreements with third parties who sell its branded shoes outside of the United States, as well as licensing agreements with specialty shoe, apparel and accessory manufacturers in the United States.
Sales of the Company’s retail segment constituted 12% and 11% of total net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The retail segment consists of e-commerce businesses and four brick and mortar stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to consumers on the Company’s websites, or by Company employees. The Company believes that as a result of the reduction in brick and mortar stores, the future results of its U.S. retail segment will be driven by its more profitable e-commerce businesses. Management intends to continue to focus on investing in and growing the e-commerce businesses.
Sales of the Company’s other businesses constituted 11% of total net sales in both 2021 and 2020. These sales relate to the Company’s wholesale and retail operations in Australia, South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed 608 persons worldwide, of whom 439 were full-time employees. 
Price, quality, service and brand recognition are all important competitive factors in the shoe industry. The Company has a design department that continually reviews and updates product designs. Compliance with environmental and other government regulations
