Business Plan
 
Our current business plan is to seek and identify appropriate business opportunity for development of our new line of business. We have no capital and must depend on the resources of our shareholders to provide us with the necessary funds to implement our business plan. We intend to seek opportunities demonstrating

the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition or merger.
 
Our Board of Directors will be primarily responsible for investigating combination opportunities. However, we believe that business opportunities may also come to our attention from various sources, including professional advisors such as attorneys, and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us.
 
No direct discussions regarding the possibility of a combination are currently ongoing and we can give no assurances that we will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity. Furthermore, we can give no assurances that any acquisition, if it occurs, will be on terms that are favorable to us or our current stockholders.
 
We do not propose to restrict our search for business opportunity to any particular geographical area or industry, and therefore, we are unable to predict the nature of our future business operations. Our management's discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities
 
Certain types of business acquisition transactions may be completed without requiring us to first submit the transaction to our stockholders for their approval. If the proposed transaction is structured in such a fashion our stockholders (other than our majority stockholder) will not be provided with financial or other information relating to the candidate prior to the completion of the transaction.
 
If a proposed business combination or business acquisition transaction is structured that requires our stockholder approval, and we are a reporting company, we will be required to provide our stockholders with information as applicable under Regulations 14A and 14C under the Exchange Act.
 
The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our Board of Directors. In analyzing potential merger candidates, our management will consider, among other things, the following factors:
 
·
Potential for future earnings and appreciation of value of securities;

·
Perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by our stockholders;

·
Historical results of operation;

·
Liquidity and availability of capital resources;

·
Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;

·
Strength and diversity of existing management or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment;

·
Amount of debt and contingent liabilities; and

·
The products and/or services and marketing concepts of the target business

There is no single factor that will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity. Our management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business opportunity to be acquired.
 
We are unable to predict when we may participate in a business opportunity. We expect, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months.
 
Prior to making a decision to participate in a business transaction, we will generally request that we be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as much relevant information as possible, including, but not limited to, a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if audited financial statements are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able to be produced to comply with the requirements of a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or Commission, upon consummation of the business combination.
 
As part of our investigation, our directors may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain provided information, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial and management resources.
