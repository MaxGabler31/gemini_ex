Item 1. Business.
Overview
Drive Shack Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed in 2002, and its common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “DS.” Drive Shack Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referenced herein as "Drive Shack Inc.", "the Company", "we", or "our". The Company owns and operates golf-related leisure and entertainment venues and courses focused on bringing people together through competitive socializing, by combining sports and entertainment with elevated food and beverage offerings. The Company conducts its business through the following segments: (i) entertainment golf, (ii) traditional golf and (iii) corporate. For a further discussion of the reportable segments, see Note 4. 
•Entertainment golf | Drive Shack and Puttery
Drive Shack offers competitive, social entertainment through its golf-related leisure and large-format entertainment venues with gaming and premier golf technology, a chef-inspired menu, craft cocktails, and engaging social events throughout the year. Each Drive Shack venue features expansive, climate-controlled, suite style bays with lounge seating; augmented-reality golf games and virtual course play; a restaurant and multiple bars; an outdoor patio with lawn games; and arcade games.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company operated four Drive Shack venues located in Orlando, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia. Additionally, the Company is committed to a lease in Manhattan (Randall’s Island), New York for a Drive Shack venue. Drive Shack venues are freestanding, 50,000 - 60,000 square feet, open-air venues built on approximately 12 acres.
This segment also includes the Company's newest entertainment golf brand, Puttery, an adult-focused, modern spin on putting, re-defining the game within an immersive experience and innovative technology as guests move from one course to the next. With a high-energy atmosphere that combines plentiful curated culinary offerings and inventive craft cocktails centered around a lively bar area with great music, guests can relax and enjoy their evening before, during and after their tee time. Puttery venues range in size from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet and feature indoor putting courses anchored by bars and other social spaces that serve to create engaging and fun experiences for guests.
The Company launched its first Puttery venue in September 2021 in The Colony, Texas. As of December 31, 2021, the Company operated two leased Puttery venues located in The Colony, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina. The Company is committed to eight additional Puttery leases for venues in Washington, DC, Miami, Houston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York City (Manhattan), and Kansas City. Puttery venues are indoor venues typically located in urban and suburban dining and entertainment districts.
•Traditional golf | American Golf 
American Golf, acquired by the Company in December 2013, is one of the largest operators of golf properties in the United States. As an owner, lessee, and manager of golf courses and country clubs for over 45 years, we believe American Golf is one of the most experienced operators in the traditional golf industry. As of December 31, 2021, we owned, leased or managed 55 properties across nine states. American Golf is focused on delivering lasting experiences for our guests, with over 35,000 members and over 1.6 million rounds played at our properties during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Public Properties.   Our twenty-eight (28) leased public properties generate revenues principally through daily green fees, golf cart rentals and food, beverage and merchandise sales.  Amenities at these properties generally include practice facilities, pro shops and food and beverage facilities.  At certain locations, our public properties have larger clubhouses with extensive banquet facilities. In addition, The Players Club is a fee-based monthly membership program offered at most of our public properties, with membership benefits ranging from daily range access and off-peak course access to the ability to participate in golf clinics.
Private Properties.   Our five (5) leased or owned private properties, which are open primarily to members and their guests, generate revenues principally through initiation fees, membership dues, food, beverage and merchandise sales, and guest fees. Amenities at these properties typically include practice facilities, full-service clubhouses with a pro shop, locker room facilities and multiple food and beverage outlets, including grills, restaurants and banquet facilities.
Managed Properties. Our twenty-two (22) managed properties are operated by American Golf pursuant to management agreements with the owners of each property.  We recognize revenue from each of these properties in an amount equal to a management fee and the reimbursements of certain operating costs.
During 2021, the Company exited a total of three management agreements and two leases that had expired, bringing our total number of managed properties to twenty-two (22) and leased properties to thirty-two (32).
See Note 5 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Growth Strategy
We believe Drive Shack Inc. is the only company comprised of a truly integrated portfolio of both entertainment and traditional golf businesses, which provides us with a unique opportunity to unlock top site locations by leveraging the operational experiences and municipal relationships developed by our traditional golf business. The Company strives to forward innovate and revolutionize next generation experiences. In September 2021, the Company launched Puttery, its newest competitive indoor socializing and entertainment platform.
We expect Puttery to expand our business by diversifying our experiential offerings with an adult-focused modern spin on putting through innovative technology featuring a series of indoor putting courses anchored by bars and other social spaces that will serve to create engaging and fun experiences for our guests. Our Puttery venues require much less space than a Drive Shack venue at approximately 15,000 - 20,000 square feet of indoor new or existing retail space. Puttery expands store potential by hundreds of markets due to the vast availability of real estate, shorter development timelines, less capital risk and higher development yields. We believe that advanced data and demographic analytics will allow us to strategically evaluate and develop a robust pipeline of target sites in prioritized markets across the United States. As we look to further grow our Puttery brand, the smaller format offers us the opportunity to improve investment returns and take advantage of the vast availability of retail space at favorable rates.
As we build our brand through the existing operation of Drive Shack locations and new Puttery locations, we continue to strengthen our position in this growing industry. We believe there is significant opportunity to capture market share given the industry disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the structural decline of dated businesses, coupled with the rising demand for social and interactive entertainment options. We have strategically aligned our Drive Shack and Puttery businesses to provide competitive, social and interactive experiences to capitalize on this unique and timely opportunity, as we feel other entertainment concepts in our industry have failed to address the shift in consumer preferences. There are a variety of consumers who seek out active socializing options. We will use data and testing to understand unique drivers, test consumer behaviors, and understand spending habits, seeking to optimize the most effective way to target, acquire, and retain consumers.
In addition to our first two Puttery locations in The Colony and Charlotte, we currently have executed lease agreements with landlords to develop additional locations in Washington, DC, Miami, Chicago, Houston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City (Manhattan), and Kansas City. We continuously analyze the performance of our first two locations and if necessary, adjustments will be made, if necessary, to further refine our operational and financial models as we expand our Puttery national footprint. We plan to open seven locations during 2022 and expect to end the year with a total of nine Puttery venues in operation.
•A Modernized Socializing Experience
Current Consumer Preferences. Our portfolio of current and future entertainment venues directly addresses consumers’ changing preferences and provides a new type of leisure with multiple experiences under one roof, including:
•Social Entertainment – A unique and curated experience where guests can interact, compete and socialize in a sophisticated, fun setting.
•Sports – Technology forward activities and robust gaming platforms that promote competition and create unique and lasting experiences.
•Food & Beverage – A complete social experience is rounded out by exceptional food and beverage options. Along with heightened visual cues, craft cocktails and curated food choices will enhance the overall experience for every consumer.
•Inclusivity – An activity and experience that allows everyone to participate and enjoy, regardless of skill level.
Our focus is on creating an environment that enables sociable competition and connecting with friends and family, providing our guests with memorable and meaningful experiences. These experiences are designed to cater to a range of audiences and competitive appetites, to attract new guests and to drive loyalty and advocacy among our existing guests.
Innovation. Golf as a sport and form of entertainment continues to transform. We believe innovation is at the essence of creating the modernized, broadly appealing golf and entertainment experience. In an industry with a high degree of competition, innovation serves as a key differentiator. We strive to innovate across all our offerings including technology powered golf games, food and beverage menu offerings, and venue formats. Our proprietary gaming software allows us the ability to consistently develop and launch new games. 
Technology. Our Drive Shack venues are equipped with radar-based TrackMan™ technology, which provides precision ball tracking, in real time, affording us the ability to bring our augmented reality gaming to the next level. 
Our proprietary gaming software provides us with the unique ability to continuously develop and release cutting edge, fun and engaging games. Our current suite of proprietary games includes Darts, Monster Hunt, ShackJack, Pro Range and our newest game launched in 2021, Snowman. We refresh our existing games and supplement with new releases periodically. In addition, our partnership with TrackMan™ provides our guests with access to an extensive portfolio of world-famous virtual golf courses. These games and virtual golf courses are suitable for all skill sets and competitive appetites.
Elevated Food & Beverage. Our venues feature chef-inspired food offerings alongside inventive craft cocktails. Our menus feature a thoughtfully curated selection of shareable food options, further enabling the socializing nature of our venues. They are designed and tailored to consumer preferences and lifestyle trends, offering unique flavors, and high-quality fresh ingredients to create a premium selection of options to appeal to our broad range of guests. 
Alongside our food menu, we have a beverage offering that features a variety of beers, craft cocktails, non-alcoholic cocktails, canned wine and seltzers, and premium spirits. Our beer selection consists of local and regional craft beers and varies by venue locations. In certain locations, we have partnerships with local breweries which source and produce exclusive beverages in both our Drive Shack and Puttery venues. 
We plan to rollout new seasonal or limited time offerings, to supplement our core menu and give our guests more reasons to keep coming back as well as attract new guests. 
Events. Our venues provide an electric atmosphere for experiential event options spanning corporate events to social gatherings. Each Drive Shack venue features climate-controlled bays, 300-plus television screens, a rooftop terrace with fire pits, and private indoor and outdoor meeting spaces fully equipped with A/V technology and wi-fi, that can accommodate a variety of group sizes up to 1,200 guests. Our Puttery venues have dedicated VIP event spaces as well as other areas throughout each venue, such as lounge areas and outdoor patios. Our event packages feature an elevated chef-inspired catering menu and beverage packages, that are customizable to our guests. Our dedicated event team handles everything from planning to execution to create memorable and meaningful experiences for all our event participants.
•Site selection, development, and the experience
Site Selection. Our site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy and is led by our Real Estate Committee, integrating a variety of analytical measures with an evaluation of key factors of the overall quality and viability of potential sites. These factors include but are not limited to size and quality of land and existing real estate space; population demographics, such as target population density, age, and household income levels; competition levels in the market; site visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; proximity to other entertainment facilities, restaurants and bars; and market or landlord incentives.
Venue Development. Our Drive Shack venue formats are generally open-air 60,000 square feet venues on average built on approximately 12 to 15 acres of land. This format features 72 to 96 climate-controlled bays with lounge seating and an approximately 200 yard outfield. The total investment cost of a new Drive Shack venue ranges from $25 to $40 million. We may either enter into a long-term ground lease or purchase the land for our Drive Shack venue format. The average development time for our large format Drive Shack venue is 18 to 24 months.
We currently have a lease commitment in Manhattan (Randall’s Island), New York for a future Drive Shack entertainment golf venues. The Company continues to hold its lease in New Orleans, Louisiana, but suspended development activities for the venue during 2021 and, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is considering alternatives to the development of a Drive Shack venue on such site.

Our new Puttery venues average between 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of existing indoor space. These venues each feature anywhere from two to four uniquely themed nine-hole courses, depending on venue size and layout. The total investment cost of a Puttery venue is expected to range from $7 to $11 million, exclusive of landlord incentives. We believe the development timeline for a Puttery venue averages six to nine months and will vary based on the unique layout of each venue.
On occasion, we expect that our various venue formats may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than our targeted range, depending on the specific circumstances of the selected site or market. 
Transcending the Experience. We look to create meaningful and memorable experiences by combining world class golf technology, great drinks, delicious food and welcoming environments. Our Drive Shack venues are organized and designed to spread and amplify guest energy and revolutionize the golf and competitive socializing experience. We encourage guest interaction with other guests by way of carefully placed bars and lounges, social event areas, outdoor patios and climate-controlled bays. The lighting, finishes and furniture are contemporary yet comfortable and are purposely organized for group interaction and a social atmosphere. Whether a golfer or not we want everyone to feel comfortable experiencing our version of golf.
Our new Puttery venues consist of exciting, adult focused mini-golf and leisure spaces with social interaction in mind, character-filled with innovative interior designs (including course thematics consisting of libraries, lodges, redwood forests and cityscape rooftops). Each location is customized to create unique ways to socialize with friends for a night out, have drinks with colleagues or meet new people. These bar forward mini-golf spaces blend vintage putting with upscale casual lifestyle through the strategic placement of the lounges, bars, courses, and VIP spaces within each venue. The courses are intimate, transformative and designed specifically to keep guests connected and socializing while playing enhanced mini golf. Beverage and food opportunities are plentiful with multiple bars and a full-service kitchen. Our lounge furniture and finishes are all created with a comfortable yet upscale experience.
Marketing
•Growing Brand Awareness
Continuing to build and grow brand awareness is a top priority. Our strategy consists of multiple layers, which includes local and national data and demographic profiles to identify interests and behaviors, competitors and consumption habits of our target consumers. Our agency partners assist us in developing creative content and messaging that we believe will both continue to grow our Drive Shack and American Golf business and bring the Puttery brand successfully to market. Marketing is a full funnel strategy, including paid and earned media, digital, social, video, out-of-home, events, customer relationship management, influencer marketing, content creation, and celebrity collaboration. 
•Embracing Local Communities
Local Partnerships. Each Drive Shack venue prides itself on forging bonds with local partners in the community. For example, our Drive Shack location in Richmond partnered with a local brewery to create an exclusive premium beer for our venue, while our Drive Shack location in Raleigh has partnered with a local female-owned brewery. We have also collaborated with a local specialty ice cream shop to create a new scratch rendition of the classic ice cream sandwich inspired by Arnold Palmer, called the Chilly Palmer. We plan to continue to explore local partnerships and collaborations that may vary by venue and geographic location. 
•Customized Programming and Promotions
Unique Programs. Our guest experience is enhanced by ongoing events and programs designed to engage a range of guest desires, including quarterly Social Leagues and Summer Swing Academy, which introduces young kids to golf in a fun, relaxed environment. Intended to drive new and repeat guests to our venues, we feature Limited Time Offers ("LTOs") that are generally rolled out on a quarterly basis. The LTOs typically include three new food and three new beverage offerings that have been created and inspired by our talented chefs in each of our Drive Shack venues
We also have designed programming around seasonal events, including March Madness, National Beer Day, and Easter, with our family themed Easter Egg Hunt. We continually innovate new ways for guests to compete within the venue, such as our new, repeatable tournament model, Drive Shack Open, for use at our large format entertainment venues. The Drive Shack Open is geared towards more competitive, avid golfers and is structured as a single-day tournament, with four-person teams, a team entry fee and prizes awarded to teams based on scores. In December 2020, we debuted our first Drive Shack Open tournament, which was met with huge demand and sold out in advance of the tournament. Given its success, we have continued through 2021. We have also developed an in-venue tournament model, Monster Hunt Challenge, that is geared towards less serious players and non-golfers. The Monster Hunt Challenge is structured as a 4-week tournament model built specifically for competition with "high score" tournament mentality for both groups and solo players, with unlimited entries at a low cost per entry fee and prizes awarded based on highest score.
Promotional Campaigns. We periodically develop promotional programs to attract new guests and increase the length of stay and spend per visitor. Our promotional programs include Happy Hour specials, offering discounted food and beverage selections during specified periods of time as well as various holiday promotions. These promotions are intended to appeal to our existing guests and to encourage new guests to experience our version of golf in climate-controlled bays. We also launched a 2-Bay promotional package in Fall 2020 to address restrictions on large group gatherings. This promotional package allows groups of 10 guests or less to reserve two bays and includes a generous food and beverage credit and two hours of play for a reasonable set price. The promotion was successful during the height of COVID-related restrictions and we continue to offer this package today during non-peak seasonal times throughout the year. 
Intellectual Property
We have registered the trademarks Drive Shack®, Puttery® and American Golf® and their primary logos have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our trade names and our logos to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to accept an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential in connection with their onboarding process.
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities to raise cash financing, in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and any investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject in certain cases to NYSE shareholder approval requirements), to issue additional 
common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for cash or property.
Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete primarily on the basis of location, featured facilities, quality and breadth of product offerings and price. As a result, competition for market share in the industry in which we compete is significant.
Our entertainment golf business competes with restaurants, dining and social clubs and other entertainment attractions including movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and better capitalized, have a greater number of stores, have been in business longer and are better established with stronger name recognition in the markets where our Drive Shack and Puttery venues are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to our venues. In addition, the competition is subject to frequent innovations in the products and services offerings which could significantly impact our ability to attract and retain new and recurring guests.
Our traditional golf properties compete on a local and regional level with other country clubs and golf properties. The level of competition in the traditional golf business varies from region to region and is subject to change as existing facilities are renovated or new facilities are developed.
For more information about the competition we face generally and in our entertainment and traditional golf businesses specifically, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Competition in the industry in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Seasonality 
Seasonality can affect our results of operations. Our traditional golf business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as colder temperatures and shorter days reduce the demand for outdoor activities. As a result, the traditional golf business generates a disproportionate share of its annual revenue in the second and third quarters of each year. In addition, our Drive Shack and Puttery venues could be significantly impacted on a season-to-season basis, based on corporate event and social gathering volumes during holiday seasons and school vacation schedules. For this reason, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indicator of our current and/or future performance.
Government Regulation of Our Business
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from currently owned, formerly owned or operated facilities.
Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability on a property owner without regard to whether the property owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses by us or by previous owners of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our facilities are also subject to risks associated with mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing for our property. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental laws and regulations.
In addition, in order to build, improve, upgrade or expand some of our facilities, we may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Any improvement proposal may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.
We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations impact a number of aspects of operations, including golf course maintenance and food handling and preparation.
The ownership and operation of our facilities subjects us to federal, state and local laws regulating zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, and other real estate-related laws and regulations.
Our facilities and operations are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the ADA. The ADA generally requires that we remove architectural barriers when readily achievable so that our facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, included additional compliance requirements for golf facilities and recreational areas. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Federal legislation or regulations may further amend the ADA to impose more stringent requirements with which we would have to comply.
We are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. For instance, we must comply with provisions regulating equal employment, wage and hour practices and licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages.
Human Capital Management
Entertainment Golf
As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 837 employees in our entertainment golf segment including: 776 hourly venue employees, and 61 venue managers.
Traditional golf
As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 2,465 employees in our traditional golf segment: 2,206 hourly course employees, 259 course managers and 22 corporate personnel.
Corporate
As of December 31, 2021, there were 68 employees in our corporate segment. 
The number of Company employees represented by unions, and solely within the traditional golf business, is insignificant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good. While the Company has not adopted any systematic human capital metrics, management focuses on fostering diversity including gender diversity in the executive suite and the Company conducts training on respectful workplace practices for its employees on a regular basis. The Company also employs safety management resources internally in order to ensure safety in our traditional golf and entertainment golf venues.  The Company also offers financial benefits and rewards for performance in the discretion of individual departments in order to increase retention and reduce turnover.
Corporate Governance
We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors under the NYSE listing standards. The Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our directors, officers and employees.
