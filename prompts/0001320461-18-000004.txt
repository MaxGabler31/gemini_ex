Corporate History and Business Developments
Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was established in 2004 as a Delaware corporation and began operating on December 23, 2004 when it acquired the automotive segment of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (the “2004 Acquisition”). Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. operates the business primarily through its principal operating subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (“CSA U.S.”). Since the 2004 Acquisition, the Company has expanded and diversified its customer base through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
In August 2009, following the onset of the financial crisis and economic downturn that severely impacted the global automotive industry, Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and Canada commenced reorganization proceedings in the United States (the “Chapter 11 proceedings”) and Canada. In May 2010, the Company consummated its reorganization pursuant to a court-confirmed plan of reorganization and emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings and the Canadian proceedings.
From 2006 to 2013, the Company accelerated its growth through a number of strategic acquisitions including the Fluid Handling Systems Operations in North America, Europe and China (collectively, “FHS”) from ITT Industries, Inc.; Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems; a hose manufacturing operation in Mexico from the Gates Corporation; USi, Inc.; the sealing business of Sigit S.p.A.; a joint venture with Fonds de Modernisation des Equipementiers Automobiles (“FMEA”); and Jyco Sealing Technology.
We continued strategic acquisitions and partnerships in 2014 and 2015 with the acquisition of Cikautxo Borja, S.L.U. in Spain, a manufacturer of heating and cooling hoses; the purchase of an additional 47.5% of Huayu-Cooper Standard Sealing Systems Co. (“Shenya”), increasing our equity ownership to 95% and positioning the Company as a leader in sealing systems in the Chinese automotive market; the formation of a joint venture with Polyrub Extrusions (India) Private Limited to grow the Company’s fluid transfer systems business in Asia; and a joint venture with INOAC Corporation of Japan accelerating our fluid transfer systems strategy in Asia. In 2016, we acquired the North American fuel and brake business of AMI Industries to expand 
3

the Company’s fuel and brake business. We also gained control of our China-based joint venture, Shenya Sealing (Guangzhou) Company Limited. In 2017, the Company agreed to purchase the China fuel and brake business of AMI Industries, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2018.
In 2014 and 2015, the Company divested its thermal and emissions product line and hard coat plastic exterior trim business, respectively, to focus on the product lines where Cooper Standard holds leading market positions. 
Business Strategy
In 2013, we set a clear vision for achieving profitable growth with a mission to become a Top 30 automotive supplier in terms of sales and Top 5 in ROIC (return on invested capital). 
In 2016, the leadership team refined this vision: Driving Value Through Culture, Innovation and Results to more closely represent the evolution of the Company’s culture and to provide the basis for delivering even greater value. The global leadership team also reshaped the supporting pillars in 2016 to align with the progress of the Company. These pillars are:

Voice of the Customer: | We design and develop our products to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We listen intently and adjust to customer feedback to ensure we are consistently providing customer-focused products while meeting their evolving needs. Cooper Standard is dedicated to serving its global customers and the automotive industry as a whole.

As part of its world-class operations, Cooper Standard operates Global Councils focused on information technology, engineering, innovation, commercial and manufacturing initiatives. These councils allow Cooper Standard to better leverage the scale of the Company while also identifying best practices and transferring them around the world. 
Leverage Technology and Material Science for Innovative Solutions
We utilize our technical and material science expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of material science for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles.
Cooper Standard has evolved and further energized its approach to innovation with its i3 Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate). This approach is used as a mechanism to capture ideas from across our Company and supply partners while promoting a culture of innovation. Ideas are carefully evaluated by a global technology council and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle with a dedicated innovation team focused on breakthrough ideas. This team is developing game-changing technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which may drive future product direction. In fact, our culture of innovation enables Cooper Standard to innovate in areas of the vehicle that haven’t been touched in decades. These breakthrough innovations have resulted in over $450 million in booked sales in the last two years. With a continuous stream of new ideas flowing through our pipeline, we see our ability to bring breakthrough innovations to market as a clear and sustainable advantage and a value driver for our stakeholders.
Among recently announced technologies is Fortrex™, a revolutionary material that provides higher performance and lower weight to weather seals. Fortrex™ was named a 2018 PACE finalist with final judging expected to conclude in April of 2018. Several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction, have recently been realized. These include: MagAlloy™, a new processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance; and ArmorHose™, a breakthrough technology which results in significantly more durable coolant hoses and eliminates the need for separate abrasion sleeves on under-hood hose assemblies.
Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth
We intend to continue to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend and is encouraged by the OEM’s desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. Further, our operations currently include several successful joint ventures. 
Industry
The automotive industry is one of the world’s largest and most competitive. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. The business and industrial environment in each region also plays a role in vehicle demand as it relates to fleet vehicle sales and industrial use vehicles such as light and heavy trucks.
OEMs compete for market share in a variety of ways including pricing and incentives, the development of new, more attractive models, branding and advertising, and the ability to customize vehicle features and options to meet specific customer needs or demands. They rely heavily on thousands of specialized suppliers to provide the many distinct components and systems that comprise the modern vehicle. They also rely on these automotive suppliers to develop technological innovations that will help them meet consumer demands as well as regulatory requirements. 
The automotive supplier industry is generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. But it is also a highly competitive industry. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale globally, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and provide innovative, value-added technologies have been the most successful.
The technology of today’s vehicles is evolving rapidly. The evolution is being driven by many factors including consumer values and social behaviors, a competitive drive for differentiation, regulatory requirements and safety. Adapting new non-automotive technologies for automotive applications is also an important factor. Examples include but are not limited to wireless communications and connectivity, computers and data mining, artificial intelligence, autonomy and mobility, among others. While these types of technical innovations are garnering a lot of attention, and deservedly so, there are opportunities to add value through innovation in virtually all categories of automotive components and systems. Cooper Standard is continuing to focus on innovations for our customers that reduce weight, increase life-cycle and durability, reduce interior noise, enhance 
5

exterior appearance and simplify the manufacturing and assembly process. These are innovations that can be applicable and valuable to virtually any vehicle or vehicle manufacturer.
Markets Served
Our core business is focused on the passenger car and light truck market, up to and including Class 3 full-size, full-frame trucks, better known as the light vehicle market. This is our largest market and accounts for approximately 97% of our global sales. 
Adjacent Markets
In addition to the global light vehicle market, we also have dedicated sales and engineering teams in North America and Europe to leverage core product technology into near adjacent markets to profitably grow Cooper Standard through our Industrial and Specialty Group and in non-automotive markets. 
With a focus on industry segments such as commercial trucks, agricultural equipment and construction, we see an addressable market of over $2 billion and an opportunity to further diversify our revenue and profit base. Some of our traditional products, as well as our innovative technologies are very well suited to these markets. We believe these market segments represent near-term opportunities for high margin growth.
Further, we have implemented a strategy to leverage some of our material science in adjacent non-automotive markets through licensing agreements or the sale of material compounds. The initial focus of this business model is our Fortrex™ material technology. Fortrex™ is highly adaptable and we believe it has the potential to add significant value in many product categories and industries beyond the automotive industry. This adjacent market business is new. In 2017 we signed one license agreement with a partner in Japan. Sales under this agreement are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to make further investments in this business in 2018 to accelerate its roll-out and development. We also expect to conclude negotiations with a number of potential new licensee/partners in 2018.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
Joint ventures represent an important part of our business, both operationally and strategically. We have utilized joint ventures to enter into and expand in geographic markets such as China, India and Thailand, to acquire new customers and to develop new technologies. When entering new geographic markets, teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre-existing infrastructure. In addition, local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components.
The following table shows our significant unconsolidated joint ventures:

Country | Name | Ownership Percentage
India | Sujan Cooper Standard AVS Private Limited | 50% 
United States | Nishikawa Cooper LLC | 40% 
India | Polyrub Cooper Standard FTS Private Limited | 35% 
Thailand | Nishikawa Tachaplalert Cooper Ltd. | 20% 

Research and Development 
We have a dedicated team of technical and engineering resources in each region, some of which are located at our customers’ facilities. We utilize Design for Six Sigma and other methodologies that emphasize manufacturability and quality. Our development teams work closely with our customers to design and deliver innovative solutions. We continue to add technical resources throughout the world as required to support our customers, including new or updated facilities in Qingpu, China; Torreon, Mexico; and Livonia, Michigan in 2017. We spent $128.0 million, $117.8 million, and $108.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on engineering, research and development.
Intellectual Property
We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer needs and our game-changing ideas into innovation through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide.
Our patents are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and have an incentive program to recognize employees whose inventions are patented. Additionally, we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade 
8

secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process, but which nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including ArmorHose™, Ultra Pro Coat™, MagAlloy™ and Fortrex™, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership.
We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services.
Supplies and Raw Materials
Cooper Standard is committed to building strong relationships with our supply partners. We recognize the importance of engaging with suppliers to create value for our customers.
The principal raw materials for our business include synthetic and natural rubber, components manufactured from carbon steel, plastic resins and components, carbon black, process oils and components manufactured from aluminum. We manage the procurement of our raw materials to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable total cost. Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world. We often use offshore suppliers for machined components, die castings and other labor-intensive, economically freighted products in our North American and European facilities.
Raw material prices are subject to fluctuations and we have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage these fluctuations. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Global supply chain optimization includes using benchmarks and selective sourcing from strategic suppliers. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some customers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indices that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate.
Geographic Information
See Note 22. “Business Segments” to the consolidated financial statements for geographic information.
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Sales to OEMs are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers or during assembly plant shutdowns. Automotive production is traditionally reduced during July, August and year-end holidays and our quarterly results may reflect these trends. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry.
Backlog
Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 32,000 employees, including over 5,000 contingent workers. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees, and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We have renegotiated some of our domestic and non-domestic union agreements in 2017, and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. 
Community Involvement
Supported by the Cooper Standard Foundation, our employees are highly engaged in their local communities. The Foundation’s mission is to strengthen the communities in which Cooper Standard employees work and live through the passionate support of children’s charities, education, health and wellness, and community revitalization. The Cooper Standard Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with oversight by our Philanthropic Committee and Board of Trustees. For more

information on the Company’s community involvement, please visit our Corporate Responsibility Report located on the Cooper Standard website. 
Environmental
Cooper Standard considers itself a steward of the environment and we monitor the environmental impact of our business and products. We prioritize our environmental management as a means of driving and sustaining excellence. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws are not currently estimated to be material, such costs may be material in the future. Further details regarding our commitments and contingencies are provided in Note 21. “Contingent Liabilities.”
