GENERAL
 
Anvi Global Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. We formed the Company to commence operations in the business of selling crepes; however, we abandoned that business when control of the Company was sold by Tatiana Fumioka, on May 6, 2014. As a result, we are now controlled by Rama Mohan R. Busa, the principal shareholder and sole officer and director.
 
Anvi Global Holdings, Inc now intends to become a diversified, global holdings company with interest in a suite of businesses in various key segments, including mining, infrastructure, heavy earthworks, health services and aerospace engineering, positioned globally. The Company’s objective is to maximize shareholder value through investing in and/or acquiring a portfolio of companies in emerging global markets like India, South America and Africa, adding value to the operating enterprises. The Company plans to invest in or acquire businesses which offer strategic market position, strong cash flows and robust future potential growth, which are complementary to each other. The Company intends to broaden and intensify positions in carefully selected investment areas and is poised to have strong presence across these countries. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has not invested in or acquired any assets or company.
