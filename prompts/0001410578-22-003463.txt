Item 1. Business
Tingo, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiary, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Tingo” or the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, was formed on February 17, 2015. Our shares trade on the OTC Markets trading platform under the symbol ‘TMNA’. We acquired our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tingo Mobile, PLC, a Nigerian public limited company (“Tingo Mobile”), in a share exchange with its sole shareholder effective August 15, 2021. Prior to the acquisition of Tingo Mobile, the Company was headquartered in Thailand and its principal business consisted of technology consulting. This business was discontinued following the acquisition of Tingo Mobile, and we attributed a $3.2 million in net equity to the Company’s prior business as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity herein. Because our discontinued operations are immaterial to our overall business, we have not included them in our financial statements except as specifically noted herein.
The Company is an Agri-Fintech company offering a comprehensive platform service through use of smartphones – ‘device as a service’ (using GSM technology) to empower a marketplace to enable subscribers/farmers within and outside of the agricultural sector to manage their commercial activities of growing and selling their production to market participants both domestically and internationally. The ecosystem provides a ‘one stop shop’ solution to enable such subscribers to manage everything from airtime top ups, bill pay services for utilities and other service providers, access to insurance services and micro finance to support their value chain from ‘seed to sale’.
As of December 31, 2021, Tingo had approximately 9.3 million subscribers using its mobile phones and Nwassa payment platform (www.nwassa.com). Nwassa is Africa’s leading digital agriculture ecosystem that empowers rural farmers and agri-businesses by using proprietary technology to enable access to markets in which they operate. Farm produce can be shipped from farms across Africa to any part of the world, in both retail and wholesale quantities. Nwassa’s payment gateway also has an escrow structure that creates trust between buyers and sellers. Our system provides real-time pricing, straight from the farms, eliminating middlemen. Our users’ customers pay for produce bought using available pricing on our platform. Our platform is paperless, verified and matched against a smart contract. Data is efficiently stored on the blockchain. 
Our platform has created an escrow solution that secures the buyer, funds are not released to our members until fulfilment. The platform also facilitates trade financing, ensuring that banks and other lenders compete to provide credit to our members.
Although we have a large retail subscriber base, ours is essentially a business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) business model. Each of our subscribers is a member of one of two large farmers’ cooperatives with whom we have a contractual relationship and which relationship facilitates the distribution of our branded smartphones into various rural communities of member farmers. And it is through our phones and our proprietary applications imbedded therein where we are able to distribute our wider array of agri-fintech services and generate the diverse revenue streams as described in more detail in this report. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we also sold 2.9 million of our smartphones to a third cooperative, the members of which have the option to register for the Company’s Nwassa platform to gain access to our Agri-Fintech services and become additions to our subscriber base. 
Our principal office is located at 43 West 23rd Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10010, and the telephone number is +1-646-847-0144. Our corporate website is located at www.tingoinc.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our shares are traded on OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “TMNA”. 
Significant Developments
Impact of COVID-19 Generally. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious pathogen which causes COVID-19, coronavirus disease, or simply, the ‘coronavirus’, arose in Wuhan Province, China and spread to most of the world by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Throughout 2020, the spread of Covid-19 had a destabilizing effect on business and society globally, including labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, civil unrest, and unprecedented public borrowing to stimulate consumer economic activity. Although the global economy largely recovered from the slowdowns and interruptions of the first half of 2020, beginning in late 2020 and continuing throughout the remainder of 2021, new and more highly contagious strains of the virus appeared in different parts of the world, all of which were transmitted across the globe within a matter of weeks. The resurgence in infections and the introduction of these new strains, including the most recent Omicron strain in late 2021, have resulted in the return of certain travel restrictions and some proscriptions on social gatherings that were originally introduced in the early stages of the pandemic and had been relaxed in later 2020 or early 2021. Many of these reimposed restrictions have continued into the first quarter of 2022. As of March 15, 2022, the number of worldwide deaths attributable to the coronavirus stood at over 6.0 million.

The highly contagious nature of the coronavirus has caused numerous private and public organizations to substantially alter the way in which they operate. Many such organizations have, to the extent possible, required employees to work remotely to reduce opportunities for contagion. We are presently unable to predict either the potential near-term or longer-term impact that the coronavirus may have on our financial and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the crisis. Moreover, we are unable to predict the effect that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will have on our efforts to grow our business internationally. The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been and will likely continue to be impacted by future developments concerning the pandemic and the resulting economic disruption.
Impact of the Coronavirus on Africa. While morbidity and mortality rates in Africa resulting from Covid-19 have been substantially lower than in other world regions, the economic effects have nevertheless been severe. The pandemic initially caused a drop in global demand and prices for African natural resource exports (especially oil and some minerals), disrupted trade and tourism, stemmed remittances from African workers abroad, and promoted local lockdown measures. Some African economies began to rebound in 2021, but the region is recovering more slowly than others due, in part, to African governments’ limited stimulus resources. The effects of increased poverty, food insecurity, and school closures (often without virtual alternatives) are likely to endure. In late 2021, scientists in South Africa provided genomic identification and notification to international health authorities of the new ‘Omicron’ variant first detected in Botswana. Public fatigue with infection control measures, the Delta variant, and low vaccination rates helped drive earlier waves of cases in many African countries in 2021. Omicron’s rapid spread prompted countries around the world to restrict travel from southern Africa. As access to testing has been low in many countries, some health experts posit that actual caseloads and mortality may be higher than previously reported. Although we have managed to avoid a material disruption to our operations as a result of Covid-19, as of the date of filing of this Amended 10-K, we cannot predict the impact that the pathogen or its attendant economic effects will have on the Company in 2022 or beyond.
Competition
In Nigeria, we compete with a large number of mobile phone carriers. Current competitors may seek to intensify their investments in those markets and also expand their businesses in new markets. Competitive pressure from current or future competitors or our failure to quickly and effectively adapt to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our growth. Current or future competitors may offer lower prices and enhanced features, and we may be forced to lower our prices and upgrade our phones and network in order to maintain our market share.
With respect to our payment services, we face competition from financial institutions with payment processing offerings, debit and credit card service providers, other offline payment options and other electronic payment system operators, in each of the markets in which we operate. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors may introduce new services or enhance existing services. New entrants tied to established brands may engender greater user confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services.
We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of the Tingo network and is an important element in attracting new users. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and our ability to ensure that the Tingo network remains reliable, and useful at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new organizations to us or to grow or maintain our telecommunications network.
If we fail to compete effectively, we may lose existing users and fail to attract new users, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
Transfer and Disbursing Agent
We employ Action Stock Transfer as our transfer agent to record transfers of our shares, maintain proxy records and to process distributions. The principal business office of our transfer agent is 2469 East, Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214, Salt Lake City, UT 84121.
Certifications
Commencing with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provided certifications as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,

and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and were attached as exhibits to that report. These certifications have also been filed as exhibits to this Amended 10-K.
