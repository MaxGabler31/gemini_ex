Item 1. Business.
History and Overview
 
We are a pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement company focusing on the research and development of proprietary drugs including our anti-cancer compound Adva-27a, and anti-coronavirus lead compound, SBFM-PL4.
 
We also, through our wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), develop science-based nutritional supplements, and currently sell one nutritional supplement product.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name “Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.” Until October 2009, our business was to provide management consulting services to small and home-office based companies.
 
Effective October 15, 2009, we acquired Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. in a transaction classified as a reverse acquisition. Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. was holding an exclusive license to a new anticancer drug bearing the laboratory name, Adva-27a (the “License Agreement”). Upon completion of the reverse acquisition transaction, we changed our name to Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. and began operating as a pharmaceutical company focusing on the development of the licensed Adva-27a anticancer drug.
 
In October 2012, we published the results of initial preclinical studies of Adva-27a in the peer-reviewed journal, ANTICANCER RESEARCH. The studies were conducted in collaboration with Binghamton University, a State University of New York, and Ecole Polytechnique, Universite de Montreal. The publication is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432 (2012)].
 
In July 2014, we formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”) for the purposes of offering generic pharmaceutical products in Canada and elsewhere around the world. In the first quarter of 2021, Sunshine Canada transitioned its focus to the development and marketing of Science-Based Nutritional Supplements.
 
In December 2015, we acquired all worldwide issued (US Patent Number 8,236,935, and 10,272,065) and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 for the Adva-27a anticancer compound from Advanomics Corporation (now known as TRT Pharma Inc.), a related party, and terminated the License Agreement. We are continuing development of the Adva-27a anticancer drug covered by these patents.
 
In December 2018, the Company launched its first Science-Based Nutritional Supplements product, Essential 9™, an over-the-counter tablet comprised of the nine (9) essential amino acids that the human body cannot make. Essential 9™ has been authorized for marketing by Health Canada under NPN 80089663.
 
Effective April 6, 2020, we completed another 20 to 1 reverse split of our Common Stock, reducing the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock from 1,193,501,925 to 59,675,417 (the “Second Reverse Stock Split”). The number of Common Shares authorized for issuance remained as previously established at 3,000,000,000 shares.
 
On May 22, 2020, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections. Our patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease, Mpro, an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020. On April 30, 2021, we filed a PCT application containing new research results and extending coverage to include the Coronavirus Papain-Like protease, PLpro. The priority date of May 22, 2020 has been maintained in the newly filed PCT application.

Effective October 6, 2020, we entered into a Research Agreement with the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. (“UGARF”), representing the University of Georgia (“UGA”). The purpose of the agreement is to memorialize the terms of our working together with UGA to conduct the necessary research and development to advance the Company’s Anti-Coronavirus lead compound, SBFM-PL4 (or derivatives thereof) through various stages of preclinical development. The agreement grants us an exclusive worldwide license for all of the intellectual property developed during the term of the agreement, whether developed by UGA alone or jointly with us.
 
On January 26, 2021, we received a Notice of Allowances from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for a new patent application covering Adva-27a. The newly issued patent contains new subject matter and extends the proprietary protection of Adva-27a in Canada until 2034.
 
On February 4, 2021, we entered into an additional research agreement and an exclusive license agreement with the University of Georgia (“UGA”) for two Anti-Coronavirus compounds which UGA had previously developed and patented. This second research agreement provides for UGA to conduct mice studies on the two UGA compounds licensed to us. In December 2021, we were informed by the University of Georgia that preliminary results of the mice study taking place indicated these two compounds have no significant effect on mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we no longer plan to pursue the UGA License or further development of these two compounds.
 
On March 9, 2021, we received a Notice of Allowance from the European Patent Office for a new patent application covering Adva-27a. The newly issued patent contains new subject matter and extends the proprietary protection of Adva-27a in Europe until 2034. The equivalent patent in the United States was issued in 2019 (US Patent Number 10,272,065).
 
On October 1, 2021, we filed a patent application for a potential new treatment for neurodegenerative disorders. The patent application contains experimental results showing that certain mRNA molecules provide protective effects against oxidative stress in differentiated neuronal cells, a process that mimics neuronal degeneration. This new patent application has a priority date of October 1, 2021.
 
 On February 18, 2022 we entered into a research agreement with the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona (the “University of Arizona”). Pursuant to the research agreement, the University of Arizona agreed to use reasonable efforts to perform a research project focused on determining the in vivo safety, pharmacokinetics, and dose selection properties of three University of Arizona owned PLpro inhibitors, followed by efficacy testing in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, in consideration for certain milestone payments to be made by the Company. Under the agreement, the University of Arizona granted the Company a first option to negotiate for a commercial, royalty-bearing license for all intellectual property invented or authored by University of Arizona personnel under the research project.

SBFM-PL4 Anti-Coronavirus Treatment
 
Viruses carry minimal genetic information as they rely, for the most part, on host cellular machinery to multiply. Coronavirus has a positive-sense RNA genome consisting of approximately 30,000 nucleotides, a genome size that places it among the larger sized viruses. A positive-sense RNA genome is effectively a messenger RNA which allows the virus to express its genes immediately upon gaining entry into the host cell without the need for any prior replication or transcription steps as is the case with negative-sense RNA or DNA viruses. This is part of what makes Coronavirus a highly aggressive pathogen. Many of the causative agents of serious human diseases are positive-sense RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C, Zeka, Polio, West Nile, Dengue, Cardiovirus, and many others. Some positive-sense RNA viruses, such as the rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, are less clinically serious but they are responsible for widespread morbidity on a yearly basis.

The initial genome expression products of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid-19, are two large polyproteins, referred to as pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins are cleaved at 15 specific sites by two virus encoded proteases (Mpro and PLpro) to generate 16 different non-structural proteins essential for viral replication. Mpro and PLpro represent attractive anti-viral drug development targets as they play a central role in the early stages of viral replication. The crystal structure of Mpro shows the presence of an active site Cysteine (Cys145) and a coordinated active site Histidine (His41), both of which are essential for the enzyme’s proteolytic activity. Similarly, PLpro, also a Cysteine Protease, has an active site Cysteine at position 112 and a Histidine at 273. The following is a summary of the development to date of our Coronavirus Treatment project:
 

· | On May 22, 2020, we filed a patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections. Our patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the Coronavirus main protease (Mpro), an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The small molecules covered by the patent application were designed by Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our chief executive officer. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In August 2020, we completed the synthesis of four different potential inhibitors of Coronavirus protease. These compounds are based on the technology described in our patent application filed on May 22, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In September 2020, we completed the screening of our four compounds and subsequently identified a lead Anti-Coronavirus drug candidate (SBFM-PL4). The screening which pinpointed the lead compound was performed at the University of Georgia, College of Pharmacy under the leadership of Dr. Scott D. Pegan, Director of the Center for Drug Discovery and Interim Associate Head of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In October 2020, we expanded our collaboration with Dr. Scott Pegan’s group by entering into a research agreement with the University of Georgia to further develop our Anti-Coronavirus lead compound, SBFM-PL4. We will proceed by conducting the in vitro studies followed by cell culture assays and assessment in Coronavirus infected mice before entering human clinical trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | On February 18, 2022, we expanded our effort to identify new PLpro inhibitors by entering into a research agreement with the University of Arizona. Pursuant to the research agreement, the University of Arizona agreed to perform a research project focused on determining the in vivo safety, pharmacokinetics, and dose selection properties of three University of Arizona owned PLpro inhibitors, followed by efficacy testing in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Under the agreement, the University of Arizona granted us a first option to negotiate for a commercial, royalty-bearing license for all intellectual property invented or authored by University of Arizona personnel under the research project.

Adva-27a Anticancer Drug
 
Since inception, our proprietary drug development activities have focused on the development of a small molecule called Adva-27a for the treatment of aggressive forms of cancer. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a has been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of all issued and pending worldwide patents pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patents Number 8,236,935 and 10,272,065.

Figure 1
 
Adva-27a is a GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of Podophyllotoxin (see Figure 1). Another derivative of Podophyllotoxin called Etoposide is currently on the market and is used to treat various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, testicular cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and several other forms of cancer. Etoposide is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. Adva-27a and Etoposide are similar in that they both attack the same target in cancer cells, namely the DNA unwinding enzyme, Topoisomerase II. Unlike Etoposide however, Adva-27a is able to penetrate and destroy Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells. Adva-27a is the only compound known today that is capable of destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer. In addition, Adva-27a has been shown to have distinct and more desirable biological and pharmacological properties compared to Etoposide. In side-by-side studies using Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer cells and Etoposide as a reference, Adva-27a showed markedly greater cell killing activity (see Figure 2).
Figure 2

Our preclinical studies to date have shown that:
 

· | Adva-27a is effective at killing different types of Multidrug Resistant cancer cells, including Pancreatic Cancer Cells (Panc-1), Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7/MDR), Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H69AR), and Uterine Sarcoma Cells (MES-SA/Dx5).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies and pharmacokinetics data in rats.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase II with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar (this number has recently been reduced to 1.44 micromolar as a result of resolving the two isomeric forms of Adva-27a).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adva-27a does not inhibit tubulin assembly.
--+--------------------------------------------

 
These and other preclinical data have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, a peer-reviewed International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment. The publication which is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32: 4423-4432 (2012)] is available on our website at www.sunshinebiopharma.com. Information on our website is not part of this report.
 
We have been delayed in our clinical development program due to lack of funding. Our fund raising efforts are continuing and as soon as adequate financing is in place we will continue our clinical development program of Adva-27a by conducting the following next sequence of steps:
 

· | GMP Manufacturing of 2 kilogram for use in IND-Enabling Studies and Phase I Clinical Trials
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IND-Enabling Studies
--+---------------------


· | Regulatory Filing (Fast-Track Status Anticipated)
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Phase I Clinical Trials (Pancreatic Cancer Indication)
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 
Adva-27a’s initial indication will be pancreatic cancer for which there are currently little or no treatment options available. We are planning to conduct our clinical trials at McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada. All aspects of the clinical trials in Canada will employ FDA standards at all levels.

According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. While particularly effective against Multidrug Resistant Cancer, we believe Adva-27a can potentially treat all cancer types, particularly those in which Topoisomerase II has been amplified. We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to purchase or license our drug. However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us. In the event we do not consummate such a transaction, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drug on our own. The following, Figure 3, is a space-filling molecular model of our Adva-27a.

Nutritional Supplements Operations
 
Sunshine Canada has recently terminated its generic pharmaceuticals operations and shifted its focus to the development and marketing of science-based nutritional supplements. In December 2018, we completed the development of Essential 9™. On December 14, 2018, Health Canada issued NPN 80089663 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the Essential 9™ product. Our Essential 9™ nutritional supplement tablets contain a balanced formula of the 9 Essential Amino Acids that the human body cannot make. Essential Amino Acids are 9 out of the 20 amino acids required for protein synthesis. Proteins are involved in all body functions – From the musculature and immune system to hormones and neurotransmitters. Like vitamins, Essential Amino Acids cannot be made by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Deficiency in one or more of the 9 Essential Amino Acids can lead to loss of muscle mass, fatigue, weight gain and reduced ability to build muscle mass in athletes. Our Essential 9™ provides all 9 Essential Amino Acids in freeform and in the proportions recommended by Health Canada. Essential 9™ is currently available on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca. Figure 4 below shows our 60-Tablet Essential 9™ product.

In November 2019, we received Health Canada approval for another nutritional supplement, a new Calcium-Vitamin D tablets. Health Canada issued NPN 80093432 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™.
 
Vitamin D is a group of steroid-like molecules responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. They are also involved in multiple other biological functions, including proper functioning of the immune system, promoting healthy growth of bone, and reduction of inflammation. The most important compounds in this group are Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Sunshine Biopharma’s Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™ tablets contain both of these compounds as well as calcium for optimum health benefits. We are considering potentially launching this product in 2022.
 
We are also developing additional nutritional supplement products. We may launch additional nutritional supplement products within approximately 1-2 years.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our Essential 9™ nutritional supplement is manufactured under contract by Inov Pharma Inc., an independent third party based in Montreal (Canada). Inov Pharma Inc. operates a GMP certified manufacturing facility and all of our nutritional supplements products are manufactured under such conditions.
 
We currently do not have any pharmaceutical products on the market. Research quantities of our drug candidates are currently manufactured at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA (Anti-Coronavirus compounds) and WuXi App Tech (Adva-27a compound) in China.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Our Essential 9™ nutritional supplement is currently sold through Amazon only. Company personnel and outside consultants develop and place ads on Google, YouTube and Amazon, and the same team manages the Company’s account with Amazon.
 
While particularly effective against Multidrug Resistant Cancer, we believe Adva-27a can potentially treat all cancer types, particularly those in which Topoisomerase II has been amplified. Similarly, we believe there is potentially a large market for our Anti-Coronavirus treatment currently under development at the University of Georgia. We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials, we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to purchase or license these drugs. However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us. If we do not consummate such a transaction, and we receive required regulatory approvals, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drugs on our own.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We are the exclusive owner of all worldwide rights pertaining to Adva-27a covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029. The patent applications filed under PCT/FR2007/000697 have been issued in the United States (US Patent Number 8,236,935), Europe, and Canada. The patent applications filed under PCT/CA2014/000029 have recently been issued in the United States (US Patent Number 10,272,065), and allowed in Europe, and Canada.
 
In 2018 we completed the development of Essential 9™, our first nutritional supplement. On December 14, 2018, Health Canada issued NPN 80089663 through which it authorized Sunshine Biopharma Inc. to manufacture and sell the Essential 9™ product. We are currently preparing the necessary documents for registration of our Essential 9™ trademark in the United States.
 
In November 2019, we received Health Canada approval for another nutritional supplement, a new Calcium-Vitamin D tablets. Health Canada issued NPN 80093432 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™.

On May 22, 2020, the Company filed a provisional patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections. The Company’s patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease, Mpro, an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020. On April 30, 2021, the Company filed a PCT application containing new research results and extending coverage to include the Coronavirus Papain-Like protease, PLpro. The priority date of May 22, 2020 has been maintained in the newly filed PCT application.
 
On October 1, 2021, we filed a patent application for a potential new treatment for neurodegenerative disorders. The patent application contains experimental results showing that certain mRNA molecules provide protective effects against oxidative stress in differentiated neuronal cells, a process that mimics neuronal degeneration. This new patent application has a priority date of October 1, 2021.
 
Government Regulations
 
All of our business operations, including our proprietary drug development operations, and nutritional supplements operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.
 
In the United States, the Federal Government agency responsible for regulating drugs and nutritional supplements is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Canadian counterpart to the FDA is Health Canada. Though the FDA and Health Canada have generally similar requirements for drugs and nutritional supplements to be approved or allowed to be marketed, approval in one jurisdiction does not automatically result in approval in the other. In Canada, drugs and nutritional supplements are authorized through the issuance by Health Canada of a Drug Identification Number (DIN) for pharmaceutical products and a Natural Product Number (NPN) for nutritional supplements. In the United States, the marketing of nutritional supplements does not require prior approval from the FDA. In both the U.S. and Canada, the ingredients, manufacturing processes and facilities for all drugs and supplements must meet the guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). Moreover, all drug manufacturers must perform a series of tests, both during and after production, to show that every drug or supplement batch made meets the regulatory requirements for that product.
 
In connection with nutritional supplements, the FDA regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of such products, while the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet certain GMP requirements to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and the FTC and we believe we are currently operating within both the FDA and FTC mandates.
 
In the area of drug development where our Anti-Coronavirus and Anti-Cancer compounds fall, we will be subject to significant regulations in the U.S. in order to obtain approval of the FDA to offer our products for sale. The approximate procedure for obtaining FDA approval involves an initial filing of an IND application following which the FDA would review and allow for the drug developer to proceed with Phase I clinical trials. Following completion of Phase I, the results are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase II. Similarly, following completion of Phase II the data are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase III. Following completion of Phase III, a new drug application, or NDA is submitted and a request is made for marketing approval. Depending on various issues and considerations, the FDA could provide “emergency use authorization” or limited approval for “compassionate-use” if the drug treats terminally ill patients with limited other treatment options available. As of the date of the filing of this report, we have not made any filings with the FDA or other regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. We anticipate filing an initial IND application for an anti-Covid-19 compound within approximately one year and filing an initial IND for our anti-cancer compound within approximately two years. We have however had discussions with clinicians and as a result we believe that the FDA and Health Canada are likely to grant us a so-called “fast-track” process on the basis of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the terminal nature of the cancer type we are planning to treat. There are no assurances this will occur.
 
Employees 
 
As of the date of this report, we have three employees, comprised of our management team. Presently, most of our development and marketing activities are subcontracted out to specialized service providers. As our business activities expand, we anticipate that we will need additional employees in the areas of accounting, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales and laboratory personnel.

Competition 
 
Our Anti-Coronavirus drug development project is in direct competition with over 34 companies in the U.S. and abroad that are developing or that have developed vaccine or treatment options for Covid-19. Among the companies that have or are developing vaccines are Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson. The companies focused on treatments include Pfizer, Merck, Gilead, Eli Lilly, and Regeneron. To date, three vaccines (Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and Johnson & Johnson’s) and two (2) antibody treatments (Regeneron’s, and Eli Lilly’s) have been approved by the FDA for emergency use, and Pfizer’s vaccine has received full FDA approval. Gilead’s Remdesivir, an antiviral injectable, was approved by the FDA for treatment of Covid-19 in October 2020. In addition, in December 2021, Pfizer received Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”), for its antiviral pill, Paxlovid, and, in the same month, the FDA granted Merck EUA for its antiviral pill, Molnupiravir. While the approved vaccines, pills and injectable treatments are effective, we believe that additional treatment options such as the one we are developing could potentially form an important component of the range of anti-coronavirus tools available to attending physicians.
 
In the area of anticancer drug development, we compete with large publicly and privately held companies engaged in developing new cancer therapies. There are numerous other entities engaged in oncology therapeutics development that have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.  Nearly all major pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Amgen, Roche, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, to name a few, have on-going anticancer drug development programs and some of the drugs they may develop could be in direct competition with our own. In addition, a number of smaller companies are working in the area of cancer therapy and could develop drugs that may be in competition with ours.
 
Similarly, our Essential 9™ and Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™ fall directly within a very crowded and highly competitive product sector. As of the date of the filing of this report, we believe Essential 9™ is the only Essential Amino Acid product that comprises all 9 essential amino acids in tablet form. We believe this may provide us with a competitive advantage, at least for the near future but there are no assurances that this will occur.
