ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background
 
WOD Retail Solutions, Inc. formerly Elite Data Services, Inc., (“WODI”) (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Florida on November 23, 1981 as Mammathetics Corp. On November 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the proposal to change the name of the company from Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation to Elite Data Services, Inc In September 2018 its name was changed to WOD Retail Solutions, Inc.. 
 
From 1981 through the first quarter of 2011, the Company’s business was that of a marketer of tumor detection equipment. On March 9, 2011, the Company shifted its focus to the recoverable energy sector. In 2013, the Company transitioned its operations to offering web-based marketing services for the automotive industry through owned and operated online platforms. Further, in 2014, the Company acquired licensing and distribution rights to operate gaming machines in Honduras and Roatan. Both the online marketing and gaming operations continued from 2014 through December 31, 2016. 
 
On May 18, 2016, we restructured the Company resulting in the online marketing assets and operations being transferred into a newly formed entity, Elite Data Marketing LLC, a Florida corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On same date, we also created Elite Gaming Ventures LLC, a Florida limited liability company, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to own and operate Elite Data Holdings S.A., a Honduras corporation, which was designated to handle all the gaming operations under a newly formed joint venture.
 
On August 26, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of WOD Market LLC (“WOD”), a Colorado limited liability company and provider of intelligent retail solutions for gym owners and coaches, in three (3) separate closings with the final closing anticipated on October 15, 2016. 
 
For the period ending December 31, 2016, we were a technology driven management company which owned and operated online marketing and gaming businesses. In addition, we continued to pursue the acquisition of WOD, which did not close as anticipated on October 15, 2016.
 
Subsequently, on January 10, 2017, the Company executed the first amendment to the purchase of WOD to extend the second closing date from on or about September 15, 2016 to on or about March 31, 2017, and further extend the third and final closing date from on or about October 15, 2016 to on or about June 30, 2017, respectively.
 
Concurrently, on March 14, 2017, Company executed the second amendment to the definitive agreement, as amended, which further amended certain terms of the WOD purchase, including the formation of a joint venture to further develop and manage the current WOD business.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company executed a note cancellation agreement and assignment with Baker & Myers & Associates LLC (“Baker Myers”) which resulted in Elite Data Marketing LLC no longer being a subsidiary of the Company, with no further operational effect or obligation to the Company.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company executed a joint venture termination agreement with H Y H Investments S.A. (“HYHI”) which resulted in Elite Gaming Ventures LLC (and, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Data Holdings S.A.) no longer being a subsidiary of the Company. 
 
Today, the Company, serves the fitness community marketing training products in fitness centers and gyms through automated retail solutions allowing coaches and trainers to focus on what’s important while athletes have access to the products they need to perform at their highest level.

WOD intends to forge a mutually beneficial relationship with each gym, customer and vendor to ensure the best possible experience.
