 Item 1. Business.
 OVERVIEW  The following organization chart sets forth our wholly-owned subsidiaries:
 
General
 SusGlobal Energy Corp. (SusGlobal) was formed by articles of amalgamation on December 3, 2014, in the Province of Ontario, Canada and its executive office is in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at 200 Davenport Road. Our telephone number is 416-223-8500. Our website address is www.susglobalenergy.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). SusGlobal Energy Corp., a company in the start-up stages and Commandcredit Corp. (Commandcredit), an inactive Canadian public company, amalgamated to continue business under the name of SusGlobal Energy Corp. There is currently no public or other market for the shares of our common stock. 
 On May 23, 2017, SusGlobal Energy Corp. filed an application for authorization to continue in another Jurisdiction with the Ministry of Government Services in Ontario and a certificate of corporate domestication and certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware under which it changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Ontario to the State of Delaware (the Domestication). In connection with the Domestication, each of the currently issued and outstanding common shares were automatically converted on a one-for-one basis into common shares compliant with the laws of the state of Delaware (the Shares). As a result of the Domestication, pursuant to Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL), SusGlobal Energy Corp. continued its existence under the DGCL as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware. The business, assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as well as its principal location and fiscal year, were the same immediately after the Domestication as they were immediately prior to the Domestication. SusGlobal Energy Corp. filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register the Shares and this registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on May, 23, 2017. 
 When the terms the Company, we, us or our are used in this document, those terms refer to SusGlobal Energy Corp., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SusGlobal Energy Canada Corp., SusGlobal Energy Canada I Ltd. and SusGlobal Energy Belleville Ltd.
 SusGlobal is a renewable energy company focused on acquiring, developing and monetizing a global portfolio of proprietary technologies in the waste to energy application.
 With the growing amount of organic wastes being produced by society as a whole, a solution for sustainable global management of these wastes must be achieved. SusGlobal through its proprietary technology and processes is equipped and confident to deliver this objective.
 Management believes renewable energy is the energy of the future. Sources of this type of energy are more evenly distributed over the earths surface than finite energy sources, making it an attractive alternative to petroleum-based energy. Biomass, one of the renewable resources, is derived from organic material such as forestry, food, plant and animal residuals. SusGlobal can therefore help you turn what many consider waste into precious energy. The portfolio will be comprised of four distinct types of technologies: (a) Process Source Separated Organics (SSO) in anaerobic digesters to divert from landfills and recover biogas. This biogas can be converted to gaseous fuel for industrial processes, electricity to the grid or cleaned for compressed renewable gas. (b) Increasing the capacity of existing infrastructure (anaerobic digesters) to allow processing of SSO to increase biogas yield. (c) Utilize recycled plastics to produce liquid fuels and (d) process digestate to produce a pathogen free organic fertilizer. 
 The convertibility of organic material into valuable end products such as biogas, liquid biofuels, organic fertilizers and compost shows the utility of renewable energy. These products can be converted into electricity, fuels and marketed to agricultural operations that are looking for an increase in crop yields, soil amendment and environmentally-sound practices. This practice also diverts these materials from landfills and reduces greenhouse gas emissions that result from landfilling organic wastes. The Company can provide peace of mind that the full lifecycle of organic material is achieved, global benefits are realized and stewardship for total sustainability is upheld.
 The project and services offered can benefit the public and private markets. The following includes some of our work managing organic waste streams: Anaerobic Digestion, Dry Digestion, Biogas Production, Wastewater Treatment, In- Vessel Composting, SSO Treatment, Biosolids Heat Treatment and Composting.
 The Company can provide a full range of services for handling organic residuals in a period where innovation and sustainability are paramount. From start to finish we offer in-depth knowledge, a wealth of experience and cutting-edge technology for handling organic waste. 
 3

The primary focus of the services SusGlobal provides includes identifying idle or underutilized anaerobic digesters and integrating our technologies with capital investment to optimizing the operation of the existing digesters to reach their full capacity for processing SSO. Our processes not only divert significant organic waste from landfills, but also result in methane avoidance, with significant Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reductions from waste disposal. The processes also produce renewable energy through the conversion of wastewater biosolids and organic wastes in the same equipment (co-digestion) and valuable end products such as biogas, electricity and organic fertilizer, considered Class AA organic fertilizer.
 Currently, the primary customers are municipalities in both rural and urban centers throughout southern and central Ontario, Canada. Much of the research and development that has been carried out has been completed by our CEO through multiple projects carried out on projects prior to the formation of SusGlobal. Where necessary, to be in compliance with provincial and local environmental laws and regulations, SusGlobal submits applications to the respective authorities for approval prior to any necessary engineering being carried out. 
 Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company

 On May 14, 2015, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change announced formal targets to be met to satisfy a commitment necessary to join the WCI along with Quebec and California, who are in the WCI with Cap and Trade commitments since 2014. The Ontario targets are very ambitious, with greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission reductions of 15% by 2020, 37% by 2030 and 80% by 2050, all from a 1990 baseline. Ontario achieved a 6% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels in 2014, mainly by closing all coal-fired power plants. The targets announced will require a focused program to reduce GHG emissions. The Company’s activities all contribute to GHG reductions, so will be a key part of Ontario’s initiative. The Company has also contacted counterparties in Quebec and California to explore opportunities for relevant projects. SusGlobal is committed to making all its commercial activities carbon neutral. The new Cap and Trade regulations are effective January 2017. 
  On May 6, 2015, the Company finalized an agreement with Syngas, a company incorporated under the laws of Malaysia, providing an exclusive license for the Company to use Syngas Intellectual Property within North America for a period of five years from the date of this agreement, for $1 consideration, renewable every five years upon written request. Syngas produces equipment that uses an innovative process to produce liquid transportation fuel from plastic waste material. The Company issued 20,000 common shares of the Company to an introducing party, determined to be valued at $2,000. The technology license is being amortized on a straight-line basis, over a period of 10 years. There are no other obligations under this agreement.
  The Company and Syngas intend to collaborate and cooperate with a view to achieving economic and financial success for their respective businesses. The Company will continue to pursue other similar intellectual property around the world as we combine this and other technologies in innovative configurations to monetize the portfolio of proprietary technologies and processes to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.
  Operations 
 Waste Transfer Station: As of December 31, 2017, we own the Environmental Compliance Approvals (the “ECAs”) issued by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the “MOECC”), from the Province of Ontario, in place to operate a waste transfer station with the capacity to process up to 50,000 metric tonnes of waste annually. The Company is reviewing plans to construct and equip the waste transfer station. The location of the waste transfer station, once built, will be alongside our organic composting facility, noted below, near Belleville, Ontario, Canada. 
  Access to the waste transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities where such disposal continues to be permitted. Tipping fees charged to third parties at waste transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors.
  Organic Composting Facility. Our organic composting facility, located near Belleville, Ontario Canada, has ECAs in place to accept up to 70,000 metric tonnes of waste annually and is currently in operation. Certain assets of the organic composting facility, including the ECAs for the waste transfer station, were acquired by the Company on September 15, 2017, from the court appointed receiver, BDO Canada Limited, for Astoria, under an APA. The Company charges tipping fees for the waste accepted at the organic composting facility based on arrangements in place with the customers and the type of waste accepted. Typical waste accepted includes, leaf and yard, biosolids, food, liquid and paper sludge. During 2017, tipping fees ranged from $21 ($26 CAD) to $70 ($88 CAD) per metric tonne. 
  Compost Sales. The Company also sells organic compost to local customers. During 2017, the average selling price of the compost per metric tonne was approximately $11 ($14 CAD). 
  Competition
  Seasonal Trends
  Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to waste volumes resulting from higher construction and demolition waste volumes and the availability of leaf and yard waste along with contracts involving the grinding of leaf and yard waste. In addition, revenue from the sale of organic compost would be higher beginning in late spring and tapering off in the fall. This will be more evident when our organic composting facility will have been in operation for a full fiscal year. 
Employees
  As of December 31, 2017, we had six full-time employees and four independent contractors. Of the six full time employees, one was employed in a management and administrative position, and the balance in operations. The four independent contractors provide services in management positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations
 Financial Assurance
 Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or waste transfer station operating permits and (ii) estimated post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at our operations. We have established financial assurance using letters of credit and deposits with the municipalities. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.
 A letter of credit is supported by our credit facility with PACE. 
 Insurance
 We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation, real and personal property, directors and officers liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Regulation
 Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the MOECC), Environment Canada, and various other federal, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.
 Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid and liquid waste in an environmentally sound manner, our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. With acquisition, development or expansion of a waste management or waste transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.
 The primary Provincial statutes affecting our business are summarized below:
 Provincial and Local Regulations 
 There are also various provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. The Province of Ontario (Ontario) has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. Ontario has also adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of waste transfer stations. Some regions, municipalities and other local governments in Ontario have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements.
 Our operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Many regional and local governments in Ontario mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste and electronics at landfills. The number of regional and local governments in Ontario with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging. In addition, Ontario has imposed timelines for the ban of organics from landfills in the province in an effort to totally divert these wastes from landfills. This will provide opportunities for the expansion of facilities like ours. This trend has been already occurred in the United States of America (the USA), where various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted flow control regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The United States Congress adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.

Federal, Provincial and Local Climate Change Initiatives
 In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of biogas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and provincial level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity. Despite the announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords, we have seen no reduction in customer demand for services aligned with their GHG reduction goals and strategies. Ontario is part of the western climate initiative (the WCI) led by the state of California and, if anything, California has doubled down on their GHG reduction goals. The states of Oregon and Washington are also considering joining the WCI that currently has California, Ontario and Quebec as members. 
 We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events.
