We also operated a leading business communications company (the “Media Group”) serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry. We have two principal reportable segments: Nightclubs and Bombshells.

OUR BUSINESS 
 
We operate several businesses, which we aggregate for financial reporting into two reportable segments – Nightclubs and Bombshells – and combine other operating segments into “Other.”
 
Nightclubs
 
We operate our nightclubs through the following brands that target many different demographics of customers by providing a unique, quality entertainment environment. Our adult entertainment clubs do business as Rick’s Cabaret, Jaguar’s Club, Tootsie’s Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Club Onyx, Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, Scarlett’s Cabaret, Temptations Adult Cabaret, Foxy’s Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, The Seville, and Silver City Cabaret. We also operate dance clubs under the brand name Studio 80.
 
We generate revenue on our nightclubs through the sale of alcoholic beverages, food and merchandise items; service in the form of cover charge, dance fees, and room rentals; and through other related means such as ATM commissions and vending income, among others.
 
During fiscal 2017, Nightclub segment sales mix was 47% service revenue; 39% alcoholic beverages; and 14% food, merchandise and other, which had a combined segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold) of approximately 87%.

We acquired Hollywood Showclub and other properties in the Greater St. Louis area in April 2017 for a total purchase price of $4.2 million. In May 2017, we acquired Scarlett’s Cabaret Miami for a total purchase price of approximately $26.0 million. In July 2017, we relaunched Hollywood Showclub as Scarlett’s Cabaret St. Louis, and in August 2017, we opened Hollywood Hunt Club, a 51% joint venture, located on one of the other Greater St. Louis properties we acquired.
 
A list of our nightclub locations is in Item 2— “Properties.”
 
Bombshells
 
As of September 30, 2017, our five Bombshells were located in Texas with one in Dallas, one in Austin and three in the Houston area. In 2015, our subsidiary, BMB Franchising Services, Inc. (“BMB Franchising”), announced that it was beginning a nationwide franchising program for Bombshells. As of March 2016, BMB Franchising has received approval to sell franchises in all 50 states. The restaurant sets itself apart with décor that pays homage to all branches of the U.S. military. Locations feature local DJs, large outdoor patios, and more than 75 state-of-the-art flat screen TVs for watching your favorite sports. All food and drink menu items have military names. Bombshell Girls, with their military-inspired uniforms, are a key attraction. Their mission, in addition to waitressing, is to interact with guests and generate a fun atmosphere.
 
We opened the first Bombshells in March 2013 in Dallas, quickly becoming one of the most popular restaurant destinations in the area. Within a year, four more opened in the Austin and Houston, Texas areas. Of the five, three are freestanding pad sites and two are inline locations. In September 2016, we closed one Bombshells location in Webster, Texas. In July 2017, we opened another Bombshells location in Houston.
 
During fiscal 2017, sales mix was 63% alcoholic beverages and 37% food, merchandise and other, which had a combined segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold) of 75%.
 
For a list of our Bombshells locations, refer to Item 2—“Properties.”
 
Media Group
 
The Media Group, made up of wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the leading business communications company serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. It owns a national industry convention and tradeshow; two national industry trade publications; two national industry award shows; and more than a dozen industry and social media websites.

OUR STRATEGY
 
Our overall objective is to create value for our shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality and related space. We strive to achieve that by providing an attractive price-value entertainment and dining experience; by attracting and retaining quality personnel; and by focusing on unit-level operating performance. Aside from our operating strategy, we employ a capital allocation strategy.
Capital Allocation Strategy
 
Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided however, that we may deviate from this strategy if the circumstances warrant. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock, or other strategic rationale in management’s opinion, as baseline, we believe we are able to make better investment decisions.
 
Based on our current capital allocation strategy:
 

● | We consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide a minimum cash on cash return of 25%-33%, absent an otherwise strategic rationale; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We consider disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use; 
● | We consider buying back our own stock if the after-tax yield on free cash flow climbs over 10%; 
● | We consider paying down our most expensive debt if it makes sense on a tax adjusted basis, or there is an otherwise strategic rationale. 

COMPETITION
 
The adult entertainment and the restaurant/sports bar businesses are highly competitive with respect to price, service and location. All of our nightclubs compete with a number of locally owned adult clubs, some of whose brands may have name recognition that equals that of ours. The names “Rick’s” and “Rick’s Cabaret,” “Tootsie’s Cabaret,” “XTC Cabaret,” “Scarlett’s,” “Silver City,” “Club Onyx,” “Downtown Cabaret,” “Temptations,” “The Seville,” “Jaguars,” “Hoops Cabaret,” and “Foxy’s Cabaret” are proprietary. In the restaurant/sports bar business, “Bombshells” is also proprietary. We believe that the combination of our existing brand name recognition and the distinctive entertainment environment that we have created allows us to compete effectively in the industry and within the cities where we operate. Although we believe that we are well positioned to compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our high level of name recognition and prestige within the marketplace.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business activities. Particularly in Texas, the authority to issue a permit to sell alcoholic beverages is governed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (“TABC”), which has the authority, in its discretion, to issue the appropriate permits. We presently hold a Mixed Beverage Permit and a Late Hour Permit at numerous Texas locations. Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana, Louisiana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York have similar laws that may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or that may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. It is our policy, prior to expanding into any new market, to take steps to ensure compliance with all licensing and regulatory requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as the sale of food.

In addition to various regulatory requirements affecting the sale of alcoholic beverages, in many cities where we operate, the location of an adult entertainment cabaret is subject to restriction by city, county or other governmental ordinance. The prohibitions deal generally with distance from schools, churches and other sexually oriented businesses, and contain restrictions based on the percentage of residences within the immediate vicinity of the sexually oriented business. The granting of a sexually oriented business permit is not subject to discretion; the permit must be granted if the proposed operation satisfies the requirements of the ordinance. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol and sexually oriented businesses.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
Our rights to the trade names “RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.,” “Rick’s,” “Rick’s Cabaret,” “Tootsie’s Cabaret,” “Club Onyx,” “XTC Cabaret,” “Temptations,” “Jaguars,” “Downtown Cabaret,” “Cabaret East,” Bombshells Restaurant and Bar,” and “Vee Lounge” are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, “RICK’S AND STARS DESIGN,” and the “BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT & BAR” logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for “RICK’S AND STARS DESIGN” logo, “RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.,” “RICKS,” “RICK’S CABARET,” “CLUB ONYX,” “XTC CABARET,” “SCARLETT’S CABARET,” “SILVER CITY CABARET,” “BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR”, “THE SEVILLE CLUB”, “DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON”, “CLUB DULCE”, “THE BLACK ORCHID”, “HOOPS CABARET”, “STUDIO 80”, “FOXY’S CABARET” and “EXOTIC DANCER” are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the name “TOOTSIES CABARET” We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights.
EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
 
As of September 30, 2017, we had approximately 2,130 employees, of which approximately 180 are in management positions, including corporate and administrative operations, and approximately 1,950 are engaged in entertainment, food and beverage service, including bartenders, waitresses, and certain entertainers. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good. Additionally, as of September 30, 2017, we had independent contractor entertainers, who are self-employed and conduct business at our locations on a non-exclusive basis. Our entertainers at Rick’s Cabaret in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at Jaguars Club in Phoenix, Arizona act as commissioned employees. All employees and independent contractors sign arbitration non-class action participation agreements.
 
We believe that the adult entertainment industry standard of treating entertainers as independent contractors provides us with safe harbor protection to preclude payroll tax assessment for prior years. We have prepared plans that we believe will protect our profitability in the event that the sexually oriented business industry is required in all states to convert entertainers, who are now independent contractors, into employees. See related discussion in “Risk Factors.”
