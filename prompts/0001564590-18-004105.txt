Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops innovative medicines in areas of high unmet medical need. Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain. We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates. These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action. We refer to our drug candidates where we retain at least U.S. commercial rights as “proprietary programs” and our other drug candidate programs that we have licensed U.S. and potentially other commercial rights to collaboration partners as “collaboration partner programs.” 
 Our Proprietary Programs 
 Immuno-oncology (I-O)
 In the area of I-O, we are developing medicines that target biological pathways, which stimulate and sustain the body’s immune response in order to fight cancer. We are developing medicines designed to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of key immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to increase their numbers and improve their function to recognize and attack cancer cells. 
 NKTR-214, our lead I-O candidate, is a biologic with biased signaling through one of the IL-2 receptor subunits (CD 122) that can stimulate proliferation and growth of tumor-killing immune cells in the tumor micro-environment and increase expression of PD-1 on these immune cells.
 On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (BMS Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS’ human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo® (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in at least five tumor types and eight indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial). Under the BMS Agreement, BMS is responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by us in connection with third party contract research organizations, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards. Each party is otherwise responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combination Therapy Trial.  Interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial was presented at the 2017 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting in November 2017. We identified the Phase 2 dose for NKTR-214 and we are currently enrolling subjects in the expansion phase of the study.
 On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (the BMS Collaboration Agreement) with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS’s Opdivo® (nivolumab) and Opdivo® plus Yervoy® (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party. The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis. BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement).  
 We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones.  We will book all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214.  We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses. BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214. We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214. NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties. 
 Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which initially includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be updated and expanded only upon mutual agreement of the parties. The parties will share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens based on each party’s relative own
ership interest in the compounds included in the regimens. Nektar’s share of such development costs are limited to an annual cap of $125.0 million. Neither party will develop a therapy using an IL-2 agonist in combination with a small or large molecule that binds to the PD(L)-1 target (and in certain indications the anti-CTLA4 target), in indications included in the joint development plan (each, a Competing Combination), whether alone or in collaboration with any third party, during a limited exclusivity period from the closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement until the later of (i) the first commercial sale of NKTR-214 or (ii) the third anniversary of the closing date, but each party may develop a Competing Combination on its own (but not in collaboration with any third party) during the three years after the end of the 
 4

foregoing limited exclusivity period. If a registration-enabling study included in the joint development plan does not have the first patient enrolled prior to the date which is 14 months from the closing date, subject to allowable delays, the indication covered by that study is no longer subject to the above exclusivity. Other than as described above, Nektar may independently develop and commercialize NKTR-214 either alone or in combination with other Nektar proprietary compounds or third party compounds.
 The closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement  will occur simultaneously with the closing under the Purchase Agreement, which is subject to the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary closing conditions. The closings are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018, upon which the BMS Collaboration Agreement will supersede and replace the existing BMS Agreement.
 On May 22, 2017, we announced a research collaboration that is currently underway bewteen Nektar and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) to evaluate NKTR-214 with five compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio. 
 On September 12, 2017, we announced that we had begun dosing in a clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors, TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).  This study is planned to enroll patients into two separate arms concurrently with the first arm evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with atezolizumab in up to 30 patients, and the second arm evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 30 patients.  This study is not impacted by the BMS Collaboration Agreement and we plan to continue this study through completion.  
 In addition to the existing clinical programs, we plan to continue to advance a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.
 NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to stimulate the innate immune system and promote maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as an intra-tumoral injection in combination with systemic NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. We filed an IND for NKTR-262 in December 2017 and a Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to start before the end of the first quarter of 2018. 
 NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the interleukin-15 pathway in order to activate the body’s innate and adaptive immunity. Signaling of the IL-15 pathway induces the proliferation and growth of CD8 memory T cells so the body’s immune system retains the ability to identify cancer cells if they re-grow in the body. NKTR-255 has also been shown to stimulate NK cell development. NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development.
 Immunology
 In February 2017 we submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) for a new biologic that we are developing, NKTR-358, which is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body that occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. The breakdown of mechanisms assuring recognition of self and non-self is what underlies all autoimmune diseases. A failure of the body's self-tolerance mechanisms is known to result from pathogenic auto reactive T lymphocytes. By increasing the number of regulatory T cells (which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance), these pathogenic auto reactive T cells can be reduced and the proper balance of effector and regulatory T cells can be achieved to restore the body's self-tolerance mechanisms. There is consistent evidence that suboptimal regulatory T cell numbers and their lack of activity play a significant role in a myriad of autoimmune diseases. NKTR-358 is designed to optimally target the IL-2 receptor complex in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells. NKTR-358 is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases. 
 On July 23, 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) to co-develop NKTR-358. We received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to an additional $250.0 million for development and regulatory milestones. We will be responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities. We will also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us. We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs. We are eligible for tiered royalties on global sales up to the low twenties that escalate based upon our level of our contribution to Phase 3 development costs and the level of global product annual sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions. In March 2017, we began the first Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 50 healthy patients. The study is still ongoing. The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose 
 5

trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Pain - NKTR-181 
 NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions. NKTR-181 is currently in Phase 3 clinical development, which we call the SUMMIT Phase 3 program, which includes the SUMMIT-07 efficacy study, a human abuse potential (HAP) study, and the SUMMIT-LTS long-term safety study.  
 On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181 met its primary and secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study. We enrolled the first patient in the first SUMMIT-07 study in February 2015, and we completed enrollment in the study in late 2016. The SUMMIT-07 study compared twice-daily dosing of NKTR-181 tablets to placebo in the treatment of over 600 patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain who were new to opioid therapy (opioid-naïve). SUMMIT-07 evaluated four analgesic doses of NKTR-181 (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg). Patients in the trial achieved an average pain score reduction of over 65% (from 6.73 at screening to 2.32 at randomization) during the dose titration period. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study demonstrated significantly improved chronic back pain relief with NKTR-181 compared to placebo (p=0.0019). Key secondary endpoints of the study also achieved high statistical significance. The study demonstrated that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. 
 On July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study (HAP) for NKTR-181. The HAP study was designed to confirm and assess the relative oral abuse potential of NKTR-181, at its maximum analgesic therapeutic, dose (400 mg) studied in the SUMMIT-07 trial and at a supratherapeutic dose (3 times to 12 times greater than the analgesic dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg used in the SUMMIT-07 trial), compared to common therapeutic doses of oxycodone (40 mg and 60 mg) in 54 healthy non-dependent recreational drug users. For the primary endpoint of Drug Liking, NKTR-181 (400 mg and 600 mg) rated less likable compared to oxycodone 40 mg and 60 mg (p<0.0001), and a supratherapeutic dose of NKTR-181 (1200 mg) rated less likable than oxycodone 60 mg (p=0.0071). Key secondary endpoints of Area Under Effect for Drug Liking (0-1 hours, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours), Drug High and Take Drug Again scores met statistical significance for all doses of NKTR-181 (1200 mg, 600 mg, 400 mg) compared to oxycodone (60 mg). 
 The SUMMIT Phase 3 program also includes a 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS. SUMMIT-LTS is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in 638 patients (opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain. The study was completed in December 2017.  
 Following our success of the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study and the HAP study, we are seeking a partner to support future development and commercialization activities for NKTR-181. We have completed pre-NDA meetings with FDA and we are currently planning to file an NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018.
 Oncology - ONZEALDTM
 ONZEALDTM (also known as NKTR-102, etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate. On March 17, 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALDTM, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The BEACON study compared ONZEALDTM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease. In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALDTM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALDTM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC). Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the ONZEALDTM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance. Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study. We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroup populations—patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.  
 We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALDTM with the European Union (EU) and U.S. health authorities. In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss the BEACON data. In June 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for conditional approval of ONZEALDTM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases and began enrolling in the ATTAIN study, which compares the overall survival in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with ONZEALDTM versus physicians treatment of choice. On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALDTM in the European Union. On July 26, 2017, we filed a request for re-examination of the opinion adopted by the CHMP (the “CHMP Appeal”) but such request was not successful. On December 6, 2017, we received a notice from Daiichi Sankyo Europe 
 6

GmbH (Daiichi), exercising its right to terminate the Collaboration and License Agreement between us and Daiichi (the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement), which termination became effective on February 4, 2018. As a result of the termination, we made a $12.5 million termination payment to Daiichi in December 2017, and all rights and licenses granted to Daiichi under the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement reverted exclusively to Nektar. The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing.  
 Collaboration Partner Programs
 In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK® (naloxegol), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca). MOVANTIK® is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines. AstraZeneca markets and sells MOVANTIK® in the United States in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (Daiichi Inc.). Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin) has exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG® (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. 
 We have a collaboration with Baxalta Incorporated, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc) to develop and commercialize PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients. Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxalta to develop ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE® [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]. ADYNOVATE®, was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. In December 2016 the FDA expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE® for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and for the use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients. In March 2016, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Japan for p
atients aged 12 years and older with Hemophilia A and in November 2017 that approval was extended to include pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and those undergoing surgery.  In late 2016, ADYNOVATE® (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in Switzerland
 for use in Hemophilia A patients aged 12 years and older and in March 2017, ADYNOVI was approved for use in pediatric patients. In November 2016, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Canada for patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of Hemophilia A, including for perioperative management.  In March 2017, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Australia for use in adult and pediatric patients with Hemophilia A. In September 2017, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Colombia for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A I
n January 2018, ADYNOVATE® (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in the European Union for on-demand and prophylactic use in patients 12 years and older with Hemophilia A. In January 2018, ADYNOVATE® was also approved in S. Korea for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A.  
 We retained our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale), pursuant to a drug development program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Bayer Schering) that we transferred to Novartis as part of the 2008 pulmonary asset divestiture transaction. In August 2012, Bayer Schering initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). In September 2016, Bayer Schering presented data from the first Phase 3 trail (RESPIRE 1) at the 2016 European Respiratory Society Annual Meeting which showed in the 14 days on/off regimen, the RESPIRE 1 trial met its primary endpoints of significantly prolonged time to first exacerbation and significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations versus placebo. The top-line results of the second Phase 3 trial (RESPIRE 2) were presented at the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference.  A pooled analysis of the primary efficacy results from  RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 is positive and the data from both RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 indicate that Cipro DPI has a positive safety profile. On November 16, 2017, the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted not to recommend Cipro DPI to be approved for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis.  Bayer Schering has informed us that they are discontinuing development of Cipro DPI in NCFB for the time being as they evaluate possible future options for this asset.  
 We have a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB) for dapirolizumab pegol, a monovalent pegylated Fab antibody fragment against the CD40 ligand (CD40L), being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which the candidate is entering Phase 2 development with UCB partner Biogen Inc. We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Pfizer, Inc. More than 10 products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or the EU. There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced polymer conjugate technologies.

Our Technology Platform
 As a leader in the polymer conjugation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules, including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas. Polymer conjugation or PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) and Roche’s PEGASYS® (PEG-interferon alfa-2a). Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body. Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics. For example, these techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology. Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
 With our expertise and proprietary technology in polymer conjugation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology. Our advanced polymer conjugation technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas. We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
 Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
  
• | improve efficacy or safety of a drug as a result of better pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, longer half-life and sustained exposure of the drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve targeting or binding affinity of a drug to its target receptors with the potential to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity or drug resistance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve solubility of a drug;
--+------------------------------


• | enable oral administration of parenterally-administered drugs, or drugs that must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and increase oral bioavailability of small molecules;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prevent drugs from crossing the blood-brain barrier, or reduce their rate of passage into the brain, thereby limiting undesirable central nervous system effects;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce first-pass metabolism effects of certain drug classes with the potential to improve efficacy, which could reduce the need for other medicines and reduce toxicity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce the rates of drug absorption and of elimination or metabolism by improving stability of the drug in the body and providing it with more time to act on its target;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | differentially alter binding affinity of a drug for multiple receptors, improving its selectivity for one receptor over another; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
 Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates
 Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit. In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally. The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier. An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK®, an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States and the EU. An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.

Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates
 The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile. We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy. With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body. 
Large Molecule Polymer Conjugates (Proteins and Peptides)
 Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today. Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity. Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is Baxalta’s ADYNOVATE®, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. In December 2016, Shire plc announced the FDA approved ADYNOVATE® for use in surgical settings for both adults and pediatric patients, and that the FDA also approved ADYNOVATE® for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
 More recently, our scientists have shown that we can also optimize relative receptor binding characteristics of large molecule conjugates.  For instance, the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has two different receptor complexes in the body that cause opposing effects on the immune system. We have engineered different novel conjugates of IL-2 with optimized differential receptor binding to the IL-2 receptor categories in the immune system.  By biasing the receptor binding of these molecules in complementary ways, we have made two different drug candidates: NKTR-214, which selectively activates effector T cells, which kill tumors; and NKTR-358, which selectively activates regulatory T cells, which can reduce the pathological immune activation that underlies many autoimmune diseases.  
 Large Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates (Cytokines) 
 Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have expanded to include a new approach with biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilizes the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type. In addition, a cytokine’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is NKTR-214, which is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule. 
Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates
 This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody. The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage. This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition. There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA® (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
Our Strategy
 The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
 Advance Our Proprietary Clinical Pipeline of Drug Candidates that Leverage Our Advanced Polymer Conjugate Platform
 Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development. To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments. A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets. For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved. We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies. In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.

Ensure Future Growth of our Proprietary Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Advancement of our Preclinical Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials
 We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business. Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas. We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early-stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
 Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market
 We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis, how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches. When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies. The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
 Continue to Build a Leading Intellectual Property Estate in the Field of Polymer Conjugate Chemistry across Therapeutic Modalities
 We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of polymer conjugate chemistry. To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions, including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.

Overview of Nektar Proprietary Programs
 Immuno-Oncology (I/O)
 NKTR-214 (cytokine immunostimulatory therapy) 
 NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine designed to preferentially activate the IL-2 beta sub-receptors and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in order to proliferate tumor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells). This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs. 
 Under a research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in December 2015 we commenced a Phase 1 study to evaluate NKTR-214 as a monotherapy in a variety of tumor types to evaluate safety and efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in patients with solid tumors.  In addition, the study also assessed the safety profile of NKTR-214, the immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune activation markers in both blood and tumor tissue, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of NKTR-214.  Interim data from this dose-escalation monotherapy trial was presented at the 2016 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting in November 2016.       
The development program for NKTR-214 includes combinations with a number of therapeutic approaches where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for complimentary mechanisms of action.  On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS’ human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo® (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial). The dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 program evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo® is currently enrolling patients at multiple clinical sites. In the first phase of the PIVOT-02 study, we evaluated the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo® in thirty-eight patients. Interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial was presented at the 2017 SITC meeting in November 2017.  We identified the recommended Phase 2 dose for NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo® and are currently enrolling subjects in the expansion phase of the study.  The second phase of the expansion cohorts is evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo®. Under the Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement, BMS is responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with third party contract research organization, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards. Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combined Therapy Trial. Nektar and BMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture and supply its compound for each Combined Therapy Trial and will bear the costs related thereto. 
 On February 13, 2018, we entered into the BMS Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS’s Opdivo® (nivolumab) and Opdivo® plus Yervoy® (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party. The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis. BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1 billion and purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement).  We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones. We will book all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214. We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses. BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214. We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214. NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties.
 Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which initially includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be updated and expanded only upon mutual agreement of the parties. The parties will share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens based on each party’s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimens. Nektar’s share of such development costs are limited to an annual cap of $125.0 million. Neither party will develop any Competing Combination, whether alone or in collaboration with any third party, during a limited exclusivity period from the closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement until the later of (i) the first commercial sale of NKTR-214 or (ii) the third anniversary of the closing date, but each party may develop a Competing Combination on its own (but not in collaboration with any third party) during the three years after the end of the foregoing limited exclusivity period. If a registration-enabling study included in the joint development plan does not have the first patient enrolled prior to the date which is 14 months from the closing date, subject to allowable delays, the indication covered by that study is no longer subject to the above exclusivity. Other than as described above, Nektar may independently develop and commercialize NKTR-214 either alone or in combination with other Nektar proprietary compounds or third party compounds.
 11

The closing under the BMS Collaboration Agreement will occur simultaneously with the closing under a Share Purchase Agreement entered into between us and BMS on February 13, 2018, which is subject to the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary closing conditions. The closings are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018, upon which the BMS Collaboration Agreement will supersede and replace the existing Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement.
 In addition to the clinical trials in collaboration with BMS, we also plan to initiate a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.  
 NKTR-262 
 NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to overcome the body’s dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection to be administered at the start of therapy with NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. We filed an IND for NKTR-262 in December 2017 and expect to begin enrolling patients in the initial Phase 1 study before the end of the first quarter of 2018.  
 NKTR-255 
 NKTR-255 is a memory T cell stimulating cytokine designed to engage the IL-15 pathway to induce long-term T cell activation and improve the quality of T cell memory response to treat cancer. Through optimal engagement of the IL-15Rα/IL-2Rγ receptor complex, NKTR-255 stimulates proliferation and survival of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and enhances formation of long-term immunological memory which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response. Native rhIL-15 is rapidly cleared from the body and must be administered frequently and in high doses limiting its utility due to toxicity. NKTR-255 is designed with IL-15 receptor alpha specificity to optimize biological activity and is uniquely engineered to provide optimal exposure and an improved safety profile.
 Immunology  
 NKTR-358 is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. Current systemic treatments for autoimmune disease, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, suppress the immune system broadly and come with severe side effects. NKTR-358 targets the CD25 sub-receptor in the interleukin-2 pathway in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells, which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance.  
 On July 23, 2017, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we and Lilly will co
‑develop NKTR-358. Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to $250.0 million in additional development and regulatory milestones. We will be responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities. We will also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us. We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs. We are eligible to receive up to double-digit sales royalty rates that escalate based upon our contribution to Phase 3 development cost and the level of global product annual sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
 In February 2017 we filed an IND for NKTR-358 and we are currently enrolling patients in the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR
‑358 in approximately 50 healthy patients.  The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2018 to evaluate NKTR
‑358 in 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other indications.
 Pain - NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic molecule for chronic pain) 
 NKTR-181 is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain. NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies. NKTR-181 was created using Nektar’s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS. The abuse deterrent properties of NKTR-181 are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid. In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.  
 12

In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee. The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design. The study enrolled 295 opioid-naïve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication. Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient’s pain score as compared to the patient’s own baseline. Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient’s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.  
 In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181. In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower "drug liking" scores and reduced "feeling high" scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p < 0.0001). On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.  
 On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study. Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 patients (representing 3% of the patient population) were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181. A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study. NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study. However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies. This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
 In October 2014, we engaged in an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program.  We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study, which we call SUMMIT-07 in February 2015 and we completed enrollment in the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. In this study, we randomized patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which included a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 was given to all patients, followed by a 12-week double-blind randomized period where subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo. On February 29, 2016, we increased the sample size of this trial by approximately 200 patients following a pre-specified sample size assessment by the independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study. The protocol for the NKTR-181 study defined only two possible outcomes for this pre-planned blinded interim sample size assessment: (1) if the conditional powering at the midpoint of the trial fell between 50-85%, the sample size was to be increased by approximately 200 patients; or (2) if the conditional powering fell below 50%, or above 85%, the sample size was not to be changed. The IAC’s determination was nondiscretionary and was based upon our determination of pre-defined acceptable power to detect a statistically significant difference between NKTR-181 and placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint. In January 2017, we started enrollment in a second human abuse liability study where we are assessing abuse liability of supra-therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in order to further evaluate NKTR-181 for labeling and scheduling purposes. On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181 met its primary and secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy Study. On July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study for NKTR-181, which we call the HAP study.  
 The SUMMIT Phase 3 program also includes a 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS.  SUMMIT-LTS is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in over 600 patients (opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain. The study was completed in December 2017.   
 Following our success of the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study and the HAP study, we are seeking a partner to support future development and commercialization activities for NKTR-181. We have completed pre-NDA meetings with the FDA to discuss plans for an NDA submission and we are currently planning to file an NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018.
 According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity. Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain. However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion. The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2016 report, there are 1.9 million Americans which have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers. This same report attributes 18,893 overdose deaths in 2015 were related to prescription pain relievers.

Oncology - ONZEALDTM (next generation, long-acting topoisomerase I inhibitor)
 ONZEALDTM (previously known as NKTR-102 or etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.  In 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALDTM, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with ONZEALDTM), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The BEACON study compared ONZEALDTM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease. In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALDTM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALDTM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC). Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the hazard ratio for survival in the ONZEALDTM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance. Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.  We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups—patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
 We have also conducted clinical studies for ONZEALDTM in other solid tumor settings. In 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study for ONZEALDTM in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of ONZEALDTM monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene. The Phase 2 clinical study was designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or EU.  
 We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate ONZEALDTM in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers. The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen. On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.  In addition to the clinical study of ONZEALDTM being conducted by us, we have also provided support for four investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies being conducted for ONZEALDTM. On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALDTM in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute. In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study. A separate investigator-initiated clinical study is also being conducted at Stanford to evaluate ONZEALDTM in patients with brain metastasis from primary lung cancer. On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALDTM in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALDTM in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
 We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALDTM with the EU and U.S. health authorities. In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the EMA to discuss the BEACON data. In June 2016, we filed an MAA for conditional approval of ONZEALDTM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases treated with ONZEALDTM versus physicians treatment of choice in the ATTAIN trial. On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALD™ in the EU. On July 26, 2017, we filed a request for re-examination of the opinion adopted by the CHMP (the “CHMP Appeal”) but we were informed by the CHMP in November 2017 that our request was not successful. On December 6, 2017 we received notice of termination from Daiichi exercising its right to terminate the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement, which termination became effective on February 4, 2018. As a result of the termination, we made a $12.5 million termination payment to Daiichi in December 2017, and all rights and licenses granted to Daiichi under the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement reverted exclusively to Nektar. The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing.    
 According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year. The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman’s life is a little less than one in eight (approximately 12%). In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and about 40,610 women will die from breast cancer. Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease. There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.

 With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
 Overview of Collaboration Partner Programs
 We have a number of product candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners where we invented the drug candidate or where our collaboration partners have licensed our proprietary intellectual property to enable one of their drug candidates. Our agreements with collaboration partners may involve several elements including a technology license as well as the development, commercialization, and manufacturing and supply obligations. We typically receive consideration from our collaboration partners in the form of upfront payments, or milestone payments and royalties on sales. In certain cases, we also manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer materials to our partners.
 MOVANTIK® and MOVANTIK® Fixed-Dose Combination Products (MOVANTIK® previously referred to as naloxegol or NKTR-118 and MOVANTIK® Fixed-Dose Combination Products previously referred to as NKTR-119), License Agreement with AstraZeneca AB
 In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK® and MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination products. MOVANTIK® was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca. MOVANTIK® is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist which is a medication  for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications. Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors. When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur. OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
 On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK® as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.  On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG® (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s). The EC’s approval applies to all 28 EU member countries plus Iceland and Norway. AstraZeneca launched the commercial sales of MOVANTIK® in the United States in March 2015 and MOVENTIG® in Germany, the first EU member country, in August 2015. Under the terms of our license agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment of $125.0 million to us and has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for MOVANTIK® and MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination products.  We received milestone payments of $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance of regulatory approval applications of MOVANTIK® by the FDA and the EMA, respectively, in 2013. We received an additional developmental milestone payment of $35.0 million upon the FDA’s approval of MOVANTIK® in 2014 and a total of $140.0 million upon commercial launches in 2015, including $100.0 million for MOVANTIK® in the U.S. and $40.0 million for MOVENTIG® in Germany. We are also entitled to up to $375.0 million in sales milestones for MOVANTIK® if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels. For the MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels. For both MOVANTIK® and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sales in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the EU and rest of world, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales. On March 1, 2016, AstraZeneca announced that it had entered into an agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin), granting Kirin exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG® in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.  Nektar receives a 40% share of royalty payments made by Kirin to AstraZeneca will be financially equivalent to Nektar receiving high single-digit to low double-digit royalties depending on Kirin’s annual net sales levels.  Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a 
 16

specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country. AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK® with opioids.
 There are a number of patents relevant to MOVANTIK®, some of which are listed in the FDA’s “Orange Book.” The “Orange Book” currently lists six patents for MOVANTIK®. Four patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,500, 7,662,365, 7,786,133 and 9,012,469) are “composition of matter patents” - one of which has a patent expiry extending into 2032. In addition, two patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 8,067,431 and 8,617,530) are directed to methods of treatment.
 ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855) and Long-Acting Therapies for Hemophilia A, Agreement with Subsidiaries of Baxalta Incorporated
 In September 2005, we entered into an exclusive research, development, license, manufacturing and supply agreement (Baxalta License Agreement) with certain subsidiaries of Baxalta (which has been acquired by Shire plc), formerly Baxter before the separation of Baxalta from Baxter in July 2015, to develop products with an extended half-life for the treatment and prophylaxis of Hemophilia A patients using our proprietary PEGylation technology. The first product in this collaboration, ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein. ADYNOVATE® is a full-length PEGylated longer-acting recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) that was developed to increase the half-life of ADVATE® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method). We are entitled to up to $55.0 million in total development and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales varying by product and country of sale. The royalties start in the mid-single digits for net sales of ADYNOVATE® up to $1.2 billion and then in the low teens for net sales exceeding $1.2 billion. Our right to receive these royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the expiration of patent rights in certain designated countries or in that particular country. 
 In November 2015, ADYNOVATE® was approved by the FDA for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. On November 30, 2015, Baxalta announced that it had initiated sales of ADYNOVATE® in the U.S.  In December 2016 the FDA expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE® for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and for the use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients. In March 2016, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Japan for patients aged 12 years and older with Hemophilia A and in November 2017 that approval was extended to include pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and those undergoing surgery. In late 2016, ADYNOVATE® (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in Switzerland for use in Hemophilia A patients aged 12 years and older and in March 2017, ADYNOVI was approved for use in pediatric patients. In November 2016, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Canada for patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of Hemophilia A, including for perioperative management.  In March 2017, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Australia for use in adult and pediatric patients with Hemophilia A. In September 2017, ADYNOVATE® was approved in Colombia for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A. In January 2018 ADYNOVATE® (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in the European Union for on-demand and prophylactic use in patients 12 years and older with Hemophilia A. In January 2018, ADYNOVATE® was also approved in S. Korea for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A.  
 In October 2017, we entered into a right to sublicense agreement with Baxalta, under which we granted to Baxalta the right to grant a nonexclusive sublicense to certain patents to a third party that were previously exclusively licensed to Baxalta under the Baxalta License Agreement.  Under the right to sublicense agreement, Baxalta paid us $12.0 million in November 2017 and agreed to pay us single digit royalty payments based upon net sales of the third party products covered under the sublicense throughout the term of the right to sublicense agreement.
 Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hemophilia occurs in approximately one in 5,000 live births and there are about 20,000 people with hemophilia in the US. All races and ethnic groups are affected. Hemophilia A is four times as common as Hemophilia B while more than half of patients with Hemophilia A have the severe form of hemophilia. In 2014, according to the Evaluate Group, sales of FVIII replacement products exceeded $6.0 billion globally.
 Amikacin Inhale (BAY41-6551, formerly NKTR-061), Agreement with Bayer Healthcare LLC
 In August 2007, we entered into a co-development, license and co-promotion agreement (Bayer Agreement) with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop a specially-formulated Amikacin (BAY41-6551, Amikacin Inhale, formerly called NKTR-061) for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonias. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer was responsible for most future clinical development and commercialization costs, all activities to support worldwide regulatory filings, approvals and related activities, further development of formulated Amikacin and final product packaging for Amikacin Inhale. We were responsible for all future development, manufacturing and supply of the nebulizer device for clinical and commercial use. 
 17

In April 2013, Bayer initiated enrollment in a global Phase 3 clinical study, which it calls INHALE, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Amikacin Inhale versus aerosolized placebo in the treatment of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia receiving standard of care intravenous antibiotics. On November 24, 2017, Bayer announced that the Phase 3 Amikacin Inhale clinical program did not meet its primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints.  On December 14, 2017, we received notice of termination from Bayer of the Bayer Agreement effective as of January 13, 2018. No payment obligations to Bayer arose as a result of the termination of the Bayer Agreement.  
 Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale), Bayer Schering Pharma AG 
 We were a party to a collaborative research, development and commercialization agreement with Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Bayer Schering), related to the development of an inhaled powder formulation of ciprofloxacin delivered by way of a dry powder inhaler, Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) for the treatment of chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. On December 31, 2008, we assigned the agreement to Novartis Pharma AG in connection with the completion of the pulmonary asset sale transaction. However, we retained our economic interest in the future potential net sales royalties if Cipro DPI is approved by health authorities and is successfully commercialized by Bayer Schering. In August 2012, Bayer Schering initiated a Phase 3 clinical development program which it calls RESPIRE for Cipro DPI in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). In these patients with NCFB, the bronchial tubes are enlarged, allowing mucus to pool and making the area prone to infection. In September 2016, Bayer Schering presented data from the first Phase 3 trail (RESPIRE 1) at the 2016 European Respiratory Society Annual Meeting which showed that the study met its co-primary endpoints for the every 14-day dosing arm of Cipro DPI. The second Phase 3 trial (RESPIRE 2) completed recruitment in September 2016. On April 5, 2017, an abstract with data from the RESPIRE 2 trial was published by the American Thoracic Society in connection with the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference. A pooled analysis of the primary efficacy results of RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 is positive and the data of both RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 indicated that Cipro DPI has a positive safety profile. On November 16, 2017, the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted not to recommend Cipro DPI to be approved for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis.    Bayer Schering has informed us that they are discontinuing development of Cipro DPI in NCFB for the time being as they evaluate possible future options for this asset.  
 FOVISTA® (Anti-PDGF Therapy), Agreement with Ophthotech Corporation
 On May 19, 2014, Ophthotech entered into a Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to develop and commercialize Fovista® and related combination products in all countries outside of the U.S. Under the original license and supply agreement entered into between us and Ophthotech, we received a $19.8 million payment in June 2014 in connection with this licensing agreement. In December 2016 Ophthotech announced that two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for Fovista® failed to meet their primary endpoints. In August 2017, Opthotech announced that the third Fovista® Phase 3 trial also failed to meet its primary endpoint. On October 27, 2017, we agreed to terminate our license and supply agreement with Ophthotech.  
 PEGPH20, Agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
 In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Halozyme pursuant to which we granted Halozyme a worldwide, limited exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize particular products that use our proprietary PEGylation materials linked only with certain qualifying hyaluronidase protein molecules including PEGPH20. According to Halozyme, certain cancers, including pancreatic, breast, colon and prostate, have been shown to accumulate high levels of hyaluronan (HA). Halozyme’s FDA-approved, HYLENEX® recombinant human hyaluronidase, rHuPH20, is administered subcutaneously and temporarily and reversibly degrades HA to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids and for subcutaneous fluid administration. However, rHuPH20 acts only locally at the injection site, is rapidly inactivated in the body, and does not survive in the blood. PEGPH20 is an investigational PEGylated form of rHuPH20, under development by Halozyme to increase the half-life of the compound in the blood and allow for intravenous administration. Halozyme is currently evaluating PEGPH20 in a Phase 3 clinical study combining PEGPH20 with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) (HALO 109-301), in Phase 1b clinical testing for PEGPH20 with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (HALO 107-101), in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with HALAVEN® (eribulin) in patients treated with up to two lines of prior therapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in patients with previously treated metastatic PDA, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with gastric cancer and in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gall bladder cancer (HALO 110-101/MATRIX). We are entitled to future development milestones and royalties on net sales subject to reduction in the absence of patent coverage. Our right to receive royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of twelve years after first commercial sale of the product or expiration of patent rights in the particular country. We also manufacture and supply Halozyme with clinical and future commercial supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials used in the manufacture of PEGPH20.

SEMPRANA®, Agreement with MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan, Inc.)
 In June 2004, we entered into a license agreement with MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MAP), which includes a worldwide, exclusive license, to certain of our patents and other intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize a formulation of dihydroergotamine (DHE) for administration to patients via the pulmonary or nasal delivery route, which resulted in the development of SEMPRANA®, formerly known as LEVADEX®. In 2006, we amended and restated this agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to receive certain milestone payments based on development criteria that are solely the responsibility of MAP and royalties based on net sales of SEMPRANA®. Our right to receive royalties for the net sales of SEMPRANA® under the license agreement in any particular country will expire upon the later of (i) 10 years after first commercial sale in that country, (ii) the date upon which the licensed know-how becomes known to the general public, and (iii) expiration of certain patent claims, each on a country-by-country basis. Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material, uncured default of the other party.
 SEMPRANA® is a self-administered formulation of DHE using an inhaler device that is currently under review by the FDA.  On May 26, 2011, MAP submitted an NDA to the FDA for SEMPRANA®. In March of 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter to MAP identifying issues relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls deficiencies of the product at a contracted third party manufacturer. On April 17, 2013, the FDA issued a second complete response letter identifying issues related to a supplier that provided the canister filling unit for SEMPRANA®. In June 2014, Allergan which acquired MAP as described below, announced that it had received a third complete response letter from the FDA related to specifications around content uniformity on the improved canister filling process and on standards for device actuation. Allergan has responded to the FDA’s latest complete response letter and has stated that it continues to work with the FDA to resolve outstanding Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) issues.
 On January 28, 2011, MAP entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Allergan, Inc. (Allergan), pursuant to which Allergan received a co-exclusive license to market and promote SEMPRANA® to neurologists and pain specialists in the U.S. Under this arrangement, Allergan paid MAP an upfront payment of $60.0 million. MAP was also entitled to receive up to an additional $97.0 million in the form of regulatory milestones, which includes milestones for the FDA’s acceptance of filing of the SEMPRANA® NDA and first commercial sale associated with the initial acute migraine indication. On March 1, 2013, Allergan completed a merger and acquisition transaction with MAP pursuant to which MAP become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan. In December 2017, we, MAP and Allergan entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release. Pursuant to this agreement, Allergan paid Nektar $15.0 million in December 2017 in exchange for relief of any claims related to our share of payments received by MAP from Allergan as well as a specified development milestone payment due to Nektar.  
 Dapirolizumab Pegol
 In 2010, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma S.A., (UCB) under which we granted UCB a worldwide, exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize an anti-CD40L PEGylated Fab being developed by UCB and their partner Biogen Idec, for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythemastosus (SLE). In 2014, UCB and Biogen completed a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in approximately 24 patients with SLE.  Data from the study was published in September 2015 at the Annual American College of Rheumatology Meeting and showed that multiple administrations of dapirolizumab pegol given over 12 weeks were well-tolerated and the safety profile supported further development of the compound.  Exploratory analyses from the same study showed greater improvement in clinical measures of disease activity in the dapriolizumab pegol group versus placebo. In 2016, UCB initiated a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical study followed by an observational period  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patients with moderately to severely active SLE receiving stable standard of care medications. This Phase 2 clinical trial is currently recruiting patients.
 Neulasta®, Agreement with Amgen, Inc.
 In July 1995, we entered into a non-exclusive supply and license agreement (the 1995 Agreement) with Amgen, Inc., pursuant to which we licensed our proprietary PEGylation technology to be used in the development and manufacture of Neulasta®. Neulasta® selectively stimulates the production of neutrophils that are depleted by cytotoxic chemotherapy, a condition called neutropenia that makes it more difficult for the body to fight infections. On October 29, 2010, we amended and restated the 1995 Agreement by entering into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement (the 2010 Agreement) and an amended and restated license agreement with Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (together referred to as Amgen). Under the terms of the 2010 Agreement, we guarantee the manufacture and supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials (Polymer Materials) to Amgen in an existing manufacturing suite to be used exclusively for the manufacture of Polymer Materials for Amgen in our manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama. This supply arrangement is on a non-exclusive basis (other than the use of the manufacturing suite and certain equipment) whereby we are free to manufacture and supply the Polymer Materials to any other third party and Amgen is free to procure the Polymer Materials from any other third party. Under the terms of the 2010 Agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront payment in return for guaranteeing supply of certain quantities of Polymer Materials to Amgen and the Additional Rights 
 19

described below, and Amgen will pay manufacturing fees calculated based on fixed and variable components applicable to the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen and delivered by us. Amgen has no minimum purchase commitments. If quantities of the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen exceed specified quantities (with each specified quantity representing a small portion of the quantity that we historically supplied to Amgen), significant additional payments become payable to us in return for guaranteeing supply of additional quantities of the Polymer Materials.
 The term of the 2010 Agreement runs through October 29, 2020. In the event we become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, we cease to own or control the manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, we fail to manufacture and supply the Polymer Materials or certain other events occur, Amgen or its designated third party will have the right to elect, among certain other options, to take title to the dedicated equipment and access the manufacturing facility to operate the manufacturing suite solely for the purpose of manufacturing the Polymer Materials (Additional Rights). Amgen may terminate the 2010 Agreement for convenience or due to an uncured material default by us. Either party may terminate the 2010 Agreement in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
 PEGASYS®, Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the MIRCERA® product. In February 2012, we sold all of our future rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA® effective as of January 1, 2012. This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA® agreement.
 Government Regulation
 Product Development and Approval Process
 The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
 The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms. If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
  
• | extensive preclinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND prior to commencing clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for the intended indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extensive pharmaceutical development for the characterization of the chemistry, manufacturing process and controls for the active ingredient and drug product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests, including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA, and clinical trials,  may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical  data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations. The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review. Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
 Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted. The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
  
• | determine the preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determine dosage and regimen of administration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability. The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk. In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
 Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product. The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval. Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product. Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs. After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
 Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment. Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization. Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.

They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
 For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molecule. The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBER are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction. In the case of our product candidates, CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review. The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
 Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II, or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
 In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, we may still participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device, polymer conjugation materials or drug. For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND. The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
 Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
 In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products. Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be “clinically superior” to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a “major contribution to patient care” or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
 In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
 Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing 
 Sales of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval depends, in part, on the coverage and reimbursement status of those products. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors 
 23

may also refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Further, private payors often follow the coverage and payment policies established by certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which require manufacturers to comply with certain rebate, price reporting, and other obligations.  For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, among others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under which the manufacturer agrees to report certain prices to the government and pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients, as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.  Further, in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the price of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort.  The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement, among other controls. Adoption of price controls or other cost-containment measures could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments or private payors will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.  If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24

 
• | provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), enacted in 2010, expanded the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b.  Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 
 Legislative and Regulatory Landscape
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Further, the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections and subsequent developments have caused the future state of many core aspects of the current health care marketplace to be uncertain, as the new Presidential Administration and Congress have repeatedly expressed a desire to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act.  While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future that could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Furthermore, federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the privacy sector have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We own more than 250 U.S. and 800 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates. More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, 
 25

methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates. Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of which we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001. Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid). In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
 In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon, pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party’s PEGylation patent portfolio.
 On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale). In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG. Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma AG grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis. Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551 partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to “We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.” In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs. Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party’s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages. Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law. Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly. Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent. We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.”
 U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology. The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.”
 26

It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 Customer Concentrations
 Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties or product sales revenue. The revenue generated under the Lilly Agreement and the license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB represented 42% and 12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. No other collaboration partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Backlog
 Pursuant to our collaboration agreements, we manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer conjugation materials. Inventory is produced and sales are made pursuant to customer purchase orders for delivery. The volume of our proprietary polymer conjugation materials actually ordered by our customers, as well as shipment schedules, are subject to frequent revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ needs and our manufacturing capacity. In our partnered programs where we provide contract research services, those services are typically provided under a work plan that is subject to frequent revisions that change based on the development needs and status of the program. The backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including scheduled date of manufacture and delivery and development program status. In light of industry practice and our own experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results.
Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly-evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world. We frequently compete with pharmaceutical companies and other institutions with greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
Science and Technology Competition
 We believe that our proprietary and partnered products will compete with others in the market on the basis of one or more of the following parameters: efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. We face intense science and technology competition from a multitude of technologies seeking to enhance the efficacy, safety and ease of use of approved drugs and new drug molecule candidates. A number of the drug candidates in our pipeline have direct and indirect competition from large pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies. With our advanced polymer conjugate technologies, we believe we have competitive advantages relating to factors such as efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost for certain applications and molecules. We constantly monitor scientific and medical developments in order to improve our current technologies, seek licensing opportunities where appropriate, and determine the best applications for our technology platforms.
 In the fields of advanced polymer conjugate technologies, our competitors include Biogen Idec Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, NOF Corporation, and Novo Nordisk A/S (assets formerly held by Neose Technologies, Inc.). Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing advanced polymer conjugate technology or technologies intended to deliver similar scientific and medical benefits. Some of these companies license intellectual property or PEGylation materials to other companies, while others apply the technology to create their own drug candidates. 
 27

Product and Program Specific Competition
 NKTR-214 (immunostimulatory CD122-biased cytokine) 
 There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.  Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space. 
 NKTR-358 
 There are a number of competitors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytokine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Juno Therapeutics and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2-based and toleragen-based therapies (Celgene Corporation, Amgen Inc., Tolera Therapeutics, Inc., and Caladrius BioSciences, Inc.).
 NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic molecule for chronic pain)
 There are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies. Potential competitors include Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Egalet Ltd, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo Health Solutions Inc., KemPharm, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
 MOVANTIK® (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118) (orally-available peripheral opioid antagonist)
 There are no other once-daily oral drugs that act specifically to block or reverse the action of opioids on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which are approved specifically for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. The only approved oral treatment for opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic, non-cancer pain is a twice daily oral therapy called AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which acts by specifically activating CIC-2 chloride channels in the gastrointestinal tract to increase secretions. AMITIZA® is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and Takeda. There is also a subcutaneous treatment and an oral treatment known as RELISTOR® which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Ltd (formerly Salix) under a license from Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In 2014, RELISTOR® Subjectaneous Injection was approved by the FDA for adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. On July 22, 2016, Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) oral tablets for the treatment of OCI in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain was approved by FDA. Other therapies used to treat OIC and OBD include over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, such as docusate sodium, senna, and milk of magnesia. These therapies do not address the underlying cause of constipation as a result of opioid use and are generally viewed as ineffective or only partially effective to treat the symptoms of OIC and OBD.
 There are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations. Potential competitors include Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Actavis plc, Purdue Pharma L.P. in collaboration with Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Mundipharma Int. Limited, Theravance, Inc., Develco Pharma, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. 
 ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855, PEGylated rFVIII)
 On June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec ’s ELOCTATETM [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A. ELOCTATETM is intended to be an extended half-life Factor VIII therapy with prolonged circulation in the body with the potential to extend the interval between prophylactic infusions. Prior to its 2014 approval, the fusion protein in ELOCTATETM was not used outside of the clinical trial setting for Hemophilia A patients. There are other long-acting Factor VIII programs in late-stage development for Hemophilia A patients. Bayer Healthcare and Novo Nordisk have ongoing Phase 3 clinical development programs for longer acting Factor VIII proteins based on PEGylation technology approaches. These programs, if developed successfully and approved by health authorities, would be competitors in the longer acting Factor VIII market.
 28

ONZEALDTM (next-generation, long acting topoisomerase I inhibitor)
 There are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for advanced breast cancer. These therapies are only partially effective in treating advanced or metastatic breast cancer and none of them have a specific indication in either the U.S. or Europe for treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer and co-existing brain metastases.  These therapies include but are not limited to: Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor® (everolimus), Ellence® (epirubicin), Gemzar® (gemcitabine), Halaven® (eribulin), Herceptin® (trastuzumab), Ixempra® (ixabepilone), Navelbine® (vinolrebine), Xeloda® (capecitabine) and Taxotere® (docetaxel). Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eisai, Inc., Roche Holding Group (including its Genentech subsidiary), GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly & Co., Sanofi Aventis S.A., and others.
 Research and Development
 Our total research and development expenditures can be disaggregated into the following significant types of expenses (in millions):
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
Third party and direct materials costs | $ | 125.4 | | $ | 98.2 | | $ | 89.3 
Personnel, overhead and other costs | | 113.5 | | | 84.6 | | | 77.8 
Stock-based compensation and depreciation | | 29.6 | | | 21.0 | | | 15.7 
Research and development expense | $ | 268.5 | | $ | 203.8 | | $ | 182.8

Manufacturing and Supply
 We have a manufacturing facility located in Huntsville, Alabama that is capable of manufacturing our proprietary PEGylation materials for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The facility is also used to produce APIs to support the early phases of clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates. The facility and associated equipment are designed and operated to be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
 As we do not maintain the capability to manufacture APIs (including biologics) nor finished drug products for all of our development programs, we primarily utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for us. We source drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities from one or more suppliers. For the drug starting materials necessary for our proprietary drug candidate development, we have agreements for the supply of such drug components with drug manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. However, from time to time, we source critical raw materials and services from one or a limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that if such supply or services were interrupted, it would materially harm our business. In addition, we typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. We also utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture APIs required for later phases of clinical development and eventual commercialization for us under all applicable laws and regulations.
 Environment
 As a manufacturer of PEG reagents for the U.S. market, we are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations.
