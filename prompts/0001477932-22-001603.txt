Our Business

Tautachrome operates in the internet applications space, a large business space we believe to be uniquely able to make possible fast growing and novel business. The iPhone, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and numerous other examples are reminders of the ability of the internet applications business space to surprise us with new business universes “out of nowhere.” A recent arrival in the internet applications space is blockchain technology, a technology empowering entities  to create ecosystems of trade based on self-introduced and globally useable secure trading currencies. Blockchain technology has added a significant element to Tautachrome’s business plans and activities. In addition, the subsequent development of a new patent pending technology dubbed ARknet technology that exploits augmented reality in a new solution to the purchasing interaction between global consumers and providers has been licensed by the Company for development.

Tautachrome is currently pursuing three main avenues of business activity based on our patented activated imaging technology, our blockchain trading currency, and the ARknet patent pending technology (together banded “KlickZie” technology):

1. | KlickZie ARknet technology business: Our licensed activity to develop and monetize a new augmented reality (“AR”) technology called “ARknet technology which permits goods and services providers to establish geolocated augmented reality interfaces, called ARks, allowing consumers to interact with inside info on the provider’s products, specials and discounts with live purchasing provided. A provider’s ARk may be located anywhere on earth, at a store location, or anywhere else the provider may desire. The ARknet is a fintech platform connecting consumers to providers in the global $48 trillion household purchasing market, using augmented reality as the medium of interaction.

2. | KlickZie’s blockchain trading currency ecosystem: our recently added activity to create our own KlickZie blockchain and trading currency to incentivize consumer usage of the ARknet paltform, and 
3. | KlickZie Activated Digital Imagery business: our longstanding flagship activity to develop and monetize downloadable apps based on our patented KlickZie trusted imaging technology and based on our patented trusted image-based social interactions using the pictures and videos that smartphone users generate on the web using their KlickZie imaging app. 

1. ARk Business Activity

On October 17, 2018, the Company licensed and is now developing the ARknet technology, a Fintech patent pending technology aimed at the global household goods and services market. ARks are floating interactive pictures (ARk Symbols) only visible around you in the Augmented Reality view provided by the ARknet app using the camera imager in your smartphone. ARks are intended for goods and service providers as a way to draw attention to customers in the vicinity of a provider’s ARk Symbol. Shoppers and buyers seeing a Symbol can interact with the provider’s goods or services via the ARk Symbol. The picture above is a shopping mall scene, where two stores, Claire’s on your right, and rue 21 etc! on your left, are shown displaying interactive ARk symbols. Claire’s ARk is a “standard” ARk symbol, while rue 21 etc! uses a picture of their “etc. Gold” perfume product as their ARk symbol. Either way, using their smartphone imager an ARknet app users can touch the store’s ARk Symbol and on their smartphone access the provider’s Ark page containing interest-grabbing information, including pictures or videos of today’s specials, in-ARk purchase and checkout features, reviews, links, menus, social media profiles or anything else the store wants to advertise.

Arks may be mobile ARks, using the app user’s mobile device to mobilize the ARk location, or stationary ARks, using a set geo location determined by coordinates or determined by fixing the ARk location by moving the ARk owner’s mobile device to a desired location and setting the stationary ARk’s location there. 

Providers may create their ARks, decide on their ARk Symbol, choose their Symbol geolocations and provide for license payment to the Company, using features in the ARk app.

We intend the ARk app to be free to consumers and other users wishing to use the app to survey their environ for the presence of ARk symbols. 

We envision a KlickZie ARknet with billions of users and ARks connecting humanity, commerce, information, crypto currency, and innovation in useful ways. Plus, we want to return the ownership of users’ information and valuable items such as images and video, back to where it rightfully belongs, the individual user.

2. KlickZie blockchain trading currency 

In late 2017 we formed a development team of providers to develop a KlickZie blockchain (branded the “zChain”) to handle transactions using a cryptographically secured trading currency designated the “KLK” currency. The KLK is intended to be the currency of the imagery trading ecosystem allowing KlickZie users to monetize their pictures and videos and thereby enabling the ability to conduct widescale buying, selling and licensing of KlickZie pictures and videos.

Our development team consists of individuals from the blockchain development company Kelecorix, Inc., and individuals from the image storage company Honeycomb Digital, LLC. The team has developed the software and architecture for the implementation of a simple KlickZie app that seeks to implement the ownership properties of KlickZie imaging.

Like other blockchains, the zChain is intended to run in a decentralized manner. “Smart contracts” residing on the zChain would implement the buying, selling licensing and other trading features on the zChain. Such smart contracts would implement a commission on zChain transactions that involve participation by the Company to complete (for instance the certification of the validity of KlickZie imagery when requested).

Because KlickZie users own the imagery they create, the use of KlickZie imagery by others, including advertisers, could be done through the execution of a smart contract on the zChain transferring KLK currency from the advertiser to the user.

3. KlickZie technology-based business activity

Tautachrome’s KlickZie technology addresses two features of the internet age that create a new need and a new opportunity. The first is the need for a way to trust the pictures and videos you see on the web. Right now the trillions of pictures and frames of video on the web are so easily and often falsified that trustability of internet imagery is essentially zero. For this reason we believe that a universally available, downloadable system that turns the everyday pictures and videos we take from our smartphones into imagery that can be trustable to others seeing it, will have substantial value . We would like to see only two kinds of imagery come to exist on the web: imagery whose trustworthiness everybody can be certain of, and all the rest of the imagery for which the notion of trust is meaningless. The KlickZie system aims to satisfy the requirement of for universal trustability for the ordinary imagery it produces.

The technology required for trustability also opens the door to a new opportunity. This is the opportunity to enable people to use KlickZie pictures and videos on the web to readily and safely interact with each other via the imagery itself. It is frequently the case that when you run across interesting imagery on the web you cannot know anything about it, including who the author is, who else may have seen it, or what others may think or know about it. By allowing people to interact with interesting or important pictures or videos by using the imagery itself as the portal of communication, the KlickZie system can add the viewpoints and the information offerings of interacting people to the richness of pictures and videos. This can be carried by the system into the future along with the imagery, as an evolving information structure of interaction and imagery.

KlickZie imaging Platform

Users will download KlickZie’s free software into their mobile device (iPhone, Android or other smartphone). The software, an upgrade to the smartphone’s camera software, will activate the pictures and videos taken by their device using proprietary KlickZie marking technology. Behind the scenes, KlickZie will capture the imagery and available metadata related to the imaging event, and mark the imagery and its metadata with advanced and invisible KlickZie marking technology.

KlickZie activation seeks to add a new utility to ordinary pictures and videos. Other KlickZie users who come across an activated picture can communicate with the author of the picture, or with amenable others who have seen the picture or with the data stored in the picture by clicking or touching the picture (“touch-to-comm”). We intend the picture itself by click or touch to make the communication happen no matter where or how you come across an activated picture.

What happens to an activated picture from its creation onward is intended to be added to the picture’s data for tracking into the future. Activated pictures seek to answer many questions. For example, in a group photo you could ask: Have any of the people in my contacts list interacted with this picture? Are any of them engaging it right now? Who else besides my contacts have already engaged this picture in some way? Who took it? Where? When?

The upshot is that activation seeks to allow effective touch to comm with the authors and viewers of smartphone pictures and videos, and to ensure that activated pictures and videos can be trusted.

KlickZie Product Rollout


· | Phase 1: Build the minimal testable KlickZie system –including the Arknet app and trusted imaging app and the service cloud. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 2: Release the KlickZie system into a limited audience to optimize user experience and user interfaces, to set up the KlickZie cloud for global scale up, and to plan global rollout. 
· | Phase 3: Roll out the KlickZie system of ARks, trusted imaging, and the KLK trading currency, culture by culture and language by language, adding support staff and services as rollout moves forward.

Monetizing

As presently conceived, the KlickZie product aims at revenues from four primary sources:


· | ARk licensing fees paid by ARk-using providers 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Well behaved advertising. 
· | User premium service fees. 
· | Enterprise revenue paid by entities licensing our technologies for enterprise usages.

Funding

We plan to continue raising funds to finance KlickZie product rollout.

Ongoing financing is currently being accomplished by equity sale, by incurring debt, and by other innovative means. There can be no assurances given that any of our funding efforts will be successful.

First KlickZie revenues

Our Plan of Operations for KlickZie based revenue looks for first revenues from ARk business app users coming on line within the first year after the receipt of funding sufficient to round out the KlickZie team. Preparations for other KlickZie revenue are geared for the two year and out timeframe.

Shelved business activity

General app development and digital design activities that were being carried out under our wholly-owned Polybia Studios subsidiary, and our acquisition activities that were being carried out under our Appquisitions Division have been shelved for the time being. Work on our PhotoSweep app has also been shelved in preference to a strict focusing on the KlickZie business activity.

Competition 

With regard to the internet applications in general, competition is intense. According to Statista there are millions of smartphone applications available to users. In spaces that are this crowded the principal matter of competition is about capturing user mind space, which for a given product consists of elements such as degree of product exposure to users, degree of product apparent desirability, pleasure of product usage, and persisting necessity for the product in a user’s life. These elements of competition are well known to our competitors which include the internet giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom have financial resources and operating staffs substantially larger than those of the Company, and all of whom can focus on the optimization of their products towards the same consumer and business arenas upon which we intend to focus.

With regard to the ARknet augmented reality space, while there is no direct competition in the space at the moment, that could change in a heartbeat with an interest taken by any of the internet giants mentioned above.

With regard to KlickZie’s technology for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there are many firms who mark, store and track digital imagery. Among these have been Digimarc, BatchPhoto, and Thirdlight who have marketed such processes for purposes of protecting intellectual property. To our knowledge none of these has turned the smartphone into a generally trustable imager or an advanced image-based communicator as envisioned here. This requires substantially more talent and development activity than required for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery. However, there is nothing stopping any firm, particularly the internet giants, from entering into similar activity. Moreover Truepic, which entered the arena of smartphone trusted imagery, also has patents related to trusted imagery. We have reviewed Truepic’s patent claims and believe that our planned applications do not infringe their claims.

Intangible Properties: issued and pending patents

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our technologies, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success could substantially depend upon our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies and know-how, to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.

We seek patent protection for our technologies. Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents or licenses which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of technology companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology licensing, and the patents which we hold and for which we have applied, do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our technology and patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.

Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages.

As of the date of this annual report, our patent portfolio includes the patents and applications issued by and filed with the USPTO and the purchase technology licensing as described in the following table:
