Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability (meaning that our shareholders have no additional liability, as members of our company, for the liabilities of our company over and above the amount paid for their shares) and formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this Report as a business combination. We have conducted no operations and have generated no revenues to date and we will not generate operating revenues until, at the earliest, after we consummate a business combination.
 
Although we anticipate acquiring a target business that is an operating business, we are not obligated to do so and may determine instead to merge with or acquire a company with no operating history. In such event, investors would not have the benefit of basing the decision on whether to remain with our company following such transaction on the past operations of such target business. Furthermore, in such a situation, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Report may be rendered irrelevant. We can provide no assurances that our management team’s expertise will guarantee a successful business combination. In addition, our management team is not required to devote a significant or certain amount of time to our businesses on a monthly basis and our management team is currently devoting time to, and is involved with, other businesses.
 
Business Strategy
 
We seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our sponsor and management team led by our Chief Executive Officer, Iain Abrahams. We may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region. We intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business. We are not specifically focused on business combinations with companies in which our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates hold interests.
 
Prior to the change of our management team in November 2016, we were focused on industries that complemented our prior management team’s background. We therefore were focused on companies in the media, internet and consumer sector operating in the United Kingdom and Europe (which may have included a business based in Europe which has operations or opportunities outside of Europe). As described below under the heading “Significant Activities Since Inception,” in May 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire a company registered in England and Wales and subsequently terminated such agreement in September 2016 and in May 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a Maryland corporation and subsequently terminated such agreement in October 2017.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.
 
1

 

We seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 

● | have proven business models and attractive growth prospects; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our sponsor and management team, who could assist with, for example, growth strategy, international expansion, and the evaluation and integration of acquisitions; 
● | are focused on U.S. or international expansion where a U.S. listing would complement the broader growth strategy and could be a powerful branding event; 
● | are well positioned to participate in sector consolidation and would benefit from a public acquisition currency; and 
● | would avoid the potentially onerous terms, such as liquidation preferences, that are often characteristic of late state private growth financing rounds. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
Initial Public Offering
 
On May 4, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 7,687,500 ordinary shares, no par value, which included a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 187,500 ordinary shares, pursuant to registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-202235). The ordinary shares were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per ordinary share, generating gross proceeds of $76,875,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 778,438 ordinary shares, issued to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $7,784,380. A total of $80,718,750 of the net proceeds from initial public offering and private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders. The ordinary shares began trading on April 29, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “AAPC”.
 
TLA Agreement
 
On May 3, 2016, we issued an announcement stating that our board of directors and TLA Worldwide plc, a public limited company registered in England and Wales (“TLA”), reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended offer by us for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of TLA. On September 13, 2016, our board determined that it was no longer in the best interests of our shareholders for us to proceed with such offer considering TLA’s withdrawal of its recommendation to its shareholders.
 
Conversion of Loans
 
As of October 19, 2016, we received advances in the aggregate amount of $2,332,000 from certain of our directors (through our sponsor) in order to pay fees owed in connection with our withdrawn offer to acquire TLA in September 2016. Such advances are in addition to an aggregate of $520,000 previously advanced. On November 1, 2016, (i) an aggregate of $1,000,000 of such advances were converted into ordinary shares at a conversion price of $10.00 per share and (ii) an aggregate of $1,852,000 of such advances were converted into ordinary shares at a conversion price of approximately $10.50 per share. In the aggregate, 276,378 ordinary shares were issued to our sponsor in connection with such conversions.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
On November 1, 2016, we held a special meeting in lieu of an annual meeting of shareholders. At such meeting, the shareholders approved the following items:
 

● | an amendment to our memorandum and articles of association (A) extending the date by which we must consummate a business combination from November 4, 2016 to November 3, 2017; and (B) removing the prohibition on our offering to redeem public shares held by our sponsor or its affiliates, directors or officers in connection with the consummation of a business combination; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company (“Continental”) extending the date on which to commence liquidation of our trust account to November 3, 2017; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to direct the election of each of John Service and Daniel Winston as a director, to serve until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected and qualified; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to direct the ratification of the selection by our audit committee of Marcum LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The number of ordinary shares presented for redemption in connection with such meeting was 6,976,958. An aggregate of approximately $73,400,000 (approximately $10.53 per share) was returned to holders of such shares. In addition, an aggregate of approximately $145,000 was distributed to shareholders that voted to approve such extension, which amount is equal to $0.02 for each of the 7,230,088 public shares that were voted to approve such extension.
 
Amendments to Letter Agreements
 
On November 1, 2016, we amended those certain Letter Agreements, dated as of April 28, 2015, by and among us and our sponsor, officers and directors to provide that:
 

● | such insiders shall be entitled to redemption and liquidation rights, as applicable, with respect to any ordinary shares (other than founder shares, private placement shares and shares issued or issuable upon conversion of our debt held by insiders) it holds (i) if we fail to consummate a business combination by November 3, 2017 or (ii) in connection with the consummation of a business combination; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | such insiders shall not have the right to vote any ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of our debt held by such insiders in connection with a business combination. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waiver of Deferred Underwriting Fee
 
On November 1, 2016, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citi”), the representative of the underwriters in connection with our initial public offering, waived its right to receive its deferred underwriting fee, in full, in the amount of $2,690,625, which amount had been held in our trust account pursuant to the underwriting agreement entered into by and between the Company and Citi in connection with our initial public offering.
Kalyx Agreement
 
On May 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Kalyx Development Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Kalyx”). On October 5, 2017, due to the inability to list the securities of the combined entity on any U.S. national stock exchange upon consummation of the merger, which was one of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties elected to abandon the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and enter into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which, the Merger Agreement and related agreements were each terminated, effective immediately, and are no longer of any force or effect.
Final Redemption of Public Shares
 
Due to our inability to consummate a business combination within the time period required by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding ordinary shares that were issued in our initial public offering, at a per-share redemption price of approximately $10.58. As of the close of business on November 3, 2017, such shares were deemed cancelled. The redemption of such shares was completed in November 2017.

Our initial shareholders waived their redemption rights with respect to the outstanding ordinary shares issued prior to our initial public offering, the ordinary shares issued in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering and the ordinary shares issued upon conversion of certain loans.
 
Nasdaq Delisting
 
On March 29, 2017, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that the staff of Nasdaq had determined that the Company did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) (the “Minimum Holders Rule”), which requires the Company to have at least 300 public holders of its ordinary shares for continued listing on Nasdaq. Subsequently, upon the Company’s request, the Nasdaq granted the Company an extension to comply with the Minimum Holders Rule until September 25, 2017.
 
On September 26, 2017, the Company received a written notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq indicating that the Company did not satisfy the terms of the extension and accordingly, the staff of Nasdaq had initiated procedures to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, the trading of our ordinary shares was suspended as of October 5, 2017 and our securities were subsequently removed from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
Amendment of Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles Following Redemption of Public Shares
 
Following the final redemption of our public shares in November 2017, our directors and sole remaining registered shareholder unanimously agreed that rather than commence the winding-up of the Company under the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (as would otherwise be required under the terms of the then memorandum and articles), the Company should instead continue in existence with the intent that it will, at some future time, embark upon a new purpose as approved by the then shareholders and directors. Therefore on April 12, 2018, by resolution of our sole remaining shareholder at the request of our directors, further amendments were made to our memorandum and articles of association for the purpose of removing any obligation to take steps to wind-up the Company following the redemption of the public shares and to remove certain other provisions of the memorandum and articles relating specifically to its original purpose as a listed special purpose acquisition company with a limited life span. 
Business Combination
 
We anticipate structuring our business combination so that the post-transaction company will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review, that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us. We also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
 
Members of our management team directly, or indirectly own ordinary shares and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate a business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to a business combination.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers arising in the future would materially undermine our ability to complete a business combination.
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote, and intend to continue to devote, as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed a business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management devote in any time period will varies based on whether a target business has been selected for a business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
 
Our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world, including in the case of Mr. Abrahams the contacts and relationships he has developed resulting from his involvement in Fox Investments Limited, in the case of Mr. Klein the contacts and relationships he has developed resulting from his involvement in M. Klein & Company, LLC, and in the case of Mr. Mitchell, the contacts and relationships he developed resulting from his involvement with B. Riley Capital Management, LLC (formerly MK Capital Advisors, LLC). This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
Effecting a Business Combination
 
We intend to effectuate a business combination using our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in a business combination. We may seek to complete a business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
5

 

There is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of a business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with a business combination.
 
Sources of Target Businesses and Potential Finder’s Fees
 
Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources as a result of our management’s experience, execution history and ability to deploy capital. These sources include, but are not limited to, investment bankers, private investment funds and other members of our network of business relationships. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. We may engage professional firms or other individuals, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following a business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of a business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after a business combination, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
6

 

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of a business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve a Business Combination
 
While we may submit a business combination to a vote of shareholders (if it is required by law or if we decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons), we may not seek shareholder approval in connection with a business combination as not all the potential ways of structuring a business combinations require shareholder approval under British Virgin Islands law. Since our securities are no longer listed on NASDAQ, we are not subject to NASDAQ rules that would otherwise require us to obtain shareholder approval in connection with our business combination. In addition, because we currently have only one shareholder, no votes other than those cast by our current shareholder are necessary to approve a business combination.
 
Presented below is a table of the types of business combinations we may consider and whether shareholder approval is currently required under British Virgin Islands law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Shareholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we have encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, because we have previously paid cash to our public shareholders who exercised their redemption rights or upon the liquidation of the trust account established at the time of our initial public offering for the benefit of public shareholders, the resources available to us for a business combination have been significantly reduced. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote, and intend to continue to devote, as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed a business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team devotes in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for a business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our ordinary shares are not currently registered under the Exchange Act. However, we are currently voluntarily complying with reporting obligations that apply to public companies, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
As long as we are considered to be a smaller reporting company or maintain our status as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.


We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
