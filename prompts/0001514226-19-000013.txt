ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "we," "our," "us," or "the Company" refer to Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 1, 2010. On July 7, 2010, DynCorp International Inc. ("DynCorp International") completed a merger with Delta Tucker Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 11, 2010, Delta Tucker Sub, Inc. merged with and into DynCorp International, with DynCorp International becoming the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). DynCorp International wholly owns DynCorp International LLC, which functions as the operating company.
The Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have been prepared pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 
Overview 
We are a leading global services provider offering unique, tailored solutions for an ever-changing world. Built on approximately seven decades of experience as a trusted partner to commercial, government and military customers, we provide sophisticated aviation solutions, law enforcement training and support, base and logistics operations, intelligence training, rule of law development, construction management, international development, ground vehicle support, counter-narcotics aviation, platform services and operations and linguist services. 
Our customers include the U.S. DoD, the U.S. Department of State ("DoS"), the U.S. Agency for International Development ("USAID"), foreign governments, commercial customers and certain other U.S. federal, state and local government departments and agencies. Revenue from the U.S. government accounted for approximately 96%, 96% and 95% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our contracts’ revenue and percentage of total revenue from the U.S. government may fluctuate from year to year. These fluctuations can be due to contract length or contract structure, such as with IDIQ type contracts. IDIQ type contracts are often awarded to multiple contractors and provide the opportunity for awarded contractors to bid on task orders issued under the contract. 
Contract Types 
Our contracts are typically structured with an initial base period and multiple option periods. Our contracts typically are awarded for an estimated dollar value based on the forecast of services to be provided under the contract over its maximum life. In addition, we have historically received additional revenue through increases in program scope beyond that of the original contract. These contract modifications typically consist of "over and above" requests derived from changes in customer requirements. The U.S. government is not obligated to exercise options under a contract after the base period. At the time of completion of the contract term of a U.S. government contract, the contract may be re-competed to the extent the service is still required. 
Our contracts with the U.S. government or the government’s prime contractor (to the extent that we are a subcontractor) generally contain standard, unilateral provisions under which the customer may terminate for convenience or default. U.S. government contracts generally also contain provisions that allow the U.S. government to unilaterally suspend us from obtaining new contracts and reduce the value of existing contract spend, pending the resolution of alleged violations of laws or regulations.
Most of our contracts are to provide services, rather than products, to our customers, resulting in the majority of costs being labor related. For this reason, we staff flexibly for each contract. If we lose a contract, we terminate or reassign the employees associated with the contract, hence cutting direct cost and overhead. Generally, elimination of employees would not generate significant separation costs other than those that would be incurred in the normal course of business and would generally be recoverable under applicable contract terms. 
The types of services we perform also support our scalability as our primary capital requirements are working capital, which are variable with our overall revenue stream. The nature of our contracts does not generally require investments in fixed assets, and we do not have significant fixed asset investments tied to a single contract upon which our business materially depends. Additionally, our contract mix gives us a degree of flexibility to deploy assets purchased for certain programs to other programs in cases where the scope of our deliverables changes. 
Our business generally is performed under fixed-price, time-and-materials or cost-reimbursement contracts. Each of these is described below: 

• | Fixed-Price Type Contracts: In a fixed-price contract, the price is generally not subject to adjustment based on costs incurred, which can favorably or adversely impact our profitability depending upon our execution in performing the

 5

contracted service. Our fixed-price contracts may include firm fixed-price, fixed-price with economic adjustment, and fixed-price incentive elements. 

• | Time-and-Materials Type Contracts: Time-and-materials type contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of direct labor hours at fixed hourly/daily rates plus materials at cost.


• | Cost-Reimbursement Type Contracts: Cost-reimbursement type contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract, plus a fixed-fee, award-fee, incentive-fee or a combination thereof. Award-fees or incentive-fees are generally based upon various objective and subjective criteria, such as aircraft mission capability rates and meeting cost targets. Award and incentive fees are excluded from estimated total contract revenue until a reasonably determinable estimate of award and incentive fees can be made.

A single contract may be performed under one or more of the contracts types discussed above. Any of these three types of contracts may be executed under an IDIQ contract, which are often awarded to multiple contractors. An IDIQ contract does not represent a firm order for services. Our Afghanistan Life Support Services ("ALiSS") and LOGCAP IV programs are examples of IDIQ contracts. When a customer wishes to order services under an IDIQ contract, the customer issues a task order request for proposal to the contractor awardees. The contract awardees then submit proposals to the customer and task orders are typically awarded under a best-value approach. However, many IDIQ contracts permit the customer to direct work to a particular contractor.
Our historical contract mix by type, as a percentage of revenue, is indicated in the table below. 

 | For the years ended
Contract Type | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Fixed-Price | 37 | % | | 41 | % | 45 | %
Time-and-Materials | 4 | % | | 5 | % | 4 | %
Cost-Reimbursement | 59 | % | | 54 | % | 51 | %
Totals | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Cost-reimbursement type contracts typically perform at lower margins than other contract types but carry lower risk of loss. We anticipate cost-reimbursement and fixed-price type contracts will continue to represent a majority of our business for calendar year 2019. The contract type indicated in the table above does not necessarily represent fixed or variable consideration under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). 
Under many of our contracts, we may rely on subcontractors to perform all or a portion of the services we are obligated to provide to our customers. We use subcontractors primarily for specialized, technical labor and certain functions such as construction and catering. We often enter into subcontract arrangements in order to meet government requirements that certain categories of services be awarded to small businesses. In some instances, a third party may subcontract with us in support of their prime contract. When we are engaged as a subcontractor in support of a U.S. government contract, standard U.S. government contracting terms typically flow down to our subcontract, providing us with certain protections and obligations.
The following table sets forth our historical role as a prime contractor and subcontractor, as a percentage of revenue.

 | For the years ended
Type | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Prime contractor | 98 | % | | 96 | % | 95 | %
Subcontractor | 2 | % | | 4 | % | 5 | %
Totals | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Operating and Reportable Segments 
In January 2018, the Company amended its organizational structure to improve efficiencies within existing businesses, capitalize on new opportunities, continue international growth and expand commercial business. The Company’s three previous operating and reporting segments, Aviation Engineering, Logistics, and Sustainment ("AELS"), Aviation Operations and Life Cycle Management ("AOLC") and DynLogistics, were re-aligned into two operating and reporting segments by combining AELS and AOLC into DynAviation with DynLogistics continuing to operate as a separate segment. Our two segments provide services domestically and internationally primarily under contracts with the U.S. government and operate principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”), Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) and audits by various U.S. federal agencies. See Note 12 to the Delta Tucker

Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of segments.
A description of each of our Reportable Segments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 is discussed further below. 
DynAviation
This segment provides aircraft operations and logistics services to include modernization and refurbishments, upgrades and sustainment, and maintenance and support for key military, government and commercial customers worldwide. DynAviation also provides the technical information and expertise to manage large fleets and bases and delivers engineering and maintenance services to help keep operations running effectively. The Theater Aviation Sustainment Manager - OCONUS ("TASM-O") and Contractor Logistics Support: T-34, T-44, T-6 ("CLS T34/44/6") programs are two of the most significant programs in the DynAviation segment. The TASM-O program provides aviation maintenance services under the Army Aviation Field Maintenance ("AFM") program. Our CLS T34/44/6 program provides maintenance and logistics support to the U.S. Navy T-34, T-44, and T-6 aircraft. The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation ("INL Air Wing") and T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply ("T-6 COMBS") Bridge contracts, which were both completed during the first three quarters of calendar year 2018, also contributed significantly during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
DynLogistics
This segment provides best-value mission readiness to its customers through total support solutions including conventional and contingency logistics, operations and maintenance support, platform modification and upgrades, supply chain management and training, security and full spectrum intelligence mission support services. DynLogistics supports U.S. foreign policy and international development priorities by assisting in the development of stable and democratic governments, implementing anti-corruption initiatives and aiding the growth of democratic public and civil institutions. This segment also provides base operations support, engineering, supply and logistics, pre-positioned war reserve materiels, facilities, marine maintenance services, program management services primarily for ground vehicles and contingency response on a worldwide basis. These services are provided to U.S. government agencies in both domestic and foreign locations, foreign government entities and commercial customers. 
The LOGCAP IV and ALiSS contracts are significant contracts within this segment. Under the LOGCAP IV program, which we perform under a single IDIQ contract, the U.S. Army contracts for us to perform selected services, operations and maintenance, engineering as well as construction and logistics predominately in the Middle East Theater to augment the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces and to release military units from combat service support missions or to fill the U.S. military resource shortfalls. Under the ALiSS contract, the Company provides the DoS’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs with life support services for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, including the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and other U.S. government sites within the country.

Key Contracts
Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV ("LOGCAP IV"): The LOGCAP IV contract was awarded to us in April 2008 and is a part of our DynLogistics segment. We were selected as one of the three prime contractors to provide logistics support under the LOGCAP IV contract. LOGCAP IV is the U.S. Army component of the DoD’s initiative to award contracts to U.S. companies with a broad range of logistics capabilities to support U.S. and allied forces during combat, peacekeeping, humanitarian and training operations. This IDIQ contract has an initial term of up to ten years, and was subsequently extended in June 2018 by twelve months to April 2019. In December 2012, customer negotiations resulted in the elimination of the award fee component for option years beginning in 2012 and continuing for the remaining contract periods. The remaining task orders under the LOGCAP IV contract are now either firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursable-plus-fixed-fee.
Theater Aviation Sustainment Manager - OCONUS ("TASM-O"): The TASM-O contract is a part of our DynAviation segment. This contract was awarded in September 2013 to provide aviation maintenance services under the AFM program.

The IDIQ contract has a one-year base period with four, one-year option periods and is a hybrid firm-fixed-price, cost-plus fixed fee, and cost reimbursable contract. While ALiSS technically ended in December 2018, the contract has task orders with a period of performance extending beyond December 2018, including task orders with options for performance through August 2023.
Naval Test Wing Atlantic: The Naval Test Wing Atlantic contract is a part of our DynAviation segment and is the follow-on program from the Naval Test Wing Patuxent River MD contract awarded to us in July 2011. The Naval Test Wing Atlantic contract commenced in April 2017 to provide organization level maintenance and logistic support on all aircraft and support equipment for which the Naval Test Wing Atlantic has maintenance responsibility. Labor and services will be provided to perform safety studies, off-site aircraft safety and spill containment patrols and aircraft recovery services. The contract has a one-year base period and four one-year option periods and is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a smaller portion of fixed-price services.

The contract has a one-year base period and four one-year option periods and is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a smaller portion of fixed-price services.
Estimated Total Contract Value and Certain Other Terms 
The estimated total contract value represents amounts expected to be realized from the initial award date to the current contract end date (i.e., revenue recognized to date plus backlog). For the reasons stated under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Business - Key Contracts," the estimated total contract value or ceiling value specified under a government contract or task order is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. 
Key Contracts 
The following table sets forth certain information for our principal contracts, including the initial start and end dates and the principal customer for each contract as of December 31, 2018: 

Contract | Segment | Principal Customer | Initial/Current Contract Start Date | Contract End Date | Estimated Total Contract Value (1)
LOGCAP IV (2) | DynLogistics | U.S. Army | Apr-2008 | Apr-2019 (3) | $7.63 billion 
TASM-O | DynAviation | U.S. Army | Sep-2013 | June-2019 (4) | $837 million 
CLS Transport | DynAviation | U.S. Navy | Jun-2017 | May-2023 | $782 million 
CLS T34/44/6 | DynAviation | U.S. Navy | Nov-2014 | Sep-2019 | $743 million 
ALiSS | DynLogistics | DoS | Jan-2015 | Aug-2023 (6) | $609 million 
Naval Test Wing Atlantic | DynAviation | U.S. Navy | Apr-2017 | Mar-2022 | $553 million 
WRM III | DynLogistics | U.S. Air Force | May-2000 / Jun-2008 / Feb-2017 | Sep-2024 | $504 million 
Andrews AFB | DynAviation | U.S. Air Force | Sep-2011 | Apr-2019 (5) | $467 million 
ANP | DynLogistics | U.S. Army | Dec-2014 | March-2019 | $285 million 
Naval Test Wing Pacific | DynAviation | U.S. Navy | Nov-2017 | Oct-2022 | $278 million 


(1) | Estimated total contract value represents the start and end date of the contracts as modified and is not necessarily representative of the amount of work we will actually experience under the contract. With the exception of contract ceiling maximums, contract values can continue to increase or decrease over time based on contract modifications, extensions or placement of orders under IDIQ contracts.


(2) | LOGCAP IV has a $5 billion ceiling per year per contractor over 10 years.


(3) | While LOGCAP IV technically ended in April 2018, we received a 12-month task order extending the period of performance to April 2019. The extension will allow us to continue to serve our customer on this important program until LOGCAP V is awarded. We believe we are well positioned to be an awardee under LOGCAP V.


(4) | While TASM-O technically ended in December 2018, we received a six-month contract award extending the period of performance to June 2019.


(5) | While Andrews AFB technically ended in December 2018, we received a four-month contract award in December 2018 extending the period of performance to April 2019. In August 2018, we received the General Services Administration ("GSA") task order to provide executive airlift aircraft maintenance and back shop support services in support of the 89th Airlift Wing and in December 2018, we were awarded the 811th Rotary Wing Service contract, both located at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.


(6) | While ALiSS technically ended in December 2018, we received task orders under the ALiSS contract with a period of performance extending beyond December 2018, including task orders with options for performance through August 2023.

Completion of Key Contract
The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation ("INL Air Wing") program supported governments in multiple Latin American countries and provided support and assistance with interdiction services in Afghanistan and provided intra-theater transportation services for DoS personnel throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. The INL Air Wing program was completed in calendar year 2018. 
Competition 
We compete with various entities across geographic and business lines based on a number of factors, including services offered, experience, price, geographic reach and mobility. Most activities in which we engage are highly competitive and require that we have highly skilled and experienced technical personnel to compete. Some of our competitors may possess greater financial and other resources or may be better positioned to compete for certain contract opportunities. 
 9

We believe that our principal competitors include AAR CORP, AECOM, Akima LLC, Alutiiq LLC, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Boeing Company, Chugach Government Solutions, Elbit Systems of America, Emcor Group, Inc., Fluor Corporation, General Dynamics, IAP Worldwide Services, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle, Inc., KBRwyle, Leidos, Leonardo DRS, Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky Inc., M1 Support Services, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), PKL Services, Inc., Vectrus, Vertex Aerospace, and Yulista. We believe that the primary competitive factors for our services include reputation, technical skills, past contract performance, experience in the industry (including our aircraft platform experience), cost competitiveness and customer relationships.
 10

Backlog 
We track backlog in order to assess our current business development effectiveness and to assist us in forecasting our future business needs and financial performance. Our backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts under contracts and does not include contracts under protest. Funded backlog is equal to the amounts actually appropriated by a customer for payment of goods and services less actual revenue recognized as of the measurement date under that appropriation. Unfunded backlog is the actual dollar value of unexercised, priced contract options and the unfunded portion of exercised contract options. These priced options may or may not be exercised at the sole discretion of the customer. Unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ or other master agreement contract vehicles.
Firm funding for our contracts is usually made for one year at a time, with the remainder of the contract period consisting of a series of one-year options. As is the case with the base period of our U.S. government contracts, option periods are subject to the availability of funding for contract performance. Most of our U.S. government contracts allow the customer the option to extend the period of performance of a contract for a period of one or more years. 
The following table sets forth our approximate backlog as of the dates indicated:

 | December 31, 2018
(Amounts in millions) | DynAviation | | DynLogistics | | Total
Funded backlog | $ | 460 | | | $ | 445 | | $ | 905 
Unfunded backlog | 1,965 | | | 1,182 | | | 3,147
Total backlog | $ | 2,425 | | | $ | 1,627 | | $ | 4,052
 | December 31, 2017
(Amounts in millions) | DynAviation | | DynLogistics | | Total
Funded backlog | $ | 585 | | | $ | 383 | | $ | 968 
Unfunded backlog | 2,030 | | | 1,171 | | | 3,201
Total backlog | $ | 2,615 | | | $ | 1,554 | | $ | 4,169

The decrease in backlog as of December 31, 2018 was primarily due to revenue outpacing orders during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. government may cancel certain contracts through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Certain commercial or non-U.S. government contracts may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel prior the completion of the contract, however, most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed.
Regulatory Matters 
Contracts with the U.S. government are subject to a multitude of regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the FAR and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement ("DFARS"), which set forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government. Under U.S. government regulations certain costs, including certain financing costs, lobbying expenses, certain types of legal expenses and certain marketing expenses related to the preparation of bids and proposals are not allowed for pricing purposes and calculation of contract reimbursement rates under cost-reimbursement contracts. The U.S. government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs may be allocated to U.S. government contracts. 
Our international operations and investments are subject to U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control laws and regulations, the False Claims Act and other export laws and regulations. We must also comply with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. government regulation, including import-export control, investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings, the UK Bribery Act, European Union compliance regulations and requirements to expend a portion of program funds in-country. 
Our U.S. government contracts are subject to audits at various points in the contracting process. Pre-award audits are performed at the time a proposal is submitted to the U.S. government for cost-reimbursement contracts. The purpose of a pre-award audit is to determine the basis of the bid and provide the information required for the U.S. government to negotiate the contract effectively. In addition, the U.S. government may perform a pre-award audit to determine our capability to perform under a contract. During the performance of a contract, the U.S. government has the right to examine our costs incurred on the contract, including labor charges, material purchases and overhead charges. Upon a contract's completion, the U.S. government performs an incurred cost 
 11

audit of all aspects of contract performance for cost-reimbursement contracts to ensure that we have performed the contract in a manner consistent with our proposal and FAR. The U.S. government also may perform a post-award audit for proposals that are subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act to determine if the cost proposed and negotiated was accurate, current and complete as of the time of negotiations. 
The Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA") performs these audits on behalf of the U.S. government. The DCAA also reviews and opines on the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including Accounting, Purchasing, Property, Estimating, Earned Value Management and Material Management Systems. The DCAA has the right to perform audits on our incurred costs on all flexibly-priced contracts on an annual basis. We have DCAA auditors on-site to monitor our billing and back office operations. An adverse finding under a DCAA audit could result in a recommendation of disallowed costs under a U.S. government contract, termination of U.S. government contracts, forfeiture of profits, withholding of payments, fines, suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In the event that an audit by the DCAA recommends disallowance of our costs under a contract, we have the right to appeal the findings of the audit under applicable dispute resolution provisions. Approval of submitted annual incurred costs claims can take many years. All of our incurred costs claims for U.S. government contracts completed through fiscal year 2014 have been audited by the DCAA and negotiated by the Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA"). Incurred cost claim audits for subsequent periods are ongoing except for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, which questioned $7.4 million of costs and resulted in a unilateral decision regarding our indirect rates. The largest portion of the unilateral decision has been appealed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals ("ASBCA") and, at this time, we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this case is remote. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - A negative audit or other actions by the U.S. government could adversely affect our operating performance." 
At any given time, many of our contracts are under review by the DCAA and other government agencies. We cannot predict the outcome of such ongoing audits and what, if any, impact such audits may have on our future operating performance. 
U.S. government contractors, including our Company, operate in an environment of significant oversight by the DCAA and other U.S. government agencies. If any of our internal control systems are determined to be non-compliant or inadequate, payments may be suspended under our contracts or we may be subjected to increased government oversight that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on our contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. 
Sales and Marketing 
We provide our service solutions to a wide array of customers, primarily multiple departments and agencies within the U.S. government, as well as select international customers and commercial customers. We also provide our services to other prime contractors who have contracts with the U.S. government and other international customers where our capabilities help to deliver comprehensive solutions. We position our business development and marketing professionals to cover key accounts such as the DoS and the DoD, as well as other international and commercial market segments which hold the most promise for aggressive growth and profitability.
We participate in national and international tradeshows, particularly as they apply to aviation services, logistics, contingency support, defense, diplomacy and development markets. We are also an active member in several organizations related to services contracting, such as the Professional Services Council. 
As a global service solutions provider, we have unique experience and capability in providing value-added and full spectrum services to government agencies and selected partners worldwide.
Our business development and marketing professionals maintain close relationships with all existing customers while continuing to aggressively pursue adjacent markets to maximize growth opportunities. 
Intellectual Property 
We hold an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid license to use the "Dyn International" and "DynCorp International" names in connection with aviation services, security services, technical services and marine services. We also own various licenses for names associated with Phoenix, Casals and Heliworks. Additionally, we own various registered domain names, patents, trademarks and copyrights. Since most of our business involves providing services to government entities, our operations generally are not substantially dependent upon obtaining and/or maintaining copyright, patents, or trademark protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them. 
Environmental Matters 
Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of petroleum products and other hazardous materials, including services such as painting aircraft and handling substances that may qualify as hazardous waste, such as used batteries and petroleum products. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations by which we must abide. These regulations relate to the protection of the environment, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous 
 12

substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors and visitors. We have written procedures in place and compliance programs related to environmental matters. 
 13
