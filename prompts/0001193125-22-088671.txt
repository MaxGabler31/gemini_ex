  KORE enables mission-critical applications for over 3,600 customers comprising over 14 million devices. KORE is a leader in enabling end-to-end IoT solutions for enterprises across high growth end markets including Connected Health, Industrial IoT, Fleet Management and Remote Asset Monitoring. KORE serves an expansive group of some of the largest blue-chip enterprises with low customer concentration (approximately 300 customers comprising approximately 89% and 87% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively). 
 KORE’s customers operate in a wide variety of sectors, including healthcare, fleet and vehicle management, asset management, communication services and industrial/manufacturing. KORE’s largest customer, comprising approximately 21% and 16% of KORE’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is a large multinational medical device and health care company. 
 KORE has a B2B (business to business) model where any given customer may have hundreds, or thousands of devices deployed in the field. The structure of KORE’s relationships with its connectivity customers is “sticky,” meaning that any exit by a connectivity customer from KORE’s platform generally will take place over an extended period of time. Additionally, it may not be clear to KORE that a customer is exiting. 
 The difficulty in determining if a customer is moving away from KORE is compounded by the fact that the number of Total Connections that KORE has with any particular customer can increase or decrease over time depending on a variety of factors, including pricing, customer satisfaction and fit with a particular customer product. In some cases, customers may choose to allocate a portion of their business to other service providers alongside KORE. This allocation can change from period to period. As a result, a decline in Total Connections by a customer is not necessarily an indicator that the customer has decided to move away from KORE. Customers often keep their volume allocation decisions confidential in order to prevent KORE from making commercial adjustments (such as price increases). 
 Key Partners 
 KORE’s strong customer and partner relationships provide it with the opportunity to expand its market reach and sales. KORE partners with leading cellular providers to enable its CaaS business. KORE’s IoT ecosystem partners include enterprise-level IoT software providers as application platform partners, top of the line commercial hardware manufacturers as hardware OEM partners, well-known electronics solutions providers as semi-conductor and module OEM partners, globally recognized cloud platforms as cloud providers as well as multinational system integrators as systems integration services partners. These partnerships allow KORE to provide IoT Solutions to its customers.

IoT Connectivity 
 KORE’s heritage is in delivering IoT Connectivity services, particularly cellular connectivity, which is needed in a large number of IoT use cases. Managing cellular connectivity for IoT devices is complex. Companies deploying IoT devices often do so in multiple countries and sometimes across multiple continents. Even within an individual country, it is often the case that no single carrier offers 100% network coverage or coverage across all cellular technologies. Among other 
 
8 

  IoT deployment complexities, this lack of a single carrier across territories often necessitates negotiating, establishing and maintaining a large number of cellular carrier contracts. On a day-to-day level this requires potentially accessing a large number of cellular carrier portals in order to provision, de-provision, maintain, change rate plans for, change states for, and perform other transactions for SIMs deployed in IoT devices. A company deploying IoT would also expect to get multiple cellular carrier bills every month, and to work with multiple customer support organizations when something goes wrong. This complexity is very hard to manage at scale, especially since it is only a part of the complexity of the overall IoT deployment. KORE’s connectivity services simplify this complexity and provide a single connectivity relationship managed through a single source with our KORE One platform which is purpose built for IoT. On the back-end, KORE leverages 44 carrier integrations with its cellular carrier partners. 
 KORE IoT Connectivity Services Coverage 
 
KORE also believes that eSIMs and eUICC technology have significant potential for IoT providers and for KORE in particular. eSIM and eUICC technology are new standards for remote SIM provisioning defined by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (“GSMA”), the organization that supports and defines cellular standards. The transition from the current standard, where a SIM is “locked in” to a specific cellular carrier, to an “unlocked” eSIM model with eUICC technology that allows a company deploying IoT to switch cellular carriers at the push of a button, “over the air,” without the need to physically change SIM cards, will allow a provider in KORE’s position to offer a single eSIM that works across multiple cellular carriers. This evolution will provide KORE clients the ability to easily switch cellular carriers, without the need for expensive and labor-intensive physical SIM replacements. 
 Within IoT Connectivity services, KORE offers CaaS and CEaaS. 
 CaaS is cellular connectivity via KORE’s IoT platform ‘KORE One’™ and it is offered to enterprise customers such as large medical device manufacturers, or to IoT software and solutions providers such as fleet tracking companies who may bundle connectivity with their own software and solutions. Fees for CaaS services generally consist of a monthly subscription fee for each connection, and additional data usage fees. Connectivity services also include charges for each SIM sold to a customer and other miscellaneous charges. 
 CEaaS is provided to communication service providers (such as MVNOs, and telecom carriers), device OEMs or other providers who wish to provide IoT cellular services to the market. The infrastructure software and services offered to such providers are cellular Core Network as a Service (including Cloud Native Evolved Packet Core “EPC”), or “CNaaS”), Connectivity Management Platform as a Service (“CMPaaS”) and Private Networking as a Service (“PNaaS”). Fees for CEaaS generally consist of a monthly subscription fee and other miscellaneous charges. 
 IoT Connectivity services represent 68% and 74% of KORE’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any entities covered by HIPAA (including entities such as KORE which track health-related data) are required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule to protect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure of patient health information known as protected health information. HIPAA also requires that covered entities comply with the HIPAA Security Rule which requires, among other things that, all covered entities (i) ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information; (ii) detect and safeguard against anticipated threats to the security of the information; (iii) protect against anticipated impermissible uses or disclosures; and (iv) certify compliance by their workforce.
