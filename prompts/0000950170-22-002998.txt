Company Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for neuronal excitability disorders to address unmet needs in chronic pain, psychiatry, epilepsy and other disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems. These disorders often occur when neurons are overly excited or inhibited, leading to an imbalance, and our focus is on restoring homeostasis. We are developing a pipeline of clinically differentiated product candidates focused on validated mechanisms of action with broad therapeutic potential to deliver improved therapeutics for patients with these disorders.
 Our two lead clinical-stage candidates are ETX-810 and ETX-155. ETX-810 is a novel palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) prodrug initially being developed for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) and lumbosacral radicular pain (LSRP, commonly referred to as sciatica). ETX-810 is being evaluated in two Phase 2a clinical trials that are expected to report topline data in 2022 (DPNP Phase 2a in the first half of 2022, and LSRP Phase 2a in the second half of 2022). ETX-155 is a neurosteroid GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) initially being developed for major depressive disorder (MDD), perimenopausal depression (PMD) and focal onset seizures (FOS), the most common type of seizure in people with epilepsy. In the first half of 2022, assuming U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of our investigational new drug (IND) application filed in the first quarter of 2022, we plan to initiate two Phase 2a clinical trials for ETX-155 in patients with MDD and PMD, and we expect both to report topline data in the second half of 2023. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with photosensitive epilepsy that is expected to report interim data in the first half of 2022.
 We focus on the development of product candidates whose mechanisms of action have been clinically validated. By clinically validated, we mean there are product candidates with these mechanisms of action that have demonstrated statistical significance on efficacy endpoints in published randomized, controlled clinical trials. We leverage the deep expertise of our team to generate new chemical entities (NCEs) based on these clinically validated mechanisms of action that we believe have the potential to be clinically differentiated and enhance patient outcomes. Through this approach, we have established a robust pipeline with two clinical product candidates and two preclinical programs, each with the potential to address multiple disorders. Our product candidates are focused on addressing neuronal excitability disorders with large, well-defined markets, where clinical and regulatory endpoints are clearly established and development pathways are precedented, yet current therapies leave patients with efficacy, safety or tolerability challenges. Our strategy is to initially pursue indications for each of our product candidates where the clinical translatability of the mechanism of action has been well established and, upon demonstrating clinical proof of concept, evaluate additional indications to maximize the value of each program. We believe these principles favorably position us to bring novel therapeutics to patients living with challenging disorders while maximizing our probability of clinical development, regulatory and commercial success.
 Our lead investigational program, ETX-810, is a novel, oral, NCE prodrug of PEA in clinical development for chronic pain conditions. Despite a large global prescription drug market for chronic pain therapeutics, it has been shown that less than half of patients achieve a 50 percent reduction in their pain intensity with current first line therapies. In addition to suboptimal efficacy, current therapies are often hindered by dose-limiting side effects such as dizziness, sedation, cognitive impairments, gastrointestinal disturbances and concerns over abuse liability. Despite these issues, drugs to treat chronic pain, such as Lyrica and Cymbalta, have achieved significant commercial success and have been among the top-selling pharmaceutical products globally.
 The PEA pathway, which is believed to play an important role in the regulation of neuroinflammation and pain signaling, represents a promising potential mechanism to treat multiple conditions of chronic pain. PEA is an endogenous bioactive lipid that has been evaluated in dietary supplement formulations in relation to various pain conditions in more than 30 clinical studies, with over 2,500 patients, including patients with LSRP and DPNP, treated with dietary supplement PEA in these studies. Fifteen of these studies were randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) in a total of approximately 1,500 patients, with thirteen RCTs demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain reduction endpoints. A peer-reviewed meta-analysis of eight RCTs conducted with PEA demonstrated a weighted mean reduction in pain intensity score (based on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)) of approximately two points compared to control, which compares favorably to the reductions in pain intensity reported from clinical trials with currently approved chronic pain medications. In addition, few adverse events related to PEA treatment have been reported in these published clinical studies. Despite this promising precedent clinical data supporting the exploration of the potential utility of PEA in chronic pain treatment, there are no PEA-based therapeutics approved by the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or similar regulatory authority. Rather, PEA is only currently available as a dietary supplement (nutraceutical), which has shown low bioavailability and overall poor drug-like properties.


As a prodrug of PEA, ETX-810 was designed to significantly improve the absorption and systemic exposure of PEA beyond what is achievable with currently available formulations, potentially maximizing the therapeutic effect. In our Phase 1 SAD and MAD clinical trials of ETX-810, which included a total of 80 healthy volunteers, ETX-810 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability. ETX-810 also demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics in a group of healthy subjects relative to dietary supplement formulations of PEA, with approximately three times higher PEA exposure on a matched dose basis. We believe the optimized pharmacokinetics and favorable tolerability of ETX-810, combined with our development and manufacturing expertise, put us in position to progress a robust clinical development program and explore the full therapeutic effect of ETX-810. To date, we have not observed any clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with ETX-810, and due to PEA’s endogenous nature, we believe there is a low potential for liabilities related to addiction or abuse, positioning ETX-810 to potentially be used as a differentiated monotherapy or in combination with other medications for chronic pain. If approved, ETX-810 may be the first PEA-based therapeutic addressing the critical unmet need in chronic pain treatment for novel, non-opioid and non-addictive therapeutic options. We believe a significant commercial opportunity exists for a new chronic pain agent with proven efficacy and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 We have initiated two separate Phase 2a clinical trials of ETX-810 in the United States, one in patients with DPNP and another in patients with LSRP, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ETX-810 in these indications. We expect to report topline data from our DPNP Phase 2a trial in the first half of 2022, and from the LSRP Phase 2a trial in the second half of 2022. If these trials are successful, we plan to conduct further studies with a view to broaden ETX-810’s clinical applications in peripheral neuropathic and other chronic pain conditions.
 Our second clinical program, ETX-155, is an investigational, oral, neuroactive steroid NCE that is designed to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) and that we are planning to evaluate in patients with depression and epilepsy. MDD affects approximately 35 million adults globally and approximately 19 million adults in the United States and causes significant impairment to daily life. While there are effective therapies available for individuals suffering from MDD, there is considerable variability in patient responsiveness resulting in only about one-third of patients benefiting from their first line therapy. There is a pressing need for safe, well-tolerated and rapidly acting antidepressants that reliably provide clinical improvement faster than the up to six weeks associated with standard of care selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Epilepsy affects approximately 4.7 million people in the major markets of the United States, Europe, and Japan, with approximately 1 million of these patients experiencing uncontrolled focal onset seizures (FOS) that are refractory to multiple anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Despite the existence of over 30 approved ASMs, approximately 30% of epilepsy patients fail to achieve adequate seizure control. FOS has a high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities like depression, which can be exacerbated by many of the currently prescribed ASMs. There is a pressing need for new ASMs to not only reduce the number of seizures but to also provide a positive effect on mood. The GABAA PAM therapeutic class has been clinically validated in certain depression and epilepsy indications, and we believe there is a clear opportunity for clinical differentiation.
 ETX-155 was designed to have dual potency at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. ETX-155 has also shown differentiated pharmacokinetic properties, including no clinically meaningful food effect and an approximate 40-hour half-life to enable once-a-day dosing. Results from our 7-day and 14-day Phase 1 repeat dose clinical trials demonstrated favorable tolerability data at exposure levels that are consistent with dosing levels that achieved robust activity in preclinical models of depression, anxiety and epilepsy. Based on our preclinical and clinical work to date, we plan to pursue clinical trials in FOS, MDD and PMD. In the second half of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1b photosensitive epilepsy trial, which if successful, would support initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in FOS. We plan to announce interim data from the photosensitive epilepsy trial in the first half of 2022. In addition, assuming FDA clearance of our IND filed in the first quarter of 2022 with the psychiatry division, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MDD in the first half of 2022 and expect to report topline data in the second half of 2023. We also intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to support clinical efficacy in patients with PMD in the first half of 2022, assuming FDA clearance of our IND, and expect to report topline data in the second half of 2023.
 In addition to our clinical candidates, we are progressing a preclinical pipeline with two programs currently in discovery stage. Our preclinical programs apply our medicinal chemistry and biology expertise combined with our in-depth understanding of drug discovery and development processes to develop novel product candidates based on clinically validated mechanisms of action.


Our lead preclinical program is a Kv7.2/3 potassium channel opener. Kv7.2/3 has been clinically validated as a therapeutic target for both epilepsy and pain. The first generation Kv7 channel opener, ezogabine (Potiga), was approved for refractory focal onset seizures in 2011 in both the United States and in Europe (where it was known as retigabine, or Trobalt). Flupirtine (Katadolon) was another first generation Kv7.2/3 opener that provided clinical validation and was used in Europe as a treatment for pain. These molecules showed clinical efficacy but subsequently had to be withdrawn from the market due to safety issues. We are developing an NCE that harnesses the efficacy of the Kv7.2/3 channel mechanism while attempting to improve the safety and tolerability relative to earlier molecules, based on our insights into the mechanisms of toxicity. We expect to initiate IND-enabling studies for this program in 2022.
Our second preclinical program is focused on developing a novel, potent analog of an earlier approved 2,3-benzodiazepine for the potential treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The aim of our program is to develop a rapidly acting, non-sedating, non-addictive anxiolytic that does not impair motor or cognitive performance, does not have any adverse drug-drug interactions, and has the potential to be dosed once a day. We plan to progress preclinical development activities for this program in 2022.
 We own the rights to our product candidates through both acquisitions and internal research and development efforts. With respect to ETX-810, in February 2019 we acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) related to the ETX-810 program from Carnot, LLC. With respect to ETX-155, in October 2020, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Athenen Therapeutics, Inc., which included IPR&D related to the ETX-155 program. Following these acquisitions, we have continued the in-house clinical-stage development of the ETX-155 and ETX-810 programs. Our preclinical Kv7 and GAD programs have been developed by us.
 Below is a summary of our wholly owned pipeline.
 
Figure 1. Eliem Therapeutics’ pipeline of product candidates.
 Our Approach
 We follow several key principles to guide our research and development efforts that we believe will enable us to efficiently bring clinically differentiated therapies to market to help millions of people suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders:
 •Focus on clinically validated mechanisms of action. We concentrate our research and development efforts on opportunities within the broad range of neuronal excitability disorders, where there has been prior clinical validation for the mechanism of action or pathway and where significant unmet need exists due to efficacy and safety limitations of existing therapies. By focusing on products with mechanisms of action that have clinical validation, we believe we can reduce the clinical translational risk of our product candidates while leveraging our extensive neuroscience drug development expertise to develop products that have the potential to meaningfully improve clinical outcomes.


•Establish clinical differentiation for our product candidates. We leverage the deep chemistry, neuroscience and manufacturing expertise of our team to generate NCEs which we believe can be clinically differentiated and enhance patient outcomes. We intend to improve on efficacy, safety and tolerability limitations of existing therapies that impact patient convenience, compliance and outcomes. We aim to deliver therapeutic candidates with optimal pharmacological properties that make them both clinically differentiated and commercially attractive.
 •Pursue CNS indications with well-defined regulatory pathways in large markets that are inadequately served by current therapies. The initial indications we are pursuing for ETX-810 and ETX-155 are chronic pain, depression and epilepsy, all of which have well-characterized, large patient populations and are insufficiently addressed by existing therapies. In these indications, clinical endpoints and regulatory pathways are well-defined and precedented.
 •Develop products that have broad therapeutic potential. We believe that the biological pathways that are involved in many neuronal excitability disorders are related, and therefore, therapies that effectively address these pathways may be applicable in multiple CNS disorders. Our strategy for each product candidate is to initially pursue tractable indications where the clinical translatability of the mechanism of action has been validated. Upon positive results from proof-of-concept trials, we intend to pursue additional indications where we believe our product candidates’ mechanisms may be relevant, to maximize the potential for each product candidate.
 •Maximize and protect value through a strong global intellectual property portfolio. We have a rigorous strategy to establish and protect the intellectual property rights for our programs, all of which are wholly owned, to allow us to maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline. This strategy includes seeking patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions for our product candidates, each of which is an NCE. Our portfolio includes numerous filings with multiple different sets of claims that cover proprietary aspects of our lead programs and their use. For ETX-810 and ETX-155, we have issued patents in the United States with coverage to at least 2037 and 2039, respectively, as well as a wide variety of pending applications for these programs in the United States and elsewhere. We continue to leverage new discoveries in the development of these programs to strengthen the breadth and depth of our intellectual property.
 Our Strategy
 To execute our approach, we plan to implement the following key strategies:
 •Advance ETX-810 through clinical trials for DPNP and LSRP and progress toward commercialization. ETX-810 represents a compelling opportunity to develop a novel molecule for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, with a mechanism of action supported by a robust body of precedent clinical research across multiple pain settings. We have completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trial for ETX-810 in healthy volunteers and are currently executing two randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trials aimed at establishing clear proof-of-concept for ETX-810 in DPNP and LSRP. We intend to announce topline data from both Phase 2a clinical trials in 2022. With positive results from these trials, we intend to progress development of ETX-810 into later-stage trials in the United States and other countries to support filings for regulatory approval in key markets.
 •Advance ETX-155 through clinical trials in both depression and epilepsy indications and progress toward commercialization. ETX-155 is a potentially differentiated GABAA PAM candidate with dual potency at synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors, an approximate 40-hour half-life and no clinically meaningful food effect. We have completed a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial for ETX-155 in healthy volunteers, and assuming FDA clearance of our IND, we plan to initiate Phase 2a clinical trials in both MDD and PMD in the first half of 2022. In addition, we are evaluating ETX-155 in a Phase 1b photosensitive epilepsy proof-of-concept trial with an interim data readout expected in the first half of 2022. Assuming the results of this trial are positive, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with focal onset seizures in the first half of 2023. With positive results from these trials, we intend to progress development of ETX-155 into later-stage trials in the United States and other countries to support applications for regulatory approval in key markets.
 •Continue to innovate and advance our preclinical programs into clinical trials in multiple neuronal excitability indications. We are currently developing two preclinical-stage programs: (1) a novel Kv7.2/3 channel opener for potential treatment of pain, epilepsy, and depression; and (2) a novel 2,3-benzodiazepine anxiolytic for the potential treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Both preclinical programs are based on clinically validated mechanisms of action with prior approved molecules in the class. Our aim is to discover and develop proprietary NCEs that improve upon first-generation molecules based on our novel chemical insights and in-depth understanding of the biology and selectivity required to yield drugs with favorable safety and efficacy profiles. We anticipate commencing IND-enabling studies for our Kv7.2/3 program in 2022, and continuing to progress preclinical development of our next-generation anxiolytic in 2022.


•Apply our expertise to expand our lead programs into additional indications representing large markets. Our team includes established industry leaders in the fields of neuroscience and pain. Through our clinical trials, we intend to enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action for our specific product candidates, and in general our understanding of the biological pathways leading to neuronal inhibition and excitation imbalances to maximize the value of our product candidates. Utilizing this enhanced understanding informed by our initial clinical trials, we plan to evaluate additional potential indications for both ETX-810 and ETX-155. For ETX-810, we will explore additional pain indications, which could enable a broad label in peripheral neuropathic pain and chronic pain. For ETX-155, we intend to explore a wide-range of compelling opportunities in both psychiatry and neurology, including potentially generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder.
 •Pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize them in key markets. We plan to build a fully integrated biotechnology company capable of executing registrational trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing our drugs globally. We expect to build a focused and efficient medical affairs and commercial organization to help bring our product candidates to patients around the world. Given the potential broad applicability of our product candidates in large patient populations globally, we may also opportunistically enter strategic partnerships with reputable biopharmaceutical companies, with established presence in key geographies, to address the unmet needs of patients worldwide and maximize the overall value of our product candidates.
 Our Team
Since commencing operations in 2019, we have assembled a seasoned management team with expertise in neuroscience research and development, medicinal chemistry, clinical development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization. Our team includes industry veterans with leadership experience at leading biopharmaceutical companies such as Amgen, Biogen, GSK, Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer, as well as at successful small biotechnology companies such as Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Convergence Pharmaceuticals, Cavion, Exelixis and Juno Therapeutics. In addition, our team has collectively driven development and operational efforts supporting the approval of multiple drugs in chronic pain, depression and epilepsy, including Aptiom, Geodon, Lamictal, Lyrica, Neurontin, Trobalt and Vyepti. Our leadership team’s track record of success enables us to continue to recruit highly experienced personnel. Our board of directors is comprised of industry leaders with senior leadership experience at large pharmaceutical organizations and public and private biotechnology companies, bringing significant expertise across neuroscience research and development, corporate governance, finance, organizational strategy and capital raising. Together, we bring years of experience combined with the resilience needed to confront challenging diseases of the nervous system.
 ETX-810
 We are developing ETX-810, a novel prodrug of PEA, as a treatment for patients suffering from chronic pain. PEA, the active moiety of ETX-810, is an endogenous bioactive lipid known to broadly modulate neuroinflammation and pain signaling. Dietary supplement PEA has shown activity in more than 30 clinical studies across a variety of pain indications, including demonstrating statistically significant reductions in pain in 13 randomized, controlled trials, along with favorable tolerability data. However, there are no FDA or EMA approved PEA-based therapeutics, as no agent has ever been taken through a rigorous clinical development program with a view to obtain regulatory approval. In addition, the only currently available versions of PEA are dietary supplement formulations that, while demonstrating promising clinical activity and tolerability in prior studies, have low bioavailability and overall poor drug-like properties.
 ETX-810 was designed to significantly improve the systemic exposure of PEA to explore its full therapeutic potential and to significantly reduce chronic pain. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ETX-810 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability data with all adverse events (AEs) being mild and transient. We believe the endogenous nature of PEA makes ETX-810 unlikely to have drug-drug interactions and limits the potential for abuse liability. We are currently conducting Phase 2a clinical trials of ETX-810 in two chronic pain indications: DPNP and LSRP.


Overview of Chronic Pain and the Unmet Need
 Chronic pain is one of the most common and complex conditions in the world and continues to be poorly addressed by available therapeutic options. In the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study, pain and pain-related conditions were confirmed to be the leading cause of disability and disease burden globally, and this burden is escalating. In patients who are receiving a first line agent for chronic pain, currently approved medications, including Lyrica and Cymbalta, have demonstrated pain intensity reductions of 50% or more in less than 50% of patients. In addition to inadequate efficacy, the current standard of care is hindered by dose-limiting side effects, including dizziness, sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as concerns over the abuse liability of the opioid class of pain treatments. These limitations of currently approved therapies ultimately lead treating physicians to resort to polypharmacy, prescribing a combination of multiple drugs at once. Despite a massive global chronic pain prescription therapeutics market, there is a high unmet need for safe, effective, non-opioid therapies to treat chronic pain. We believe a significant commercial opportunity exists for a new chronic pain agent with proven efficacy and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 PEA Proposed Mechanism of Action in Neuroinflammation and Chronic Pain
 PEA is an endogenous bioactive lipid that was first described in 1957, but its mechanism of action remained unclear until the 1990s, when the work of Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini was published describing PEA as part of a class of endogenous regulatory molecules called N-acylethanolamines, which control mast cell activation in vivo. Systemically administered N-acylethanolamines were found to be effective in reducing mast cell degranulation and therefore have anti-inflammatory effects. Subsequent preclinical studies have since evaluated these powerful anti-inflammatory effects and revealed analgesic effects of PEA. Evidence demonstrated that PEA acts as a modulator of neuroinflammatory processes. In pathological settings such as chronic pain conditions, PEA production may be insufficient to regulate the inflammatory cascade that downstream drives an increase in pain signaling, and exogenous administration of PEA might prove therapeutically beneficial.
 As described in Figure 2 below, PEA’s mechanism is considered pleiotropic, as literature supports that it acts through a series of direct and indirect actions involving several effector cells and molecular targets. It is believed that PEA plays a key role as a master regulator of neuroinflammatory processes, triggering multiple signaling cascades to control downstream pain signaling and elicit its potent analgesic effect.
 
Figure 2. Potential pleiotropic mechanism of action of endogenous PEA for the control of neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability, and therefore downstream pain signaling.


We believe there are multiple aspects of PEA’s potential pleiotropic mechanism that remain to be elucidated, but several potentially important mechanisms that have been published include:
 1.Inhibition of mast-cell activation and degranulation and downregulation of release of inflammatory mediators from multiple immune cell types;
 2.Agonism of the nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha, leading to regulation of expression of several genes, including an inhibition of pro-inflammatory genes;
 3.Agonism of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR55, potentially playing a role in microglial cell migration, activation and increased phagocytosis; and
 4.An “entourage effect” where PEA increases the level of other endocannabinoids with potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, such as 2-AG, anandamide, and OEA, by acting as a substrate for FAAH.
 Figure 3 describes our current understanding of how fluctuations in PEA levels may lead to dysregulation of neuroinflammation and pain signaling. In chronic pain (center panel), evidence demonstrated that there may be both a decrease in PEA synthesis and an increase in PEA metabolism leading to a net decrease in PEA below the level needed to maintain control of neuroinflammation. As a result, sensitization in both the peripheral and central nervous system lead to an increase of pain signaling and pain sensation, relative to a healthy physiological state (left panel of Figure 3). ETX-810 is designed to deliver exogenous PEA and restore PEA to levels needed to reduce neuroinflammation and restore a healthy physiological state, where hyperexcitability of the pain signaling network is dampened and chronic pain is reduced (right panel of Figure 3).
 
Figure 3. The potential role of PEA in controlling neuroinflammation and pain in normal physiology versus chronic pain states, and therapeutic hypothesis. ETX-810 provides an exogenous source of PEA aimed at rebalancing the body’s PEA levels that have been reduced due to an imbalance between synthesis and metabolism of endogenous PEA.


In addition to the preclinical evidence of a decreased level of PEA in chronic pain, a clinical publication further supports the finding in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients showing significantly lower PEA levels in the synovial fluid compared to healthy volunteer control subjects. This data is depicted in Figure 4 below:

Clinical Experience with PEA in Pain
 The pain-relieving properties of PEA in human diseases associated with chronic pain have been evaluated in multiple clinical studies since the 1990s using PEA in dietary supplement formulations. Over 30 clinical studies, including fifteen randomized, placebo-controlled studies, have been conducted with these dietary supplement formulations across multiple pain indications. Statistically significant reductions in pain intensity were observed in nearly all of these studies with PEA treatment. These studies reported few dropouts and few reported AEs, suggesting that PEA was generally well tolerated. A summary of the fifteen published randomized controlled clinical studies conducted with PEA in various pain conditions, including the PEA dose levels evaluated, is below:
 

Meta-analyses demonstrated PEA’s consistent therapeutic effects
 Two meta-analyses have examined the effects of PEA on pain across clinical studies. The most recent meta-analysis of eight randomized, controlled studies by Artukoglu and colleagues in 2017 included a total of 743 patients receiving PEA and 460 inactive controls. Doses used in these trials ranged from 300 to 1200 mg/day and trial durations from 15-180 days. The meta-analysis demonstrated that PEA was associated with a significantly greater pain reduction based on VAS scores compared to control conditions, with a weighted mean reduction in pain score on a 10-point scale of 2.03 (95% CI: 1.19-2.87). A summary of these results is below in Figure 5:
 
Figure 5. Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of PEA in a dietary supplement formulation. Adapted from Artukoglu et al. Pain Physician, 2017;20:353-362.
 The weighted mean difference in pain score for PEA vs inactive control of 2.03 from this meta-analysis compares favorably to the standardized mean difference in pain score from meta-analyses conducted on randomized trials of pregabalin and duloxetine, as shown in Figure 6 below:

PEA’s dose-dependent therapeutic effect and impact on neuropathic pain in clinical studies
 We believe the most compelling clinical data for PEA in pain come from a multicenter, randomized controlled study that enrolled a total of 636 subjects across nine sites with compressive-type lumbar sciatica who were treated with either 300 or 600 mg dietary supplement PEA (Normast, Epitech) per day, or placebo, for 21 days. The reduction in pain intensity was assessed based on VAS score, and the improvement in health status of patients was evaluated by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). A dose-dependent effect on both VAS and RMDQ scores was observed. The effect size was statistically significant (p <0.001) on both VAS score (change versus baseline pain scores of 5.0 on 600 mg, 2.9 on 300 mg and 2.0 on placebo) and RMDQ score (change versus baseline of 9.2 on 600 mg, 5.0 on 300 mg and 3.0 on placebo).
 Cruccu et al. performed a post-hoc analysis from the raw data associated with the aforementioned study, which was published in 2019. In this analysis additional measures of the clinical efficacy, such as 50% responder rate (VAS pain scores and disability RMDQ scores) and number needed to treat were conducted. In the 600 mg PEA cohort, 82% of patients achieved a 50% or greater reduction in pain intensity as measured by the VAS, as compared to 33% of patients in the 300 mg cohort and 22% of patients in the placebo group. Of patients in the 600 mg PEA cohort, 88% achieved a 50% or greater improvement in physical disability as measured by RMDQ, as compared to 38% in the 300 mg cohort and 23% of patients in the placebo group. In addition, the authors calculated the Numbers-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) to be 1.7 for the 600 mg dose (NNT in this case is defined as the number of patients needed to treat to find one patient who achieves a 50% reduction in pain intensity). This compared very favorably to the NNT of pregabalin and duloxetine published in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in neuropathic pain, where the NNT for 50% pain relief for these drugs was calculated to be 7.7 and 6.4, respectively. Across all measures, 600 mg PEA performed better than 300 mg, suggesting a dose-dependent response and supporting our prodrug approach to increase PEA exposures. These results are summarized in Figure 7 below:
 
Figure 7. Results of a post-hoc analysis of the largest PEA clinical trial conducted to date: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial by Guida et al. in 636 patients with chronic low back pain. Figure adapted from Cruccu et al. CNS & Neurological Disorders – Drug Targets, 2019;18(6):491
 In addition, Cruccu et al. developed an ordinal scale to categorize each patient’s pain into 5 different groups based on increasing probability of the pain being neuropathic. A significant positive correlation was found between an improvement in pain score and an increasing probability of the pain being neuropathic in nature. This, together with the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of action, further supports the hypothesis of using PEA in patients with neuropathic pain.


Another clinical study of PEA as a dietary supplement in osteoarthritis was published by Steels et al. in 2019. In this single site, randomized, controlled study, 111 subjects with osteoarthritis in one or both knees were randomized to receive either 300 mg PEA (n=36), 600 mg PEA (n=35), or matched placebo capsules (n=40), daily for 8 weeks. All participants were required to have a minimum pain level of 4 on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and were not allowed to take any pain concomitant therapies while on study other than paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a rescue therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), which measures pain, stiffness and function. The secondary endpoint was pain intensity measured by the NRS pain scale. All 3 components of the WOMAC score were statistically significantly reduced for both 300 mg and 600 mg PEA groups compared to placebo at week 8. In addition, there was an apparent dose-dependent effect as the 600 mg PEA dose outperformed the 300 mg PEA dose across all metrics evaluated, although the study was not powered to show statistical significance between these two dose levels (Figure 8). There were no SAEs reported in any of the study participants.

 Both the Guida and Steels studies suggest that an increase in PEA dose may lead to a potential additional clinical benefit in terms of pain reduction, supporting our hypothesis for development of ETX-810 delivering around 3-fold higher PEA exposure than PEA itself (dietary supplement formulation, Normast).
 Limitations of PEA pharmacokinetics and our solution
 Despite PEA’s evaluation in pain indications in numerous clinical trials, there is minimal information available on the pharmacokinetic profile of dietary supplement PEA formulations in humans. Given its lipidic nature and large particle size, PEA in its native state is expected to have limitations in terms of solubility, absorption and bioavailability. While micronized and ultra-micronized nutraceutical formulations of PEA have aimed to improve the bioavailability compared to the native state by reducing the particle size, we are not aware of any published data demonstrating definitive improvement in bioavailability or other pharmacokinetic parameters in humans.
 We believe the dose-dependent clinical efficacy and limited number of treatment-related adverse events in precedent clinical studies of PEA in chronic pain provides compelling evidence of the therapeutic potential of PEA. We also believe this supports our approach to develop ETX-810 as an NCE PEA prodrug with desirable pharmacokinetics to explore the full therapeutic potential in patients with chronic pain.


We believe that, if approved by the FDA, ETX-810 may have regulatory and commercial advantages over dietary supplement formulations of PEA, as a PEA-based prescription medicine with regulatory approval for use in the treatment of certain chronic pain indications. We believe these advantages are important differentiating features and considerations for patients and physicians as they evaluate potential treatments. These potential advantages for any FDA approved prescription PEA drug could include:
 •Rigorous regulatory review of NDA including FDA benefit-risk assessment and review of data from clinical studies and chemistry manufacturing and controls information, evaluating safety and effectiveness for use in chronic pain indications.
 •Ability to provide prescribers with a package insert including robust details on clinical results in the specific patient populations (such as DPNP and LSRP) studied in our clinical studies including efficacy, safety, recommended dosing, pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and any potential drug-to-drug interactions.
 •Ability to market with claims regarding treatment effect on certain chronic pain indications, to the extent permitted under an FDA-approved label.
 •Obligations to manufacture, assure quality control and distribute in accordance with pharmaceutical cGMP requirements.
 •Potential for coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors.
 ETX-810 Competitive Advantages
 We believe that ETX-810 offers several key differentiating features compared to currently available therapies for chronic pain.
 •Novel approach to chronic pain with demonstrated clinical proof of concept. ETX-810 is believed to be the only PEA prodrug in clinical development and is being developed based on precedent clinical studies of dietary supplement formulations of PEA that demonstrated clinically meaningful statistically significant reductions in pain intensity in over 12 randomized placebo clinical trials. These trials collectively included approximately 1,500 patients spanning multiple inflammatory and neuropathic chronic pain conditions. In one study of over 600 chronic low back pain patients, PEA demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain versus placebo including a greater than 50% reduction in pain intensity in 82% of patients. Published studies suggest that first line agents for chronic pain, such as the currently approved medications Lyrica and Cymbalta, are able to provide substantial pain relief (a reduction in pain score of 50% or more) in less than 50% of patients. Building upon the strength of these clinical data, we believe ETX-810 has the potential to be the first PEA-based therapeutic to address the unmet need in the large chronic pain market, although cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable predictors of the relative efficacy or other benefits that ETX-810 may have compared to other product candidates that may be approved or that are in development.
 •Designed for desirable pharmacokinetics. Commercially available formulations of PEA are currently only available as dietary supplements and have low bioavailability with overall poor drug-like properties, likely leading to suboptimal exposures. ETX-810 was designed to significantly improve the systemic exposure of PEA in order to maximize the therapeutic effect. ETX-810 was observed, in preclinical studies, to be rapidly absorbed after oral administration and to undergo enzymatic hydrolysis during absorption and in plasma to efficiently release high concentrations of free PEA. In clinical studies in a small number (80) of healthy volunteers, ETX-810 has demonstrated rapid absorption and efficient release of biologically active PEA, resulting in approximately three times higher PEA exposure on a matched dose basis compared to a commercially available dietary supplement formulation of PEA, as well as an approximately three to six times longer half-life compared to the published estimated half-life of PEA in rats. Precedent clinical data has demonstrated a clear dose response with respect to PEA’s ability to reduce pain intensity in chronic pain settings, which we believe supports our approach to optimize the pharmacokinetic exposure of PEA with ETX-810.
 •Well tolerated and no known abuse liability in clinical studies. Phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose clinical trials with ETX-810 suggest the potential for an encouraging tolerability profile, and clinical trials conducted to date have resulted in no SAEs, no discontinuations, and no clinically meaningful differences from placebo. These findings are consistent with published results from clinical trials conducted with dietary supplement formulations of PEA. In contrast, existing chronic pain therapies are associated with a range of dose-limiting adverse effects including GI problems, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, somnolence and others. In addition, as an endogenous bioactive lipid, the potential for abuse is considered to be low, potentially addressing the critical unmet need in chronic pain treatment for novel, non-opioid and non-addictive therapeutic options. Prior clinical studies of PEA have no reported adverse events related to abuse.


•Potential to be used in chronic pain as a monotherapy or in combination with other analgesics. In multiple prior clinical trials with dietary supplement formulations of PEA, a reduction in pain intensity was observed with PEA in chronic pain both as a monotherapy and when used in combination with other pain therapies such as opioids, antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Because polypharmacy is a common treatment strategy used by clinicians treating chronic pain, the market is in need of therapies that can safely and effectively be used in combination with others. We believe the favorable tolerability data in clinical trials and the endogenous nature of PEA make ETX-810 unlikely to have drug-to-drug interactions and position it for the potential to be used in combination with other chronic pain medications, if approved.
 Chronic Pain Indication Overview
 Chronic pain, generally described as pain lasting more than three to six months, is one of the most common and complex conditions. It is estimated to affect approximately 20% of adults in the United States and Europe. Despite the high prevalence worldwide, there are few approved medicines to treat chronic pain and the existing therapeutic options suffer from limited efficacy coupled with a range of adverse effects which can limit their utility, reduce compliance and complicate their ability to combine with other drugs. The two initial chronic pain indications we plan to pursue for ETX-810 are pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPNP) and lumbosacral radicular pain (LSRP).
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)
 DPN is a common, late manifestation of diabetes characterized by damage to the sensory and autonomic nervous system caused by prolonged poor glycemic control and increased levels of triglycerides in the blood. Neuropathic pain is associated with DPN, leading to an exaggerated response to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) and pain evoked by light contact, such as those with shoes or clothing (allodynia). This pain can lead to interference with daily activities, disability, psychosocial impairment and reduced health-related quality of life. While DPN can be managed to slow further progression, its symptoms, including chronic neuropathic pain, are generally not reversible once they emerge. There are significant direct and indirect costs associated with the effects of DPN, with approximately one quarter of health expenditure in diabetes spent on management of DPN.
 It is estimated that 30% to 50% of people with diabetes will experience diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and 40-50% of those with DPN will experience DPNP. This provides a prevalence estimate of approximately 5.0 million to 7.0 million DPNP patients in the United States and 9.0 million to 12.0 million in Europe. Of treated DPNP patients it is estimated that 50% to 70% have an inadequate response to first line therapy, leading to an estimated 1.5 million to 3.0 million treatment-refractory DPNP patients in the United States and approximately 2.7 million to 5.0 million DPNP patients in Europe.
 There are currently several pharmacological treatments recommended for the first-line treatment (both approved and off-label), to reduce pain and improve quality of life in DPNP patients, including several antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline and other tricyclic drugs) and gabapentinoid anti-seizure medications (e.g., pregabalin and gabapentins). Available evidence suggests that all of these treatments are better than placebo in improving DPNP, but few high-quality comparative trials have been carried out, and there are only three products approved by the FDA and EMA for DPNP: duloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica) and the opioid tapentadol (Nucynta). For patients with an inadequate response to first line therapy, second line therapy generally consists of switching to a different first-line medication class or combining multiple first-line agents (polypharmacy), though this can be complicated by the risk of compounding adverse effects. Opioids are recommended to help manage pain in DPNP only after all other first/second-line approaches and combinations fail.
 DPNP remains an unmet need and is a primary driver of physical and psychological comorbidity. Available therapies for DPNP have moderate efficacy with adverse effects limiting optimal dose titration. In registrational studies of pregabalin and duloxetine, only 40% to 50% of patients achieved a clinically meaningful response of a 50% improvement in pain from baseline, with roughly one quarter of these patients reporting dizziness or nausea adverse events. There is a considerable need for new therapies for the management of DPNP that provide improved efficacy with a more favorable tolerability and safety profile.
 We believe that ETX-810, if approved, could potentially be positioned as the preferred second-line monotherapy or add-on agent for the 50% to 70% of DPNP patients who fail to achieve adequate pain relief from generic first-line treatment options, potentially providing improved efficacy versus alternative options and preventing unnecessary opioid usage in this patient group. This represents a target patient population of approximately 4 million to 8 million patients in the United States and Europe.


Lumbosacral Radicular Pain (LSRP)
 LSRP is a neuropathic pain syndrome caused by compression, inflammation and or injury of spinal nerve roots in the lower back and is characterized by lower back pain that radiates into the leg in predictable patterns. The leg pain is typically much worse than the lower back pain and is described as being electric, burning or sharp. Additionally, affected people may experience numbness, muscle weakness and loss of specific reflexes. The most common cause of LSRP is nerve root compression caused by a disc herniation or spondylosis (narrowing of the intraspinal canal, the lateral recess, or the neural foramen) due to degenerative arthritis affecting the spine. While LSRP can occur at any age, it often effects men beginning in their 40s and women in their 50s and 60s.
 Multiple sources suggest that between 3% and 5% of the adult population is affected by the condition, with equal rates among men and women, which corresponds to approximately 10 million to 16 million people in the United States and 15 million to 26 million people in Europe. Approximately 30% of these patients see their condition progress to chronic, with pain progressing past the three-month mark.
 For patients diagnosed with LSRP, the aim of treatment is to alleviate the pain, and if necessary, address the underlying cause of nerve irritation/compression. Patients are initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen and modification to physical activity. For patients with continued pain after approximately six to eight weeks of NSAID or acetaminophen treatment, some patients obtain epidural steroid injections, which has been demonstrated to provide short-term pain relief. Patients failing to achieve adequate pain relief may be prescribed gabapentinoids, such as Neurontin and Lyrica. Studies with gabapentinoids in LSRP have demonstrated varying results and a recent meta-analysis found that these agents do not provide effective treatment and are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Additionally, opioids are used in patients who have severe pain. Many physicians, however, oppose opioid use in LSRP as there is a lack of high-quality data supporting their use for this condition. Furthermore, the use of opioids is associated with adverse events and the potential for abuse.
 Due to the limited efficacy and potential side effects of current treatments, there continues to be a need for effective, non-opioid therapies for the treatment of LSRP. We believe that ETX-810 could potentially be positioned as the preferred second line monotherapy or add-on agent over epidural steroid injections or opioids in those patients who fail to achieve adequate relief with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. This represents an estimated target patient population of approximately 7.5 million to 12.5 million LSRP patients in the United States and Europe.
 ETX-810 Clinical Development
 We have evaluated the safety and tolerability of ETX-810 in 68 individuals across two completed Phase 1 clinical trials. ETX-810 was well tolerated and all AEs were mild and transient. We are currently enrolling proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical trials in patients with DPNP and LSRP.
 Phase 1 SAD and MAD Clinical Trials in Healthy Volunteers
 The first clinical trial conducted with ETX-810 was a combined single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial in healthy volunteers. Fifty subjects in the SAD portion of the trial received single doses of either placebo or ETX-810 ranging from 50 mg to 1200 mg and 20 subjects in the MAD portion received repeated doses of either placebo or ETX-810 at 500 mg and 1000 mg administered twice daily for seven days.
 The SAD portion of this trial enrolled five cohorts of 10 participants, who each received single doses of ETX-810 ranging from 50 mg to 1200 mg; participants were randomized 4:1 ETX-810 to placebo. All cohorts were dosed in a fed state except the 50 mg and 150 mg fasted cohorts. The participants in the 150 mg cohort were dosed in both a fed and a fasted state, 5 days apart, to assess the effect of food on absorption.
 There were no clinically significant changes nor trends across dose groups seen in vital signs, ECG, blood chemistry, hematology, nor urinalysis; a single adverse event (AE) (headache) required treatment (ibuprofen). There was no difference in the incidence of AEs among dose groups and no trends toward an increase in incidence with increasing dose. With respect to pharmacokinetics, ETX-810 was found to convert rapidly to its hydrolysis intermediates and to PEA and was found to be more completely absorbed when administered with food. The results of the SAD portion of the trial justified the selection of 500 mg and 1000 mg as the doses for the MAD portion of the trial.


The MAD portion of this trial enrolled two cohorts with 10 participants in each. In each cohort, eight participants were administered active investigational product and two were administered a placebo twice daily for six days with a single dose administered on Day 7. Participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received 500 mg and 1000 mg ETX-810, respectively, or placebo following food. The interval between the two daily doses was 12 hours.
 Treatment was well tolerated; there were no clinically significant changes nor trends across dose groups seen in vital signs, ECG, blood chemistry, hematology, nor urinalysis. No AEs required treatment or led to interruption or discontinuation of treatment. A single AE (insomnia) was rated moderate; all others were mild. There was no difference in the incidence of AEs among groups, and no trend to an increase in incidence with increasing dose. Figure 9 describes the percentage of subjects with adverse events from the ETX-810 SAD and MAD portions of the trial.
 
Figure 9. Percent of subjects reporting adverse events in the ETX-810 Phase 1 study, 011810-101, in the (a) SAD portion of the trial and (b) MAD portion of the trial.
 Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Clinical Trial Evaluating a 500 mg Single-capsule Formulation and Effect of Food
 A 500 mg single-capsule formulation was developed to reduce capsule burden. With this formulation, we conducted a second Phase 1 clinical trial (Study 018810-102) evaluating the pharmacokinetics of two dose levels with and without food. Each of the 12 participants received two dose levels of ETX-810 (500 and 1000 mg) with and without food separated by 24 hours in this randomized 4-way crossover. Treatment was well tolerated with adverse events reported consistent with the prior SAD and MAD clinical trials.
 In this trial the administration of ETX-810 with food was found to significantly increase the AUC0-24h values for the metabolic intermediates and the active metabolite PEA. ETX-810 concentrations were below measurable quantities at all time points, indicating rapid conversion to its metabolites upon administration. Cmax for these metabolites was not found to be increased when ETX-810 was administered with food compared to the fasted state. Based on these results and the SAD and MAD trials, in future trials ETX-810 will be dosed with food.
 Potential Improvement in PEA Exposure from ETX-810 vs Dietary Supplement PEA
 We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate a commercially available ultramicronized dietary supplement formulation of PEA in a small number (8) of healthy volunteers in order to establish well-controlled pharmacokinetics to provide a baseline for comparison to ETX-810, given the lack of availability of high-quality human pharmacokinetic data for PEA.
 This trial evaluated a single dose of 300 mg or 600 mg of a dietary supplement formulation of PEA (Normast) in eight subjects, with 300 mg tested in both a fasted and a fed state and 600 mg tested only in a fed state, in each case after a five-day washout period between doses. Blood samples were taken prior to and up to 12 hours after each dose. Prior to dosing, endogenous PEA concentrations averaged approximately 4-7 ng/mL and were consistent within and between subjects across dosing periods.


The administration of dietary supplement PEA increased PEA concentrations in all participants at all dosing periods, but with high subject-to-subject variability, particularly with respect to Cmax and Tmax. Administration of the 300 mg dose after a meal resulted in greater increases in PEA than did administrations in the fasted state, with approximately 2-fold higher AUC0-12h and 3-fold higher Cmax.
 The plot provided below highlights the comparison of PEA exposure (AUC0-12h) between a single 1000 mg dose of ETX-810 from Study 018810-102 compared to the 600 mg dose of dietary supplement PEA, from Study 018875-101, both in the fed state. Although this comparison was not based on a head-to-head study, a single 1000 mg dose of ETX-810 prodrug (which delivers ~490 mg of PEA) achieved approximately three-fold higher PEA exposure than a 600 mg dose of dietary supplement PEA, which has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain in multiple clinical studies. We believe the increased exposure is potentially driven by improved oral bioavailability, rapid absorption and a longer half-life of PEA when delivered via the ETX-810 prodrug.
 
Figure 10. Comparison of exposure of PEA from ETX-810 compared to an ultramicronized dietary supplement formulation of PEA from two different clinical studies. ETX-810 data was taken from the 1000 mg fed cohort of the ETX-810 018810-102 PK trial. Ultramicronized PEA data was taken from the 600 mg fed cohort of the 018875-101 PK trial of dietary supplement PEA. Each 1000 mg capsule of ETX-810 corresponds to ~490 mg of PEA active ingredient.
 In our ongoing Phase 2a clinical trials, we are dosing 1000 mg ETX-810 bis in die (BID, twice daily) with food, meaning in these trials we are theoretically achieving approximately six times the daily exposure as would be expected from the standard clinical dose (i.e., 600 mg/day) of PEA from dietary supplements. Based on the dose response observed with dietary supplement formulations of PEA in multiple prior studies, we believe that the increased exposure provided by ETX-810 provides us with the possibility to evaluate the full potential therapeutic effect of PEA in chronic pain indications.
 ETX-810 is rapidly absorbed and undergoes a series of hydrolysis steps to be converted into the active moiety PEA. Studies have shown that ETX-810 did not have any potential for either direct or time-dependent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. Because the majority of metabolism of PEA occurs through esterases and lipases, and not through CYPs, there is little to no potential for drug-drug interactions. PEA is further degraded by N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) and to a lesser extent by fatty acid amid hydrolase (FAAH) into palmitic acid and ethanolamine. We believe this supports ETX-810’s potential as a monotherapy or in combination with other pain drugs.


Phase 2a Clinical Trials
 Based on the extensive clinical data on the efficacy of dietary supplement PEA and the findings on tolerability and exposure of our PEA prodrug, ETX-810, observed in our Phase 1 SAD/MAD and pharmacokinetic (PK) trials, we initiated Phase 2a clinical trials in two chronic pain conditions: DPNP and LSRP. Our clinical development team has significant experience designing and running clinical trials in chronic pain, allowing us to implement strategies that attempt to limit the patient-to-patient variability and placebo effect commonly observed in chronic pain studies.
 Phase 2a DPNP clinical trial
 This Phase 2a clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ETX-810 in adults with DPNP. Patients are instructed to take their study drug, either 1000 mg of ETX-810 or placebo, twice per day, approximately twelve hours apart, with food. The primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline to week 4 in the weekly average of the daily pain score on the 11-point PI-NRS. Secondary endpoints include percent of patients with 50% and 30% reduction from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the weekly average of the daily pain score.
 A trial schema of the Phase 2a DPNP clinical trial is provided below:
 
Figure 11. ETX-810 Phase 2a DPNP trial schema
 A total of 167 subjects have been randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the ETX-810 or placebo treatment group. An estimated sample size of 81 subjects per treatment group will provide 80% power to detect a 1.0-point change in the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in the weekly average daily pain score on the PI-NRS, with an assumed standard deviation of 2.2, based on previously published studies and clinical experience.
 We have fully enrolled this clinical trial, completed dosing and expect to have a topline data readout during the first half of 2022.
 Phase 2a LSRP clinical trial
 This Phase 2a clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ETX-810 in adults with LSRP. Patients are instructed to take their study drug, either 1000 mg of ETX-810 or placebo, twice per day, approximately twelve hours apart, with food. The primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline to week four in the weekly average of the daily pain score on the 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS). Secondary endpoints include percent of patients with greater than 50% and 30% reduction from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the weekly average of the daily pain score.


A trial schema of the Phase 2a LSRP clinical trial is provided below:
 
Figure 12. ETX-810 Phase 2a LSRP trial schema
 A total of 122 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the ETX-810 or placebo treatment group. A sample size of 61 subjects per treatment group will provide 80% power to detect a 1.0-point change in the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in the weekly average daily pain score on the pain intensity (PI)-NRS, with an assumed standard deviation of 1.9, based on previously published studies and clinical experience.
 We are actively enrolling LSRP patients into this clinical trial and expect to fully enroll this study in the first half of 2022 and have a topline data readout during the second half of 2022.
 Future Clinical Trials for ETX-810
 Based on the results of our Phase 2a clinical trials, we intend to consult with the FDA about future Phase 2b/3 clinical trials. Our current plan is to initiate a Phase 2b dose-range finding trial in DPNP in the second half of 2022 and potentially a second Phase 2b dose-range finding trial in LSRP in the first half of 2023, pending results of the Phase 2a studies and discussion with the FDA. Beyond these initial indications, through careful consideration of our clinical data, the market and competitive landscape, and correspondence with the FDA, we plan to evaluate other opportunities to potentially expand development of ETX-810, which could enable a broad label in peripheral neuropathic pain and chronic pain. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1 study in healthy human subjects evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of two additional high-strength formulations aimed at further optimizing the ETX-810 drug product.
 ETX-155
 We are developing ETX-155, a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, or GABAA PAM, for the treatment of patients suffering from MDD, PMD and FOS. The GABAA PAM class has been clinically validated in both depression and epilepsy indications by a variety of different agents in the class. ETX-155 was designed to have broad potency across both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptor subtypes. ETX-155 has also shown desirable pharmacokinetic properties, including no clinically meaningful food effect and an approximate 40-hour half-life to enable once-a-day-dosing, positioning it favorably within the GABAA PAM therapeutic class. We believe ETX-155’s potent activity across GABAA receptor subtypes and efficacy in preclinical models of epilepsy, depression, and anxiety supports its application in multiple therapeutic settings. We have initiated a Phase 1b photosensitive epilepsy trial, which if successful, would support initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in FOS. We plan to announce interim data from the photosensitive epilepsy trial in the first half of 2022. In addition, in the first half of 2022, assuming FDA clearance of our IND filed in the first quarter of 2022 with the psychiatry division, we intend to initiate both a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with MDD and a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with PMD, and we expect both trials to report topline data in the second half of 2023.


GABAA Receptor as a Therapeutic Target for Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders
 Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Neuronal signaling by GABA via the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) plays a critical role in a wide range of processes within the CNS. Modulation of the GABAARs via small molecules has been a highly active area of research since their initial discovery in the 1960s. GABAAR is a clinically validated target, with multiple classes of GABAAR-targeted drugs on the market, including benzodiazepines, anesthetics, anticonvulsants, neuroactive steroids (neurosteroids) and barbiturates.
 GABAARs are ligand-gated chloride channels with a pentameric structure composed of α, ß, g and d subunits in a 2:2:1 stoichiometry. GABA-induced chloride influx mediated through GABAARs leads to hyperpolarization of neurons, preventing action potentials and dampening down neuronal excitability. There are six α, three b, two g and d subunits (also rare e, q and p subunits) that assemble to form 19 GABAAR subtypes. The subunit structures, abundance, distribution and drug binding regions of GABAARs are summarized below.
 
Figure 13. Mechanism of action of neurosteroid positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Neurosteroid PAMs can bind to and activate both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors via an allosteric site distinct from the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. This potentiates the action of both phasic and tonic inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABAA receptors, leading to decreased neuronal excitability. ETX-155 is an investigational neurosteroid with dual potency at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors.
 GABAA Structure and Properties:
 •19 GABAA subtypes are differentially expressed in the brain with distinct regional and cellular distribution dependent on subunit compositions
 •Of the 19 subtypes, α1 GABAARs are the most abundant (60%), with α2 and α3 less abundant (10-20%) and α4 and α5 GABAARs the least abundant (~5%)
 •α1ßg2, α2ßg2 and α3ßg2 subtypes are expressed predominantly in synapses while α4 and α5 GABAARs are primarily extrasynaptic
 •The d subunit preferentially pairs with α4, α6 and ß2/3 subunits and these GABAARs are also expressed at extrasynaptic sites
 •Benzodiazepines act only on synaptic receptors, inducing short term effects
 •Neurosteroids bind to a distinct site on both g and d GABAARs and regulate both synaptic and extrasynaptic neuron functions


The GABAARs are typically clustered opposite GABA-releasing neuronal terminals. The synaptic α1ßg2, α2ßg2 and α3ßg2 subtypes mediate rapid phasic inhibition of nerve action potentials. The extrasynaptic α4, α6 and ß2/3 and d subunit-containing GABAARs mediate tonic inhibition, potentially generating a more powerful and broader modulation of cortical neural-network activity that is relevant in multiple CNS disease states and disorders.
 Positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs, are substances that bind to a receptor at a distinct site from the primary endogenous ligand and enhance the receptor’s response to the ligand. GABAA PAMs act by enhancing endogenous GABA’s activity at these receptors. Allopregnanolone is an endogenous GABAAPAM and fluctuations in allopregnanolone levels are associated with the pathophysiology of mood, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Exogenous neuroactive steroids (neurosteroids) are an emerging class of PAMs with potential for treating complex CNS disorders. ZULRESSO (brexanolone/exogenous allopregnanolone; Sage Therapeutics, Inc.) was approved in 2019 for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). Other neurosteroid molecules in clinical development include zuranolone (SAGE-217; Sage Therapeutics, Inc.) for PPD and MDD, ganaxolone (Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc) for rare epilepsies and PRAX-114 (Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc.) in MDD. CVL-865 (Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc.) is also a GABAA PAM in clinical development for epilepsy, but unlike the neurosteroids, CVL-865 binds to the benzodiazepine site of synaptic α2/3/5 GABAAR subtypes. The clinical data generated from these candidates suggest that a GABAA receptor PAM may have potential therapeutic effect in depression and epilepsy. However, pharmacokinetic properties and/or tolerability concerns leave an opportunity for clinical differentiation with ETX-155.
 ETX-155 and its Competitive Advantages
 ETX-155 is a neurosteroid GABAA PAM NCE designed to have broad potency at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (EC50’s of 95 – 330 nM). In preclinical studies, ETX-155 showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and potent activity across several animal models of CNS diseases. Based on these studies, we believe ETX-155 is a promising investigational therapy for treatment of psychiatric mood disorders and focal onset seizures. We believe ETX-155 has several potential advantages that, collectively, differentiate it from other product candidates in the GABAA PAM therapeutic class and could represent a compelling clinical profile.
 •Dual synaptic and extrasynaptic activity. ETX-155’s design to bind at the synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs is believed to cause enhanced phasic and tonic inhibition, which can lead to decreased neuronal excitability. We believe that both types of inhibition are important for neurosteroid clinical efficacy in depression and epilepsy, as suggested by the positive clinical results of brexanolone and zuranolone in depression and ganaxolone in epilepsy, all of which have dual activity at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs.
 •Consistency of effect. Phase 1 clinical trials demonstrate that taking ETX-155 with or without food does not result in a clinically meaningful difference in pharmacokinetics, specifically with the Cmax, and the total drug exposure (AUC). This is a unique characteristic in contrast to other GABAA PAMs such as ganaxolone, brexanolone and zuranolone which are reported to require administration timed with a meal to achieve desired clinical outcomes. Given challenges with patient compliance, we believe the lack of a clinically meaningful food effect is an important patient-centric differentiation that should allow patients the flexibility to take therapy with or without a meal while maintaining a consistent therapeutic exposure.
 •Once a day dosing. ETX-155 demonstrated a half-life of approximately 40 hours in a Phase 1 study in healthy human subjects, which provides confidence the agent can be utilized in a once-a-day evening dosing regimen. We believe this will be a competitively differentiated and favorable dosing regimen for patients. The pharmacokinetic data for ETX-155 compares favorably with other GABA PAM product candidates in development, which have demonstrated half-lives ranging from approximately 2 hours to 18 hours.
 •Potential for favorable therapeutic window across a broad set of CNS indications. To date, ETX-155 has shown encouraging safety and tolerability data in its SAD and MAD Phase 1 clinical trials. The exposures attained from the 60 mg dose in our Phase 1 MAD cohorts are consistent with the exposures that led to robust activity of ETX-155 in our preclinical models of depression, anxiety and epilepsy. This increases our confidence that 60 mg has the potential to be an efficacious dose in the indications we are pursuing. Separately, we believe the favorable tolerability data demonstrated in our SAD and MAD clinical trials and the activity observed in preclinical models will support our evaluation of a range of doses to potentially offer physicians different dose levels, allowing for patient-centric dosing.


Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
 MDD is a long-term, sometimes lifelong mood disorder capable of causing severe impairments that interfere with the ability to carry out life activities. MDD is a recurrent disease and follows a fluctuating course of depressive episodes over an individual’s lifetime, with periods of remission and relapse. MDD episodes are characterized by periods of at least two weeks of persistent depressed mood and/or the loss of interest in activities, accompanied by symptoms such as sleep and appetite disturbance, fatigue, concentration difficulty, cognitive impairment, feelings of guilt, agitation and suicidal ideation. The 12-month prevalence of MDD in 2020 was estimated to be 35 million across the major markets of the United States, Europe and Japan. It was also recently reported that serious depression symptoms have increased by more than 3-fold overall during the COVID-19 pandemic, though the long-term impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of MDD remains to be determined.
 MDD is difficult to treat, with current approaches utilizing a “trial-and-error” sequential treatment strategy because there are no consistently identified predictors of differential response across treatment modalities. The most used current therapeutic treatments for MDD include mixed SNRIs and SSRIs, dopaminergic/noradrenergic agents and atypical antipsychotics. Nearly two thirds of treated MDD patients are unable to achieve an adequate response with first-line therapy, and most of these initial failures also fail second-line treatment, according to results from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, the largest prospective clinical trial of MDD treatments, published in 2010. In the major markets of the United States, Europe and Japan there are estimated to be more than 13 million MDD patients who have failed one prior class of antidepressant therapy, and an estimated 3.4 million who have failed two prior classes of antidepressants.
 Even for patients deemed responsive, disease burden often persists through the presence of residual depression symptoms that lead to an ongoing negative impact on home life and interpersonal functioning, as well as a significantly increased risk of relapse of the full depressive syndrome and worse comorbid outcomes, including suicide. All the currently available classes of treatment have side effects that can negatively impact treatment outcomes, quality of life and adherence to medication, including weight gain, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, insomnia and numerous other adverse effects. In addition, typically current therapeutic treatments take up to six weeks before efficacy is established, which exposes patients to additional potential side effects and an increased period of suffering, before it is established if a treatment is working. In part because of the long time to achieve benefit from current antidepressant therapies, many people with MDD opt to stay on their treatment chronically, enduring longer periods of side effects, rather than opting for episodic treatment.
 Because MDD is increasingly acknowledged as a fluid spectrum of mood disorders and the patient population is heterogeneous, polypharmacy and treatment-switching strategies that consider a patient’s dynamic course of disease and fluctuating symptoms are becoming more commonplace. There is a need both for novel treatments with alternative mechanisms of action as well as treatments that improve upon liabilities of existing drugs. Importantly, because of patient heterogeneity, switching therapies within a class can lead to improvements in efficacy and tolerability which can be as impactful as switching to a medication in a different class.
 Perimenopausal Depression (PMD)
 PMD describes the development of depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes in women during the approximately four-to-eight-year period of menopausal transition occurring in women between approximately 45-55 years of age, with an estimated 50 million women worldwide reaching menopause annually.
 The perimenopausal period is associated with multiple neurologic symptoms believed to be associated with a reduction of estrogen/progesterone production and consequently a disruption of multiple estrogen/progesterone-regulated systems in neuronal circuits.
 Various studies have found the prevalence of depression symptoms in women during this perimenopausal period as between 15% and 50%. While women with a prior history of MDD are approximately 2-3 times as likely to experience depressive episodes during the perimenopausal period, this period is associated with a 2-fold increased risk in the development of significant depression symptoms in women with no prior history of MDD.
 Proven therapies for MDD are recommended as frontline therapy for perimenopausal major depressive episodes, and there is some evidence that estrogen therapy in perimenopausal patients may have antidepressant effects, though it is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression. As with MDD, currently available anti-depressant/anti-psychotic therapies do not provide the desired efficacy in the majority of perimenopausal women, and these agents continue to have the same tolerability liabilities. Novel treatments, which are safe, well-tolerated and rapidly acting are needed. Antidepressant therapies that can also address other symptoms of perimenopause such as hot flashes, insomnia, pain and decline in cognitive function, all of which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms, are needed.


The opportunity for GABAA PAMs in the treatment of hormone-related depression has been validated by the clinical success of brexanolone and SAGE-217 in women with PPD, which, like PMD, is also linked to dramatic fluctuations in estrogen/progesterone levels. Brexanolone received FDA approval for the treatment of PPD in 2019 after demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score with a 60-hour IV infusion of brexanolone compared to placebo in Phase 3 trials. Similarly, the orally administered GABAA PAM, SAGE-217, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HAM-D in a Phase 3 trial in women with PPD.
 MDD and PMD Unmet Need and Opportunity for ETX-155
 Despite numerous antidepressant treatment options, there continues to be an unmet need for antidepressants that provide rapid onset of effect, higher remission rates, efficacy throughout the depressive episode, an improved tolerability profile and an episodic dosing schedule that is aligned with the episodic nature of the disease. A GABAA PAM that potentiates the activity of endogenous neuroactive steroids at GABAA receptors may offer broader and more rapid therapeutic benefit compared to current standard of care antidepressants, potentially enabling effective episodic treatment of depressive episodes as they arise. Further, we believe a GABAA PAM like ETX-155 with the potential differentiated ability to be dosed once a day in the evening with no clinically meaningful food effect could create an exciting commercial opportunity in an attractive, expanding market.
 Epilepsy and Focal Onset Seizure
 Epilepsy is a chronic CNS condition characterized by recurring seizures arising from hyperexcitable neuronal circuits. The condition encompasses multiple seizure types and syndromes, diverse etiologies and variable prognoses and as such, classification systems have been developed. Classification is made at three levels: seizure type, epilepsy type and syndrome. At each stage, cause and comorbidities should be identified as these can have important therapeutic implications. Most seizures can be categorized as either “focal” or “generalized”, depending on whether the onset of electrical activity affects one side (focal) or both sides (generalized) of the brain.
 Epilepsy is the most prevalent chronic brain disease and affects an estimated 50 million people worldwide with over 4.7 million cases in the major markets of the United States, Europe and Japan. FOS (also referred to as focal seizure, partial-onset seizure, or localization-related epilepsy) is a category of seizures that originate from a localized region of the brain and represent the most common seizure disorder encountered in patients with epilepsy. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, about 60% of people with epilepsy experience FOS/partial-onset seizures.
 The aim of ASM therapy is to achieve a seizure-free status without debilitating adverse side effects. Current standard of care for epilepsy/FOS is treatment with one or more ASMs in continuous prophylactic schemes. There are approximately 30 ASMs currently approved in the United States, which act via several different mechanisms including sodium/calcium channel inhibition, potassium channel activation and glutamate receptor antagonism, among others. Many approved ASMs have Black Box warnings and/or dose-limiting side effects that can limit the ability to maintain therapeutic dose levels necessary for seizure control, with adverse effects including sedation, ataxia, cognitive impairment, weight gain and agitation. Because of the diversity of mechanisms, polypharmacy of ASMs is common if patients fail first-line therapy or have tolerability issues, with the addition of new drugs to a regimen, or switching to alternative drugs, to provide better seizure control and/or improved tolerability.
 Despite the range of treatment options available, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients with focal onset seizures are considered drug-resistant and are either unable to maintain seizure control after three prior ASM therapies, or are unable to tolerate such ASMs. The inability to control seizures may result in severe disability, increased mortality rates and socioeconomic consequences such as lower levels of employment and income and increased direct and indirect healthcare costs. Although seizures are the most striking clinical manifestation of epilepsy, other effects on quality of life arise from common co-morbidities including cognitive dysfunction (e.g., memory, attention, or processing difficulties), sleep disorders, migraines and mental health/mood disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety).
 Depression is the most common co-morbidity of epilepsy, with a reported lifetime prevalence of major depression in approximately 30% among individuals with epilepsy. This increased rate of depression may in part be due to the side effects of current ASMs, a comorbidity of epilepsy itself, or a combination of the two.


Focal Onset Seizure Opportunity for ETX-155
 By acting as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAARs, ETX-155 is designed to increase the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, potentially leading to anticonvulsant activity. As a result of its preclinical anti-convulsant activity and its potential positive impact on mood, we believe that ETX-155 has the potential to be positioned as a differentiated treatment option in refractory focal onset seizure. A well-tolerated, novel ASM with a favorable efficacy profile in refractory focal onset seizures combined with a positive impact on mood would be a clinically differentiated profile and an attractive alternative for patients.
ETX-155 Preclinical Development
 ETX-155: a potent positive allosteric modulator of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors
 ETX-155 is designed as a neurosteroid GABAAR positive allosteric modulator and has dual potency at both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Using automated patch clamp electrophysiology against 19 different synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptor subtypes, ETX-155 demonstrated approximately equal potency on all subtypes, with EC50 values ranging from 95 nM to 330 nM including 207 nM and 165 nM EC50 at the most predominant synaptic (α1ß2g2) and extrasynaptic (α4ß3g) subtypes, respectively.
 High intrinsic activity, a measure of the potentiation of GABAA currents, was demonstrated across GABAA receptor subtypes, with ETX-155 having an approximately 3 times higher intrinsic activity at extrasynaptic α4ß3g subtype (1530%) vs. synaptic α1ß2g2 (586%).
 In our in vitro assessments, the potency and activity of ETX-155 across GABAA subtypes was comparable to that of SAGE-217 and ganaxolone. In contrast, data publicly disclosed by Praxis Precision Medicines reported a preference for extrasynaptic versus synaptic GABAA receptors for the neurosteroid GABAA PAM, PRAX-114.


Preclinical anti-seizure activity
 We investigated the preclinical activity of ETX-155 in a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced seizure model and a maximal electroshock (MES) model of epilepsy, which are well-established predictive models for clinical anti-convulsant activity. In these studies, ETX-155’s activity was evaluated in parallel experiments with ganaxolone, another GABAA PAM in development for epilepsy indications, and valproate was used as a positive control. In both the PTZ and MES models, ETX-155 and valproate demonstrated encouraging dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity. The GABAA PAM ganaxolone did not achieve statistically significant efficacy in either model at matched doses up to 10 mg/kg.
 
Figure 14. Activity of ETX-155, ganaxolone and valproate (positive control) in two preclinical seizure models. (a) Mice were pretreated with control or test article and then were given a bolus intraperitoneal injection of PTZ to induce acute seizures, followed by the observation of the seizure profile and latency times. ETX-155 (at all doses tested) and valproate significantly increased the latency time to the first full tonic seizure. Ganaxolone did not achieve statistical significance in this experiment. (b) The MES model is an electrically-induced acute seizure model of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Mice were pretreated with control or test article and then were subjected to seizure-inducing electric shock. The magnitude of the resulting seizure was evaluated using a seizure severity ranking from 0 to 6. Valproate and 10 mg/kg of ETX-155 significantly decreased the seizure rank. Ganaxolone did not achieve statistical significance in this experiment.


Preclinical anti-depressant and anxiolytic activity
 The activity of ETX-155 was investigated in preclinical models of anxiety and depression. The anxiety models included the elevated plus maze, social interaction and marble burying paradigms. ETX-155 and SAGE-217, another GABAA PAM in development for mood disorder indications, showed a dose-dependent efficacy in all models. As shown in Figure 15a a, ETX-155 and SAGE-217 dose-dependently improved the time spent in open arms (a measure hypothesized to reflect reduced levels of anxiety) in the rat elevated plus maze behavioral model. The forced swim model in rats was used to assess to potential anti-depressant activity of ETX-155 and SAGE-217 (Figure 15b). Both compounds demonstrated a dose-dependent statistically significant efficacy.
 
Figure 15. Efficacy of ETX-155 and SAGE-217 in (a) an anxiolytic (elevated plus maze) preclinical model in rats, where the anxiety level is evaluated by the amount of time animals spent in the open arms of a plus-shaped apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms. (b) a depression (forced swim test) model in rats based on the animal’s level of activity (climbing or swimming) when placed in an enclosed container filled with water, where the level of immobility of the animal is hypothesized to indicate a depressive mood.


Preclinical EEG model as a biomarker of dose-dependent target engagement
 We used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effect of ETX-155 on brain activity in rats. In this model, changes in the EEG spectral power, reflecting a change in cortical neuronal activity, serve as a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker for target engagement with strong translatability from rats to humans. ETX-155 increased spectral power of the theta, alpha, beta, and low gamma frequencies, and decreased the power of the high gamma frequency. Figure 16 below demonstrates the dose-dependent increase in beta power during wake and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.

Animals were dosed at 8pm and EEGs were recorded from 2 hours pre-dose to 22 hours post-dose.
 Clinical Development
 ETX-155 Repeat Dose Phase 1 trials
 The 7-day repeat dose portion of our Phase 1 trial of ETX-155 (Study 020155-101) enrolled two cohorts of subjects, with 12 participants in each cohort dosed for 7 days. The first cohort was dosed with 60 mg of ETX-155 daily in the morning while fasted while the second cohort was dosed 60 mg of ETX-155 daily in the evening at approximately 8:00 PM. Both cohorts consisted of nine active subjects and three placebo subjects. In both cohorts, no significant adverse events were seen, there were no subject discontinuations nor were there any clinically significant abnormal values in vital signs, ECGs and clinical labs. However, the 60 mg cohort dosed in the evening experienced fewer adverse events. The advantage of dosing GABAA PAMs in the evening has also been demonstrated with other molecules in clinical development such as SAGE-217, PRAX-114 and ganaxolone.
 In the 7-day repeat dose Phase 1 trial, ETX-155 was well tolerated with no dose limiting AEs, no discontinuations and no abnormal clinical values. We believe the safety and tolerability data observed in this trial compare favorably to other GABAA PAMs in clinical development. With respect to pharmacokinetics, during this portion of the trial, ETX-155 did not reach steady-state drug levels at day seven and moderate accumulation was seen. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that steady-state was likely to be reached shortly after day seven. Therefore, we initiated an additional randomized, placebo-controlled 14-day repeat-dose trial in healthy human subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters at steady-state and generate additional data on the tolerability and safety profile of ETX-155.
The 14-day repeat dose Phase 1 clinical trial (Study 020155-102) was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of ETX-155 in 20 healthy human subjects, evaluating 60 mg ETX-155 (n=15) or placebo (n=5) dosed daily in the evening for 14 days. The results demonstrated that ETX-155 reached steady state concentrations in plasma by the eighth day of dosing and had an approximate 40-hour half-life, confirming ETX-155’s desirable profile for a once-daily dosing regimen. The study also confirmed that ETX-155 was generally well tolerated with no severe or serious adverse events, or discontinuations. All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including CNS adverse events, were mild/moderate and transient. In particular, all somnolence adverse events were mild and the incidence was comparable in the ETX-155 and placebo groups. Notably, somnolence events were sporadic, and no subject who reported somnolence in either the ETX-155 or placebo arms reported it more than one time during the dosing or follow-up period. In addition, there was no clinically meaningful difference compared to placebo in sleep quality or next morning state of arousal, as measured by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. The tolerability and safety findings of this study were consistent with those of the previous 7-day repeat dose Phase 1 study.


Figure 17 below summarizes the adverse events observed of ETX-155’s repeat dose Phase 1 trials in healthy human subjects.
 

Figure 17. Summary of all treatment emergent adverse events from the evening dose cohorts of the repeat dose Phase 1 trials in healthy human subjects, evaluating 60 mg ETX-155 dosed daily in the evening for either 7 days or 14 days.
 Our analysis of the plasma concentrations observed for the 60 mg dose of ETX-155 in the 7-day repeat dose trial found that the mean plasma exposure at day 7 was consistent with the range of exposures where robust activity was observed in our depression, anxiety, anticonvulsant and EEG preclinical models. In addition, the exposures achieved with the 60 mg dose of ETX-155 in the MAD in healthy volunteers are consistent with those modeled for another GABAA PAM, zuranolone (SAGE-217), at the 30 mg and 50 mg dose levels in its MAD trial in healthy volunteers. This observation increases our confidence that the 60 mg dose achieves the necessary level of exposure to potentially be an efficacious dose in the indications we are pursuing. Combined with the favorable tolerability data demonstrated by this dose level in the Phase 1 trials, we intend to move forward with this dose into our future clinical trials in patients.
 As part of the 14-day repeat dose trial we also conducted exploratory metabolite identification from plasma and urine PK samples. Metabolites were identified, and additional metabolite characterization and qualification work is ongoing.
 ETX-155 Phase 1b Photosensitive Epilepsy trial
 
We initiated a double-blind crossover Phase 1b trial in Photosensitive Epilepsy (PSE) patients in November 2021 with interim data expected in the first half of 2022. Pharmacological effects in PSE proof-of-concept trials are correlated with a higher likelihood that anticonvulsant effect will be observed in later stage epilepsy studies. Assuming the results of this trial are positive, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with focal onset seizures in the first half of 2023.
 Planned Phase 2 clinical trials for ETX-155 in depression
 We plan to initiate two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a proof-of-concept trials of ETX-155 in MDD and PMD, respectively, in the first half of 2022, assuming FDA clearance of our IND filed with the psychiatry division in the first quarter of 2022.
 ETX-155 Phase 2a in MDD
 This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 28-day study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ETX-155 in male and female subjects aged 18 to 70 years with recurrent MDD that has previously responded to treatment. The study will enroll subjects who have a current diagnosis of MDD for at least 4 weeks before screening. The study will include a screening phase, a 28-day treatment phase, and a post-treatment follow-up phase. A total of 80 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the ETX-155 or placebo treatment group.

ETX-155 Phase 2a in PMD
 This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 28-day study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD of ETX-155 in perimenopausal or menopausal women aged 40 to 67 years who have a current diagnosis of MDD that has been present for at least 4 weeks before screening. The study will include a screening phase, a 28-day treatment phase, and a post-treatment follow-up phase. A total of 80 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the ETX-155 or placebo treatment group.
 

Figure 18. ETX-155 MDD and PMD Phase 2a study design
 The primary endpoint for both MDD and PMD Phase 2a trials is the change from baseline over days 3, 8, 15, 22, and 29 in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score. Topline data from both studies is expected in the second half of 2023.
 Preclinical Pipeline
 Kv7.2/3 Program for Epilepsy and Pain
 Our lead preclinical program is a next-generation Kv7.2/3 channel opener being developed for potential use in epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and depression. Kv7.2/3 is a heteromeric voltage-gated potassium channel comprised of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits (Kv7.2/3) that plays an important role in stabilizing the membrane potential of neuronal cells and controlling neuronal excitability. Kv7.2/3 has genetic validation as a target for epilepsy, as loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding for Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, have been shown to be responsible for a rare epilepsy disorder in newborns that leads to impaired gating of the Kv7.2/3 channel and hyperexcitation of neurons.
 In addition to its genetic validation, Kv7.2/3 has been clinically validated as a therapeutic target for both epilepsy and pain. The first generation Kv7 channel opener, ezogabine (Potiga), was approved for refractory focal onset seizures in 2011 in both the United States and in Europe (where it was known as retigabine, or Trobalt). Flupirtine (Katadolon) was another first generation Kv7.2/3 opener that provided clinical validation and has been used in Europe as a treatment for pain since the 1980s. Despite demonstrating compelling efficacy in epilepsy and pain, ezogabine/retigabine and flupirtine were removed from the market in 2017 and 2018, respectively, due to emergent unexpected safety concerns. In the case of ezogabine, an accumulation of blue pigment in the skin and eye was identified, raising concerns of potential vision loss, while flupirtine was associated with severe liver toxicity, including cases of acute liver failure. Xenon Pharmaceuticals’ Kv7 targeted agent, XEN1101, also reported positive data in a Phase 2b study in focal onset seizure in October 2021, providing further clinical validation for this mechanism.
We have used a combination of both ligand-based and structure-based design approaches to develop novel Kv7.2/3 opener compounds that potentially eliminate the toxicity liabilities associated with the first generation Kv7.2/3 openers, while retaining strong activity and selectivity. We plan to initiate IND-enabling studies for this program in 2022.
Next-generation Anxiolytic for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
 Our second preclinical program is focused on developing a novel, potent analog of an earlier approved 2,3-benzodiazepine for the potential treatment of GAD. The aim of our program is to develop a rapidly acting, non-sedating, non-addictive anxiolytic that does not impair motor or cognitive performance, does not have any adverse drug-drug interactions, and has the potential to be dosed once a day. We plan to progress preclinical development of this program in 2022.
Competition
 The biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, therapeutics and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective or more convenient or have fewer or less severe side effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, cost, the level of branded and generic competition, market access and reimbursement by payors, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
DPNP and LSRP
 In the fields of DPNP and LSRP, our principal competition is from existing therapies including NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, and opioids. Specifically, patients diagnosed with LSRP are usually prescribed with NSAIDs, gabapentinoids (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin), or opioids. DPNP patients are often treated with antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline and other tricyclic drugs), gabapentinoids, or opioids (e.g., tapentadol HCl). We are aware of a number of therapies that are approved to treat other types of neuropathic pain. We are also aware that various therapies are used off-label to treat neuropathic pain. Our competition may also include other programs in clinical development targeting other mechanisms of actions for the treatment of DPNP and LSRP.
Depression and Epilepsy
 In the field of neuroactive steroids focused on modulation of GABAA receptors, our principal competitors are Sage Therapeutics, Inc. developing zuranolone for PPD and MDD, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. developing ganaxolone for rare epilepsies, and Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc. developing PRAX-114 in MDD. Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc. is also developing a GABAA PAM, CVL-865, for the treatment of epilepsy, but unlike the neurosteroids, CVL-865 reportedly binds to the benzodiazepine site of synaptic α2/3/5 GABAAR subtypes.
 For the treatment of depressive disorders, we may also face competition from other programs in clinical development targeting other mechanisms of action and approved therapies for depressive disorders such as mixed serotonin modulators, SNRIs, SSRIs, dopaminergic/noradrenergic agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Several biopharmaceutical companies have therapies in clinical development for depressive disorders targeting other mechanisms of action, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Axsome Therapeutics and Compass Pathways.
 For the treatment of epilepsy, we may also face competition from a variety of currently marketed therapies such as generic anticonvulsants, sodium channel modulators and benzodiazepines. Additionally, there are next-generation therapies in development harnessing the previously mentioned mechanisms of action, such as XEN901 being co-developed by Xenon Pharmaceuticals and Neurocrine Biosciences. Furthermore, there are multiple compounds that have been recently approved or are in late-stage development for focal onset seizures, including cenobamate, which was developed by SK Life Sciences and was approved by the FDA in November 2019, and XEN1101, being developed by Xenon Pharmaceuticals.


We expect to face competition from existing products and products in development for each of our product candidates. In addition to those described above, there may be other earlier stage clinical programs that, if approved, would compete with our product candidates. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and any associated novel discoveries, drug development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position for our product candidates by, among other methods, filing and acquiring U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products and other proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 Our intellectual property estate is designed to provide multiple layers of protection, including: (1) patents and patent applications with claims directed to our product candidates; (2) patent applications with claims directed to methods of treatment using our product candidates; and (3) patent applications with claims directed to innovative formulations.
 While we seek to cover our product candidates and their use in our issued patents and pending patent applications, there is always a risk that a modification of the product or its use may allow a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire, and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products.
 ETX-810. The compound in this product candidate is covered by a patent family that covers the compound (both generically and specifically) and use of the compound to treat various pain conditions. This patent family includes an issued U.S. patent and pending patent applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan. The European Patent Office recently confirmed that the European patent application will be considered allowable subject to minor modifications. The compound portfolio is expected to expire on October 12, 2037, excluding any patent term extension or adjustments that may be granted. We also filed a priority application in the United Kingdom covering a new process for preparing ETX-810 and a US provisional application covering a new formulation comprising ETX-810.
 We will leverage new discoveries we are making in the research of ETX-810 by filing patent applications thereon to strengthen the breadth and depth of our patent coverage for this product candidate.
 ETX-155. Our intellectual property portfolio covering ETX-155 includes two issued U.S. patents, a first with method claims covering use of the composition of matter to treat an anxiety disorder, depression, or a seizure disorder; and a second with composition claims covering a controlled release formulation of ETX-155. The portfolio additionally includes two pending international patent applications under the Paris Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that preserve our future right to file these PCT international applications into individual foreign countries and a pending U.S. application with method claims covering uses of the composition of matter to treat sleep disorders. The issued U.S. patents and any future patents claiming priority thereto are expected to expire in September 2039, excluding any patent term extensions or adjustments that may be granted. Any foreign patents that issue claiming priority to the international application are expected to expire in September 2040. In the last year, we also filed multiple U.S. provisional applications covering methods of treatment and formulations of ETX-155.
 We are also working to develop new formulations of ETX-155 and new uses for ETX-155, which we intend to file patent applications on in order to expand the layers of protection provided by our intellectual property estate.


Patent Protection and Terms
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), delay in issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, can make it easier to challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any patents that may issue, and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.
 Third-Party Patent Filings
 Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our products or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may be aware of patent applications, but incorrectly predict the likelihood of those applications issuing with claims of relevance to us.
 Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method.
 Trade Secrets and Other Protections
 In addition to the protections afforded by patents and other regulatory protections, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets may be useful to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or which we elect not to patent. Trade secrets may also be useful for processes or improvements for which patents are difficult to enforce. We also protect our products and proprietary technology through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.


Infringement of Third-Party Proprietary Rights
 Our commercial success will depend in part on not infringing upon or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could also be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing product or technology. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations. For more information regarding these risks, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our nonclinical and clinical compound supply through third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs).
 For clinical supply, we use CDMOs who are obligated to act in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), for the manufacture of drug substance and product. We expect to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and the production of all clinical supply drug substance and drug product and currently expect to continue to do so for commercial supplies of our product candidates, if approved. We use additional contract manufacturers to fill, label, package, store and distribute our investigational drug products and currently expect to continue to do so for commercial supplies of our product candidates, if approved. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for any product candidates that complete clinical development.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of prescription drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of drug products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice (DOJ) or other governmental entities.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
 •Submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


•Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA, including agreement to compliance with any post-approval requirements; and
 •Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 Preclinical studies
 Before testing any drug or biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies generally include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess potential toxicity, which support subsequent clinical testing. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points are generally prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor to obtain the FDA’s feedback on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 Marketing application submission and FDA review and approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for priority applications.


The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA (for a standard review) because the FDA has approximately two months, or 60 days, after submission to make a “filing” decision on whether to accept an NDA for review.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 Additionally, the FDA may refer any application to an advisory committee, including applications for novel drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized (PREA), certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information and for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA; it may require additional clinical or preclinical testing and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.


Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 Fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast-track designation, breakthrough-therapy designation and priority-review designation.
 To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. Fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 In addition, with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast-track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an NDA for a new molecular entity from the date of filing. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application for a new molecular entity is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.


Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 U.S. marketing and data exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain follow-on drug applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic or follow-on version of the protected drug product, respectively, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity when an NDA or a supplement to an existing NDA, includes new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant that are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or follow-on 505(b)(2) NDAs if the protected clinical data are not referenced. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a stand-alone NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a stand-alone NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, if applicable.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
 Post-approval requirements
 Following approval of a new prescription drug product, the manufacturer and the approved drug are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to monitoring and recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs must be promoted by a manufacturer and any third parties acting on behalf of a manufacturer only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved label for the product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims or changes to the manufacturing processes or facilities, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.


Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •Fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •Issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.


Other healthcare laws and regulations
 Healthcare providers, including physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, customers, healthcare providers, physicians and others, in connection with the clinical research, sales, marketing and promotion of products, once approved, and related activities, may expose a pharmaceutical manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In particular, the research of our product candidates, as well as the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services and certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business or financial arrangements. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
 •the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Further, courts have found that if “one purpose” of renumeration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback statute is violated. Violations are subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between biopharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution;
 •the U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (FCA), which can be enforced through “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing such an obligation. to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, a claim submitted for payment to any federal healthcare program that includes items or services that were made as a result of a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;
 •the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA fraud provisions without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;


•the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under the Open Payments Program, information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals, (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 •U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
 •analogous U.S. state, local and foreign laws and regulations, such as U.S. state anti-kickback, false claims and laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and other relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and the results of operations. In addition, commercialization of any drug product outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business with are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar penalties.


Data privacy and security laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides data privacy rights for consumers and operational requirements for companies. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023.
 The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.
 Further, the exit of the United Kingdom (U.K.), from the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the U.K. From January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or the U.K. GDPR, which, together with the amended U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in U.K. national law. The U.K. GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the U.K. and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how U.K. data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated in the long term. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. The European Commission published a draft adequacy decision on February 19, 2021. If adopted, the decision will enable data transfers from EU member states to the U.K. for a four-year period, subject to subsequent extensions.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. More recently, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law to reauthorize the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act.


In addition, in both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes regarding the health care system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), effective as of January 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration with impact the ACA and our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. There also has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other health reform initiatives. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse measures that were initiated by the former Trump administration or pursue similar policy initiatives.


At the state level, legislatures in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.
 In the European Union and in other foreign jurisdictions, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or EU member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.
 Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will likely continue into the future.
 Rest of world regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product development, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution, marketing approval, advertising and promotion, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Additionally, to the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Additional laws and regulations governing international operations
 If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered by U.S. authorities that enforce the FCPA, including DOJ, to be foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
 Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.


The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage, pricing and reimbursement status of any products seeking regulatory approval. Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are paid for by third-party payors, such as government health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), health maintenance organizations, managed care providers, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. These third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and will establish reimbursement levels.
 In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
 Increasing efforts by third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates, if approved, may nonetheless not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. We expect to experience pricing pressures from third-party payors in connection with the potential sale of any of our product candidates.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
