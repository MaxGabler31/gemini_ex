ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (“CPRL”), together with its subsidiaries (“CP” or the “Company”), owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States (“U.S.”). CP's diverse business mix includes bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic over a network of approximately 12,500 miles, serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montreal, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia ("B.C."), and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. Agreements with other carriers extend the Company's market reach east of Montreal in Canada, through the U.S. and into Mexico. For additional information regarding CP's network and geographical locations, refer to Item 2. Properties. 
CPRL was incorporated on June 22, 2001, under the Canada Business Corporations Act and controls and owns all of the Common Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (“CPRC”), which was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of Canada. The Company’s registered, executive and corporate head office is located at 7550 Ogden Dale Road S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9. CP's Common Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CP”.
For purposes of this report, all references herein to “CP,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to CPRL, CPRL and its subsidiaries, CPRL and one or more of its subsidiaries, or one or more of CPRL's subsidiaries, as the context may require. All references to currency amounts included in this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, are in Canadian dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.
Strategy
In 2012, CP began a transformational journey to become the best railroad in North America, with a long-term strategy centred on five key foundations:

• | Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company’s customers. “Doing what we say we are going to do” is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making.


• | Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success.


• | Optimize Assets: Through faster train speeds, improved asset utilization and increased train lengths, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.


• | Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. CP strives for continuous implementation of state-of-the-art safety technology, safety management systems, and safety culture with our employees to ensure safe, efficient operations across our network.


• | Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company is shaping a new culture focused on a passion for service with integrity in everything it does. Coaching and mentoring managers into becoming leaders will help drive CP forward.

During the turnaround, CP transformed its operations by investing in the network and executing a precision railroading model that lowers costs, optimizes assets, and provides better, more competitive service. 
Today, the long-term strategy remains the same: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP’s journey to become North America’s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. We continue to build on this strong foundation, focused on the next level of productivity, service, and innovation to generate value for our customers and deliver results for our shareholders. 
Business Developments
As of June 30, 2017, CP qualified as a foreign private issuer in the U.S. for purposes of the Exchange Act as a result of changes to the Company's Board, as evaluated at June 30, 2017. Although as a foreign private issuer CP is no longer required to do so, the Company currently continues to file annual reports on the Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC instead of filing the reporting forms available to foreign private issuers. The Company prepares and files a management proxy circular and related material under Canadian requirements.

Operations
The Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by business line, the overall financial and operational performance of the Company is analyzed as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. Additional information regarding the Company's business and operations, including revenue and financial information, and information by geographic location is presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 25 Segmented and geographic information.
Lines of Business
The Company transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. Bulk commodities, which typically move in large volumes across long distances, include Grain, Coal, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur. Merchandise freight consists of industrial and consumer products, such as energy, chemicals, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Automotive and Forest products. Intermodal traffic consists largely of retail goods in overseas containers that can be transported by train, ship and truck and in domestic containers and trailers that can be moved by train and truck.
The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from transporting freight. The following chart shows the Company's freight revenue by each line of business in 2017:
In 2017, the Company generated freight revenues totalling $6,375 million ($6,060 million in 2016 and $6,552 million in 2015). The following charts compare the percentage of the Company’s total freight revenues derived from each of the three major business lines in 2017, 2016 and 2015: 
BULK
The Company’s Bulk business represented approximately 44% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Bulk freight revenues by commodity business in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Grain
The Company’s grain business represented approximately 54% of Bulk revenues, which is 24% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Grain freight revenues generated from Canadian and U.S. shipments in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
CP's grain network is unique among railways in North America as it is strategically positioned in the heart of grain-producing regions of Western Canada and the Northern Plains of the U.S. Canadian grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, canola, durum, soybeans and pulses, and processed products such as meals, oils and malt. This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver, and east to the Port of Thunder Bay for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., to eastern Canada, and to Mexico for domestic consumption.
Canadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the Canada Transportation Act (“CTA”). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (“MRE”). Under this regulation, railroads can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railroad based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
U.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, durum, corn and soybeans, and processed products such as meals, oils and flour. This business is centred in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa. Grain destined for domestic consumption moves east via Chicago, to the U.S. Northeast or is interchanged with other carriers to the U.S. Pacific Northwest and U.S. Southeast. In partnership with other railroads, CP also moves grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Export grain traffic is shipped to ports at Superior and Duluth.
Coal
The Company’s Coal business represented approximately 22% of Bulk revenues, which is 10% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Coal freight revenues generated from Canadian and U.S. shipments in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
CP handles mostly metallurgical coal destined for export for use in the steelmaking process. CP’s Canadian coal traffic originates mainly from Teck Resources Limited’s mines in southeastern B.C. CP moves coal west from these mines to port terminals for export to world markets (Pacific Rim, Europe and South America), and east for the U.S. Midwest markets.
In the U.S., CP moves primarily thermal coal from connecting railways, serving the thermal coal fields in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming, which is delivered to power-generating facilities in the U.S. Midwest. 
Potash
The Company's Potash business represented approximately 15% of Bulk revenues, which is 6% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Potash freight revenues generated from domestic and export potash shipments in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
The Company’s Potash traffic moves mainly from Saskatchewan to offshore markets through the ports of Vancouver, B.C., Portland and Thunder Bay, and to markets in the U.S. All potash shipments for export beyond Canada and the U.S. are marketed by Canpotex Limited, a joint venture among Saskatchewan’s potash producers, and K+S Potash Canada. Independently, these producers move domestic potash with CP primarily to the U.S. Midwest for local application.
Fertilizers and Sulphur
The Company's Fertilizers and sulphur business represented approximately 9% of Bulk revenues, which is 4% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Fertilizers and sulphur freight revenues generated from wet fertilizers, dry fertilizers, and sulphur transportation in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Dry fertilizers include: phosphate, urea, and ammonium sulphate and nitrate; wet fertilizers are primarily anhydrous ammonia. Roughly half of CP's fertilizer shipments originate from production facilities in Alberta, where abundant sources of natural gas and other chemicals provide feedstock for fertilizer production.
Most sulphur is produced in Alberta as a byproduct of processing sour natural gas, refining crude oil and upgrading bitumen produced in the Alberta oil sands. Sulphur is a raw material used primarily in the manufacturing of sulphuric acid, which is used most extensively 
in the production of phosphate fertilizers. Sulphuric acid is also a key ingredient in industrial processes ranging from smelting and nickel leaching to paper production.
MERCHANDISE
The Company’s Merchandise business represented approximately 35% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Merchandise freight revenue by commodity business in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Merchandise products move in trains of mixed freight and in a variety of car types. Service involves delivering products to many different customers and destinations. In addition to traditional rail service, CP moves merchandise traffic through a network of truck-rail transload facilities, expanding the reach of CP's network to non-rail served facilities.
Forest Products
The Company’s Forest products business represented approximately 12% of Merchandise revenues, which is 4% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Forest products freight revenues generated from pulp and paper (wood pulp, paper, paperboard, newsprint), lumber and panel, and other shipments in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Forest products traffic includes pulp and paper, and lumber and panel shipped from key producing areas in B.C., northern Alberta, northern Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec to destinations throughout North America.
Energy, Chemicals and Plastics
The Company’s Energy, chemicals and plastics business represented approximately 41% of Merchandise revenues, which is 14% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Energy, chemicals and plastics freight revenues generated from petroleum products, biofuels, crude, chemicals and plastics shipments in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Petroleum products consist of commodities such as liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”), fuel oil, asphalt, gasoline, condensate (diluent) and lubricant oils. The majority of the Company’s western Canadian energy traffic originates in the Alberta Industrial Heartland, Canada's largest hydrocarbon processing region, and Saskatchewan. The Bakken formation region in Saskatchewan and North Dakota is another source of condensate, LPG and other refined petroleum. Interchange with several rail interline partners gives the Company access to refineries and export facilities in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast U.S. and the Gulf Coast, as well as the Texas and Louisiana petrochemical corridor and port connections.
The Company’s chemical traffic includes products such as ethylene glycol, caustic soda, methanol, sulphuric acid, styrene and soda ash. These shipments originate from Alberta, the U.S. Midwest, the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Canada, and move to end markets in Canada, the U.S. and overseas.
CP's biofuels traffic originates mainly from facilities in the U.S. Midwest, shipping to destinations in the northeastern U.S.
Crude moves from production facilities throughout Alberta, Saskatchewan and North Dakota. We provide efficient routes to refining markets in the Northeast U.S., the Gulf Coast and the West Coast through connections with our railroad partners.
The most commonly shipped plastics products are polyethylene and polypropylene. Almost half of the Company’s plastics traffic originates in central and northern Alberta and moves to various North American destinations.
Metals, Minerals and Consumer Products
The Company’s Metals, minerals and consumer products business represented approximately 34% of Merchandise revenues, which is 12% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Metals, minerals and consumer products freight revenues generated from aggregates (excluding frac sand), frac sand, steel, food and consumer products and non-ferrous metals transportation in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Aggregate products include coarse particulate and composite materials such as cement, clay, gravel, limestone and gypsum. Cement accounts for the majority of aggregate traffic and is shipped directly from production facilities in Alberta, Iowa and Ontario to energy and construction projects in North Dakota, Alberta, Manitoba and the U.S. Midwest.
The majority of frac sand originates at mines located along the Company’s network in Wisconsin and moves to Texas, the Bakken, Colorado, Ohio and other shale formations across North America.
CP transports steel in various forms from mills in Iowa, Ontario and Saskatchewan to a variety of industrial users. The Company carries base metals such as zinc, aluminum, copper and lead. CP also moves ores from mines to smelters and refineries for processing, and the processed metal to automobile and consumer products manufacturers.
Food and consumer products traffic consists of a diverse mix of goods, including food products, railway equipment, building materials and waste products.
Automotive
The Company’s Automotive business represented approximately 13% of Merchandise revenues, which is 5% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Automotive freight revenues generated by movements of finished vehicles from Canadian, U.S., Mexican, and overseas origins, machinery, and parts and other in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
CP’s Automotive portfolio consists of four finished vehicle traffic components: Canadian-produced vehicles that ship to the U.S. from Ontario production facilities; U.S.-produced vehicles that ship within the U.S. as well as cross border shipments to Canadian markets; vehicles from overseas that move through the Port of Vancouver to eastern Canadian markets; and Mexican-produced vehicles that ship to the U.S. and Canada. In addition to finished vehicles, CP ships machinery, pre-owned vehicles, and automotive 
parts. A comprehensive network of automotive compounds is utilized to facilitate final delivery of vehicles to dealers throughout Canada and in the U.S.
INTERMODAL
The Company’s Intermodal business represented approximately 21% of total freight revenues in 2017.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Intermodal freight revenues generated from Canada, U.S., cross border transportation, ports and Other International in 2017, 2016 and 2015:
Domestic intermodal freight consists primarily of manufactured consumer products moved in 53-foot containers within North America. International intermodal freight moves in marine containers to and from ports and North American inland markets.
CP’s domestic intermodal business moves goods from a broad spectrum of industries including retail, wholesale, less-than truckload, full-truckload, food, forest products and various other commodities. Key service factors in domestic intermodal include consistent on-time delivery, the ability to provide door-to-door service and the availability of value-added services. The majority of the Company’s domestic intermodal business originates in Canada, where CP markets its services directly to retailers and manufacturers, providing complete door-to-door service and maintaining direct relationships with its customers. In the U.S., the Company’s service is delivered mainly through intermodal marketing companies ("IMC").
CP’s international intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver and Montreal and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. CP works closely with the Port of Montreal, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in the U.S. Midwest and Canada. The Company’s U.S. Northeast service connects eastern Canada with the Port of New York, offering a competitive alternative to trucks.
Fuel Cost Adjustment Program
The short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On Highway Diesel; as such, fuel surcharge revenue is a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 4% of the Company's total Freight revenues in 2017. The Company is also subject to carbon taxation systems and levies in some jurisdictions in which it operates, the costs of which are passed on to the shipper. As such, fuel surcharge revenue includes carbon tax and levy recoveries.  
Non-freight Revenues
Non-freight revenues accounted for approximately 3% of the Company’s Total revenues in 2017. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets, switching fees, and other arrangements, including logistical services and contracts with passenger service operators.
Significant Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no customer comprised more than 10% of total revenues or accounts receivable.
Competition
The Company is subject to competition from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Price is only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transportation service provider. Service is another factor and requirement, both in terms of transit time and reliability, which vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation. CP’s primary rail competitors are Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in Canada, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, including its primary subsidiary BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in the U.S. Midwest. Other railways also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.
Seasonality
Volumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Great Lakes ports and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve over the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs and increased demand for retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions.
Government Regulation
The Company’s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed. 
Operations are subject to economic and safety regulation in Canada primarily by the Canadian Transportation Agency (“the Agency”), Transport Canada, the CTA and the Railway Safety Act (“RSA”). The CTA provides shipper rate and service remedies, including final offer arbitration, competitive line rates and compulsory inter-switching in Canada. The Agency regulates the MRE for the movement of export grain, commuter and passenger access, charges for ancillary services, and noise-related disputes. Transport Canada regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada.
The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to economic and safety regulation by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) and the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”). The STB is an economic regulatory body with jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and proposed railroad mergers and other transactions. The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company’s railway operations in the U.S. under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. 
Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company’s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental and other matters. 
Regulatory Change 
After the tragic accident in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, in July of 2013 involving a non-related short-line railroad, the Government of Canada implemented several measures pursuant to the RSA (Canada) and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (Canada). These modifications implemented changes with respect to rules associated with securing unattended trains; the classification of crude being imported, handled, offered for transport or transported; and the provision of information to municipalities through which dangerous goods are transported by rail. The U.S. federal government has taken similar actions. These changes did not have a material impact on CP’s operating practices. 
On February 20, 2015, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-52 “An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act”, which received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015, and is now in force. Bill C-52 sets out new minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on: amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards ("TIH")/poisonous inhalation hazards moved; imposes strict liability; limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level; mandates the creation of a fund of $250 million paid for by a levy on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond $1 billion (in respect of CP); allows railways and insurers to have existing rights to pursue other parties (subrogation); and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement. As the implementation by the Government of various aspects of the amendments is still being completed, the Company is not yet able to determine their full impact.
On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Transportation Secretary announced the final rule for a new rail tank car standard for flammable liquids and the retrofitting schedule for older tank cars used to transport flammable liquids. The development of the new tank car standard was done in coordination between Transport Canada, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and the FRA. This announcement was followed by publishing the new tank car standard in Canada on May 20, 2015. The new tank car standards require new tanks used to move flammable liquids to have: top-fitting protection; thermal protection including a jacket; the use of 9/16 inch normalized steel for the tank car; full head shield; and improved bottom outlet valves. In the U.S., the new standards also included new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids such as the use of electronically controlled pneumatic (“ECP”) brakes for trains carrying 70 or more cars of flammable liquids, routing requirements, speed restrictions, and information for local government agencies. The U.S. rule also provides new sampling and testing requirements for the classification of energy products placed into transport. In Canada, operational protocols such as speed restrictions to 40 miles per hour in census metropolitan areas, crude sampling and testing requirements, and sharing information with municipal first responders, had previously been implemented. CP does not own any tank cars used for commercial transportation of hazardous commodities.
On May 16, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-49, the Transportation Modernization Act, in Parliament. The bill proposes amendments to the CTA and the RSA, among other Acts, to (1) replace the existing 160 kilometre extended interswitching limit and the competitive line rate provisions with a new long-haul interswitching regime; (2) modify the existing Level of Service 
remedy for shippers by instructing the Agency to determine, upon receipt of a complaint, if a railway company is fulfilling its common carrier obligation to provide “adequate and suitable accommodation” of traffic, if it is satisfied that the service provided is the “highest level of service that is reasonable in the circumstances”; (3) allow the existing Service Level Agreement arbitration remedy to include the consideration of reciprocal financial penalties; (4) increase the threshold for summary Final Offer Arbitrations from $750,000 to $2 million; (5) bifurcate the Volume-Related Composite Price Index component of the annual MRE determination for transportation of regulated grain, to encourage hopper car investment by CP and CN; and (6) mandate the installation of locomotive voice and video recorders ("LVVRs"), with statutory permission for random access by railway companies and Transport Canada to the LVVR data in order to proactively strengthen railway safety in Canada. The bill is currently being considered by the Parliament of Canada. It is unclear when the proposed legislative amendments will be enacted into law. 
On October 29, 2015, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 was signed into law. The law extends, by three years, the deadline for the U.S. rail industry to implement Positive Train Control (“PTC”), a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and other accidents caused by human error by determining the precise location, direction and speed of trains, warning train operators of potential problems, and taking immediate action if an operator does not respond. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008 mandated that PTC systems be put into service by the end of 2015 on rail lines used to transport passengers or toxic-by-inhalation materials. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 extended the deadline to install and activate PTC to December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2020 under certain circumstances, allowing the Company additional time to ensure safe and effective implementation of PTC on its rail network.
For further details on the capital expenditures associated with compliance with the PTC regulatory mandate, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
On December 4, 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act was signed into law, representing the first long-term transportation legislation enacted in the U.S. in over a decade. The FAST Act contains key provisions on safety enhancements for tank cars moving flammable liquids in the U.S. and ECP train braking. Among those key provisions, the FAST Act requires new tank cars to be equipped with thermal blankets, requires all legacy DOT-111 tank cars moving flammable liquids to be upgraded to new retrofit standards (regardless of how many cars may be in a train), and sets minimum requirements for protection of certain valves. The FAST Act calls for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to re-evaluate its ECP final rule within the next year using the results of this evaluation to determine whether ECP braking system requirements are justified. On December 4, 2017, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) found the ECP brake rule costs outweigh the benefits. By statute, DOT is now required to repeal the ECP brake rule and has begun the necessary procedures to effectuate that repeal.
Finally, the STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 was signed into law on December 18, 2015. The law requires numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the Department of Transportation and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board’s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes. It is too soon for the Company to anticipate the impact that these changes and new investigative authorities might have on CP, since no arbitrations or, to CP's knowledge, investigations have been initiated under recently adopted rules implementing these laws.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company’s operating results and reputation.
The Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as air emissions, wastewater, management of vegetation, chemicals and waste, storage tanks and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established Strategic Emergency Response Contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested.
The Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically and regularly assesses the Company’s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company’s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and semi-annual review by senior management.
CP focuses on key strategies, identifying tactics and actions to support commitments to the community. The Company’s strategies include:

• | protecting the environment;


• | ensuring compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;


• | promoting awareness and training;


• | managing emergencies through preparedness; and


• | encouraging involvement, consultation and dialogue with communities along the Company’s lines.

Security
CP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Regulations by the DOT and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially TIH materials. Legislative changes in Canada to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act are expected to add new security regulatory requirements similar to those in the U.S. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company’s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operating results.

CP takes the following security measures:


• | CP employs its own police service that works closely with communities and other law enforcement and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services are headquartered in Calgary, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operate on the CP rail network as well as in areas where CP has non-railway operations.


• | CP’s Police Communication Centre (“PCC”) operates 24 hours a day. The PCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials, and ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies.


• | CP’s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modeled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001.
