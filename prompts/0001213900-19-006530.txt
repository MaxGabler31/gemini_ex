ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Currently, we are engaged in the manufacture and sales of textile dyeing and finishing machines and sharing economy businesses.
 
Through December 30, 2016, we operated in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufactured and sold precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries. On December 30, 2016, we sold the stock in the entity that was engaged in the forged rolled rings and related components segment. Accordingly, the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
During 2016, we manufactured and sold petroleum and chemical equipment. We referred to this business as our petroleum and chemical equipment business. Because of a significant decline in revenues from this business, we determined that we would not continue to operate in this segment and accordingly, we reflect the operations of the petroleum and chemical equipment segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Through our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.
 
We design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. Historically, the Chinese government’s mandate to phase out older machinery in China’s textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards has benefitted us. However, in recent years, challenging economic conditions, increases in raw materials prices and the Chinese government’s more aggressive stance toward shutting down factories, including textile manufacturers, that are not compliant with emission standards, have adversely impacted our dyeing and finishing businesses. Due to rising production costs, many other textile manufacturers are closing or relocating to other countries outside of China in Southeast Asia.
 
In an effort to improve our product offering and appeal to textile manufacturers outside of our current customer base in China, we have developed prototypes of next generation dyeing and finishing equipment utilizing a patent we purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018. We are also diversifying our manufacturing operations to target other industries outside of the textile industry and are constructing a mobile phone cover production line. As of the date of this annual report, the line is nearly completed and we expect to begin production in the first half of 2019. We are actively exploring other new ventures and opportunities that could contribute to our business in the future. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible.
 
On December 26, 2016, Dyeing and an unrelated individual formed Wuxi Shengxin New Energy Engineering Co., Ltd. (“Shengxin”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and the unrelated third party holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province. Shengxin paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will invest in new solar farm or provide the subsidies needed to fund projects. In September 2018, due to significance doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company’s investment, we fully impaired the value of its investment in Shengxin in the amount of approximately $8.7 million (equivalent to Rmb59.8 million). At December 31, 2018, Shengxin’s assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $15,000, $16.3 million and $14,000, respectively, and liabilities consisted of other payables of approximately $51,000. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s share of Shengxin’s net loss were $199,410 and $130,498, respectively.
 
Given the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2018.

Contractual arrangements with the Huayang Companies and their stockholders
 
We have contractual arrangements with the Huayang Companies and their stockholders, who are our chief executive officer, Jianhua Wu, and his wife, Lihua Tang, pursuant to which we provide these companies with technology consulting and other general business operation services. Through these contractual arrangements, we also have the ability to substantially influence these companies’ daily operations and financial affairs, appoint their senior executives and approve all matters requiring stockholder approval. As a result of these contractual arrangements, which enable us to control the Huayang Companies, we are considered the primary beneficiary of the Huayang Companies. Accordingly, we consolidate the results, assets and liabilities of the Huayang Companies in our financial statements. 
 
Our relationships with the Huayang Companies and their stockholders are governed by a series of contractual arrangements between Green Power, our wholly foreign owned enterprise in the PRC, and each of the Huayang Companies, which are our operating companies in the PRC. Under PRC laws, each of Green Power, Dyeing and Heavy Industries is an independent legal person and none of them is exposed to liabilities incurred by the other parties. Other than pursuant to the contractual arrangements between Green Power and the Huayang Companies described below, generally, neither of the Huayang Companies transfers any other funds generated from its operations to the other Huayang Company. On October 12, 2007, we entered into the following contractual arrangements with each of the Huayang Companies.
 
Consulting Services Agreement. Pursuant to the exclusive consulting services agreements between Green Power and each of the Huayang Companies, Green Power has the exclusive right to provide to the Huayang Companies general business operation services, including advice and strategic planning, as well as consulting services related to the technological research and development of dye and finishing machines, electrical equipment and related products. Under this agreement, Green Power owns the intellectual property rights developed or discovered through research and development, in the course of providing its services under the agreement, or derived from the provision of the services. The Huayang Companies shall pay a quarterly consulting service fees to Green Power that is equal to all of the Huayang Companies’ profits for such quarter. The term of this agreement, as amended on November 1, 2008, is 20 years from October 12, 2007 and may be extended only upon Green Power’s written confirmation prior to the expiration of the agreement, with the extended term to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Our Dyeing and Finishing Business
 
Historically, our primary operations involved the design, manufacture and distribution of a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.
 
The textile industry in China has been facing significant headwinds recently. Difficult economic conditions, higher labor costs, a continuing decline in oil prices and limited availability of credit in China, presented numerous challenges for our dyeing machine business. Additionally, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout 2018 by China’s environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China’s environmental laws. In 2018, reports estimate that China has dispatched inspectors in as many as 30 provinces around the country and 80,000 factories—roughly 40 percent of the factories in China—have been fined, charged or closed because of their emissions. As a result, many of our customers are unable to purchase new equipment or are planning to relocate to other countries in Southeast Asia with lower production cost. This has caused softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers have already upgraded to new models and the remaining potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, if we are to sell our products to the smaller textile manufacturers, it may be necessary for us to design and market a cheaper machine that meets the Chinese government requirements or reduce prices which would impact both revenues and gross margin.
 
We design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. We believe that we are one of the leading domestic Chinese manufacturers of textile dyeing machines, and our Huayang brand is nationally recognized. We currently have the capacity to manufacture and assemble approximately 600 textile-dyeing machines annually. Our state-of-the-art and automated production line enables us to manufacture our products efficiently, with lower labor and energy costs compared to traditional manufacturing methods. As part of our manufacturing process, we make corrosion-resistant stainless steel pumps and pressure vessels, which are not only critical components for our dyeing and finishing products but have other industrial applications as well.
 
We hold 33 Chinese patents, of which eight are described under “Intellectual Property Rights.” These patents cover an innovative production technique enabling more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature and pressure, the dyeing liquid mixing device, dyeing liquid atomizing device, horizontal manipulated devices, mechanical seal and atomizer of its airflow dyeing machine and cover components of the hot air circulation system of low emission air flow dyeing machines.
 
Our dyeing and finishing products are generally compact in design compared with alternatives on the market and feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing a wide variety of yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. In 2010, we introduced an advanced dyeing technology enabling a quick, economic and environment-friendly operation designed for optimal performance. The liquid pressure and quantity are adjusted to the respective type and quantity of fabric. The special layout of the pressure pump circuit is designed to provide constant and safe operations of the machine reducing resources wastage and enhancing performance.

We developed a high (low) temperature airflow dyeing machine. We believe that this new model of dyeing machine is efficient and cost effective and meets the requisite Chinese environmental standards. In September 2014, we received two Chinese patents which cover components of the hot air circulation system of our low emission air flow dyeing machines. We believe that the hot air circulation system helps to enhance the machines’ ability to produce higher quality textiles with a better look and feel.
 
We have developed a new air-fluid, dual-use dyeing machine which uses both air flow and fluid flow in the dyeing process. It allows users to customize the dyeing process according to the specific type of textile. It is equipped with a series of specialized and patented components, including nozzles, cloth wheels and cloth spreaders, which are designed to permit greater color evenness and reduce defects. It can be used on a wider range of textiles and uses 60% to 70% less water, about 30% less power and 40% to 50% less steam than traditional models of high-temperature, high-pressure dyeing machines and reduces the use of additives by about 50% while shortening dyeing time by one to two hours.
 
In August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We believe this patent technology will allow us to develop next generation dyeing and finishing equipment that will appeal to textile manufacturers in China as well as Southeastern Asia, particularly Vietnam and Bangladesh. We have developed a few prototypes based on this patent technology and have begun taking orders in small quantities. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018.
 
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we conducted an impairment assessment on property, equipment and intangible asset based on the guidelines established in ASC Topic 360 to determine the estimated fair market value of property, equipment and intangible asset as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Such analysis considered future use of such equipment, consultation with equipment resellers, subsequent sales of price of equipment held for sale, and other industry factors. Upon completion of the 2018 impairment analysis, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in our Dyeing business segment. Accordingly, in connection with the impairment of such equipment, the Company recorded impairment charges on long-lived assets of $6,257,583 and impairment loss on intangible assets of $1,893,625 for the year at December 31, 2018. We did not record impairment charges on long-lived assets and impairment loss on intangible asset for the year at December 31, 2017.
 
We are also diversifying our manufacturing operations to target other industries outside of the textile industry and are constructing a mobile phone cover production line. As of the date of this annual report, the line is nearly completed and we expect to begin production in the first half of 2019. We are actively exploring other new ventures and opportunities that could contribute to our business in the future. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible.

Our Sharing Economy Business
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018, we established new business divisions to focus on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses. We believe a true peer-to-peer sharing economy based on rentals will take significant market share in both the business and consumer markets over the next few years. 
 
Sharing economy business models are hosted through digital platforms that enable more precise, real-time measurement of spare capacity and have the ability to dynamically connect that capacity with those who need it. These digital platforms handle transactions that offer access over ownership through renting, lending, subscribing, reselling, swapping or donating. Consumers who use sharing economy business models are often more comfortable with transactions that involve deeper social interactions than traditional methods of exchange.
 
We have been exploring possible merger and acquisition opportunities that can bring to market more user-friendly platforms and convenient channels that allow people to rent what they need and make their lives easier. We are currently emphasizing the following areas:
 
On Demand Services
 
The ways people work and how services are provided has been changing, and there is a growing need for short-term services and workforces in the market. In December 2017, we acquired a 51% interest in Inspirit Studio Limited, which is engaged in developing a mobile app platform which provides instant errand services in a peer to peer model. BuddiGo, is our new mobile sharing platform that allows users to outsource daily chores and mundane tasks to “Buddies” who can spare idle time to run errands. According to iimediaResearch, the number of users participating in the peer-to-peer delivery sharing market in China has grown from 124 million in 2014 to 231 million in 2016, and experts expect it to grow to 353 million by the end of 2018.
 
During the year, BuddiGo, continuously promoted its service to the local market in Hong Kong. BuddiGo offers a wide range of errand services. Currently, about 80 percent of the orders received are for on-demand urgent delivery of items such as documents, flowers and cakes. Food delivery services are also available. During 2018, over 1,200 individuals have officially registered as sell-side buddies, who completed over 500 delivery orders in 2018, majority orders were happened in the third quarter. In addition, BuddiGo has signed up with a number of local business partners to provide ongoing delivery services for these clients. BuddiGo’s goal is to connect with the community and deliver localized content featuring BuddiGo’s core features and advantages. BuddiGo is actively seeking strategic investors or collaborative parties who are enthusiastic about its business model and can help achieve its business targets and expand into different countries.

Coworking and Coliving Development
 
According to Small Business Labs, the number of coworking spaces globally will exceed 30,000 by 2022, with over 5.1 million people utilizing coworking spaces. We are entering this market through partnerships and affiliations with current coworking and coliving space operators, including our recent acquisition of Anyworkspace.com, an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces. In 2018, AnyWorkspace focused on enlarging its exposure to the general public. We are currently revamping AnyWorkspace’s corporate website, www.anyworkspace.com. AnyWorkspace will also focus on digital marketing activities for its market expansion plans when there is available cash flow or funds from investors.
 Given the existing coworking spaces providers marketing their available spaces and managing individual online business platform themselves, we expect our current global online platform will take years to materialize its worldwide customer base. Therefore, the intangible asset amounted to $0.6 million (equivalent to HK$4.97 million) representing the online platform acquired has been fully impaired in the last quarter of 2018.
 
Technology Development
 
In January 2018, we acquired a 60% interest in 3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery’s space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong's leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality ("VR") industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world's largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app, Autocap, which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.
 
3D Discovery successfully completed a number of projects during the year. First, its “3D Virtual Tours in Hong Kong” generated about 1,371,000 impressions in 2018. In addition, 3D Discovery partnered with Midland Realty, one of the largest real estate agencies in Hong Kong, to establish the “Creation 200 3D Virtual Tours.” This business unit generated $215,000 in revenue in 2018.
 
We have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. We are working with our partners to develop SEII’s “Sharing Blocks,” a blockchain-based platform which provides functions for secured user profile information and transaction records through a “Blockchain as a Service” (BaaS) model, allowing third-party sharing economy applications to utilize and build a global consolidated and trustworthy sharing economy ecosystem. Our development team has completed the core engine development of “Sharing Blocks” and now undergoing system tests to ensure system performance, data integrity and accuracy, and security are all performing as expected.
 
In August 2017, we signed an agreement with ECoin Global Limited ("ECoin") for the future purchase of ECoin redemption codes with an aggregate value of $50 million for total consideration of $20 million. We plan to resell the redemption codes in the form of ECrent gift cards at global locales through reseller channels, such as convenience stores. We are working with InComm, a global pre-payment network and solution provider, to sell the redemption codes with face values of HK$100, HK$300 and HK$500 at major convenience store networks in Hong Kong and Macau with other international locations to follow. On December 20, 2018, the agreement was terminated without recourse to the company. No sales were made under the agreement.

Sharing Communities
 
Because the sharing economy is predicated on the trust of all participants, we believe the best way to establish sharing behaviors is within communities. We are currently working with ECrent Capital Holdings Limited ("ECrent"), a private company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands focused on developing and operating a global rental platform to promote sharing economy across 30 countries and regions.
Asia Region:
 
In 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a license agreement with ECRENT, regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Korea. According to the latest amendment, ECRENT will guarantee that the operation of its related websites, mobile applications and business services will contribute revenue of US$13,000,000 (increased from US$10,000,000 according to the previously amended agreement) and gross profit of US$2,522,000 (up from US$1,940,000 as stated on the previously amended agreement) from the closing date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2019 (extended from June 30, 2019 per the previously amended agreement).
 
In August 2018, SEIL has entered into a License Agreement with PTI Corporation (“PTI”), that sublicenses SEIL’s exclusive license with ECRENT to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in South Korea. In return, PTI shall pay to SEIL $230,000 (“Consideration”). The License Agreement will be effective on September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In addition, if the aggregate revenue during the period exceeds the Consideration, SEIL shall receive 30% of the difference between the aggregate revenue and the Consideration.

Solar Farm Joint Venture
 
On December 26, 2016, Dyeing and Xue Miao, an unrelated individual, formed Shengxin, in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and Mr. Xue holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. The agreement sets forth general terms relating to the proposed business, but does not set forth specific funding obligations for either party. Dyeing has agreed to invest RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,200,000) and had invested RMB 59.8 million ($9,189,397 at December 31, 2017, for which it received a 30% interest, and Mr. Xue has a commitment to invest RMB 140,000,000 (approximately $21.5 million), of which Mr. Xue has contributed RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9.2 million), for which Mr. Xue received a 70% interest in Shengxin. Shengxin’s registered capital is RMB 200 million (approximately $30.7 million). Mr. Xue has not funded the remaining RMB 80,000,000 (approximately $12.2 million) of his commitment.
 
Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province. Shengxin paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will invest in new solar farm or provide the subsidies needed to fund projects. In September 2018, due to significance doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company’s investment, we fully impaired the value of its investment in Shengxin in the amount of $8,711,336. At December 31, 2018, Shengxin’s assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $15,000, $16.3 million and $14,000, respectively, and liabilities consisted of other payables of approximately $51,000. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s share of Shengxin’s net loss were $190,410 and $130,498, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total aggregate loss on equity method investment in Shengxin were $8,901,746.
 
Our investment in Shengxin is subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot give any assurance that Shengxin will be able to obtain any permits, raise any required funding, develop and operate or sell any solar farms or operate profitably or that Dyeing will have the resources to provide any funds that may be required in order to fund any solar farm projects for which Shengxin may obtain permits. There may be a significant delay between the time funds are advanced for any project and the realization of revenue or cash flow from any project.

Marketing and Distribution
 
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of textile dyeing and finishing machines in China. We presently sell our products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, both regions with significant textile production, as well as in many of the coastal regions of China such as Shandong and Guangdong provinces.
 
We market and sell our products through our internal sales force, which is based in our facilities in Wuxi. Our marketing programs include industrial conferences, trade fairs, sales training and advertising. Our sales and marketing groups work closely with our manufacturing groups to coordinate our product development activities, product launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. We sell our products directly to many of China’s largest textile producers. However, as the large textile producers purchase equipment that complies with the Chinese regulations, they have less of a need for new equipment and many of the smaller textile producers do not have the available funding or credit facilities to enable them to purchase capital equipment such as our dyeing and finishing equipment.
 
Our sharing economy businesses are still in a very early stage of development. We intend to market and sell our services for these businesses primarily through online media advertising. Online marketing consists of search engine marketing, display advertisements, referral programs and affiliate marketing. We have established a business unit, EC Advertising Limited, to support these endeavors. EC Advertising will provide resources to support the marketing needs of the sharing economy businesses via partnerships and acquisitions of advertising companies.
 
Growth Strategies
 
According to China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the main focus of the country’s textile industry has shifted from gaining competitive advantages based on labor costs toward the objectives of developing scientific and technological innovation as well as brand creation.
 
In support of this objective, we are continuing our efforts to develop and implement next-generation low energy consumption and high heating efficiency features to our machines. The current emphasis of our efforts continues to be on increasing automation features in our existing products and implementing power line communication technology throughout our production facilities to enable our customers to reduce their use of electricity and water. However, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, our sales in this segment declined from $13.5 million in 2017 to $9.3 million in 2018, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our sales to his market. 
 
Given the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we have made the decision to focus on high growth opportunities and have added new sharing economy business units into the group. Our latest business initiatives are focused on targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.
 
Today, the sharing economy is in the process of disrupting and transforming numerous industries, changing both business and consumer behavior. The sharing economy redefines how resources are being provided and utilizes them in a more efficient way. According to Juniper Research, total sharing economy revenue is predicted to reach $40.2 billion by 2022. PwC UK forecasts the five most prominent sharing economy sectors – collaborative finance, peer-to-peer accommodation, peer-to-peer transportation, on-demand household services and on-demand professional services, could see a 20-fold increase to €570 billion by 2025 in European markets, up from just €28 billion today. The sharing economy is spreading across different industries and regions, creating new market behavior.
 
In 2017, we began studying and acquiring sharing economy platforms in different market disciplines. Following these efforts, we are now grouping our sharing economy markets in verticals such as coworking and co-living communities, on-demand peer-to-peer services, and other sharing communities.
 
We believe further mergers and acquisitions have the potential to grow the Company rapidly and aggressively in new market opportunities, technology, products and platforms. We will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.

Competition
 
Because of the importance of the Chinese textile industry in the world market, our dyeing and finishing business faces competition from both domestic and foreign suppliers. However, we believe that, due to the high quality of our products, our principal competition is from suppliers based in foreign countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy and France. Domestically, our chief competitor is Fong’s National Engineering (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Fong’s Industries Company Ltd., a Hong-Kong based conglomerate.
 
We believe that we can effectively compete with these companies on the basis of the quality and performance of our products, our after-sales service, and cost. We provide one year of maintenance and repair services for all of our products and based on historical experience, maintenance and repair service calls have been minimal. Moreover, we provide customers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, our top markets, with on-site support which is generally provided within 24 hours of receiving a request. However, many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial or technological resources than we do and presently enjoy greater brand recognition.
 
However, in trying to market our equipment to smaller textile companies, competition may be based more on price than quality, and we may not be able to price competitively without seriously eroding our margins. It may be necessary for us to develop lower price machinery to meet the price needs of the smaller textile manufacturers.
 
Further, as Chinese textile companies face competition from countries with a lower labor cost, the Chinese market for our equipment may decrease and we may not be able to market successfully to textile manufacturers in other countries.
 
The global sharing economy continues to evolve, and we face competition from technology companies, both large and small, throughout the world. The Company aims to become a pioneer in the development of sharing economy solutions. The group is developing different sharing economy applications with a common user and transaction processing engine, which will become a sharing economy ecosystem for the convenience of users as well as allowing the group to effectively share technologies and business data. Our different sharing economy solutions will have the ability to collaborate with each other, allowing us to provide one-stop combined solutions to the market. We believe the ability to leverage and collaborate between our different sharing businesses will increase our market competitiveness.
 
Source of Supply
 
In our dyeing and finishing business, stainless steel and other metals are the principal raw material for the manufacture of all of our products. We purchase stainless steel tubes from Wuxi City Zhongtian Stainless Steel Co., Ltd. and stainless steel plates from Wuxi City Fanshun Materials Co., Ltd. While we do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers, we have long-term business relationship with them, and these companies have generally met our supply requirements. For the textile machinery business, the price of steel can have more significant impact. Any significant rise in the price of or demand for stainless steel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Inflation has recently affected raw materials generally, and inflationary pressures could have a significant effect on our business. Other raw materials, such as stainless steel planks and transducers, are readily available from a number of suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.
 
In our sharing economy business, IT development resources are crucial for the near-term development of our sharing platforms. We are in the process of signing fixed man-day service contracts with our external development consultants to ensure the availability of IT development resources under a fixed pricing scheme for the near future. We will continue to expand our IT development support resources cross regionally to avoid the dependency on a single or small number of sources.

Research and Development
 
In our dyeing and finishing business, we incurred research and development expense in the amount of $499,000 and $420,000 related to the development of new Dyeing machinery and improvement of our existing dyeing machinery, and the development of a new mobile phone cover manufacturing line in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We are continuing product development with respect to the new dyeing machinery. 
 
In our sharing economy business, we have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. Given the early stage of the sharing economy business, we did not incur any R&D expenses in 2018. We expect this to increase in 2019 as we work on building this business and the associated IT and transaction platforms.
 
Government Regulations
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes, and we use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our operations. As a result, we are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding protection of the environment. Our operations are subject to regulations promulgated by China’s Environmental Protection Administration, Jiangsu Province Environmental Protection Administration and the Wuxi City Environmental Administration. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities in Wuxi. We have installed various types of anti-pollution equipment in our facilities to reduce, treat, and, where feasible, recycle the wastes generated in our manufacturing processes. We believe that our manufacturing facilities and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Based on the requirement of present law, we do not expect that any additional measures that may be required to maintain compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
 
The Chinese government has expressed a concern about pollution and other environmental hazards. Although we believe that we comply with current national and local government regulations, if it is determined that we are in violation of these regulations, we can be subject to financial penalties as well as the loss of our business license, in which event we would be unable to continue in business. Further, if the national or local government adopts more stringent regulations, we may incur significant costs in complying with such regulations. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by us to control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations.
 
Our products must also comply with applicable environmental regulations, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations applicable to our products.
 
Business Licenses
 
Dyeing has been issued a business license with the appropriate municipal and provincial government which specifically authorizes it to operate its business. The business license, which is subject to annual review by the issuing agency, is current as of the date of this annual report. No additional approval or license is required for the manufacturing and sale of the textile dyeing and finishing machines. 
 
We believe our sharing economy businesses are properly licensed with the appropriate government entities. However, because BuddiGo’s business model provides inner-city peer-to-peer delivery services, we could be identified as a member of the logistics industry by the governments of some countries where we conduct business. This could trigger additional licensing requirements. 
 
ISO Certification
 
Our dyeing and finishing business received the certificate to manufacture D1 and D2 levels of pressure vessels, which includes our current line of dyeing machines, from the Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau of Jiangsu Province. We received the certificate on December 7, 2007 and renewed it on December 21, 2015. This certificate expires on December 20, 2019.

Circular 106 Compliance and Approval
 
On May 31, 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued an official notice known as “Circular 106,” which requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters in China. Accordingly, in early September 2007, the owners of 100% of the equity in the Huayang Companies, namely Jianhua Wu and his wife, Lihua Tang, submitted their application to SAFE. On October 11, 2007, SAFE approved their application, permitting them to establish an offshore company, Fulland, as a “special purpose vehicle” for any foreign ownership and capital raising activities by the Huayang Companies. After SAFE’s approval, Mr. Wu and Ms. Tang became the majority owners of Fulland on October 11, 2007. Fulland was acquired by us in November 2007.
2019 Foreign Investment Law
 
On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress promulgated the 2019 Foreign Investment Law, which will become effective on January 1, 2020. The 2019 Foreign Investment Law will replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in the PRC, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
 
More details about the 2019 Foreign Investment Law are included in the section under Risks Related to Conducting Business in the PRC in Item 1A Risk Factors below.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. In addition to 24 other patents held by us, the eight Chinese patents, all of which relate to our dyeing products, are our principal patents. The patents were issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China in November 2012, as to the first patent, and June 2013 as to the other five and September 2014 as to the last two.
 
The following table sets forth information concerning our eight principal patents.
 

Patent No. | Description | Expiration 
--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------
ZL 2012 2 0165878.7 | a process to enable more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature and pressure | November 2022 
ZL 2012 2 0752919.2 | atomizer of airflow dyeing machine | June 2023 
ZL 2012 2 0752924.3 | mechanical seal for dyeing machine | June 2023

ZL 2013 1 0004736.1 | hot air circulation system of air flow dyeing machines | September 2034 

 
In August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018.

We intend to apply for more patents to protect our core technologies. We also have confidentiality and non-competition policies in place as part of our company employment guideline which is given to each employee, and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.
