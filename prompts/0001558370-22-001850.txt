Item 1. Business
Overview
Our vision is to improve the lives of patients and families suffering from rare muscle disorders by building the world’s leading muscle-focused, precision medicine company.
At Edgewise, patients are at the core of everything we do. We recognize that for patients with rare and debilitating diseases, every day without an effective treatment is a day too late and we are driven by this urgency to evolve disease knowledge with an aim to develop novel precision medicines for severe and rare disorders driven by muscle dysfunction. Our intimate knowledge of muscle biology and biophysics along with our ability to identify and design muscle specific precision small molecules have enabled us to rapidly advance our lead product candidate into clinical development while advancing our preclinical pipeline. From this foundation, we continue to build a leading, global biopharmaceutical company focused on rare diseases involving muscle in order to develop transformative precision medicines to treat and possibly cure these disorders.
In less than five years, we have matured into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments for severe, rare muscle disorders for which there is significant unmet medical need. Guided by our holistic drug discovery approach to targeting the muscle as an organ, we have combined our foundational expertise in muscle biology and small molecule engineering to build our proprietary, muscle-focused drug discovery platform. Our platform utilizes custom-built high throughput and translatable systems that measure integrated muscle function in whole organ extracts to identify small molecule precision medicines regulating key proteins in muscle tissue, initially focused on addressing rare neuromuscular and cardiac diseases.
Since our inception in 2017, our precision medicine muscle platform has generated several programs to address a variety of muscle disorders. We are advancing one clinical-stage program and two preclinical programs.
Our lead product candidate, EDG-5506, is an orally administered allosteric, selective, fast myofiber (type II) myosin small molecule inhibitor designed to address the root cause of dystrophinopathies including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Both of these disorders are rare and often debilitating diseases, and we estimate that in the United States there are approximately 12,000 to 15,000 DMD patients and 4,000 to 5,000 BMD patients. As a selective fast myosin inhibitor, EDG-5506 presents a novel mechanism of action designed to selectively limit injurious stress caused by lack of dystrophin by moderating fast skeletal muscle myosin force development and thereby compensating for the absence of functional dystrophin. Our preclinical data with EDG-5506 in animal models of muscular dystrophy demonstrated that selective regulation of fast (type II) myofiber contraction protected muscle from damage, reduced systemic fibrosis and improved measures of muscle function including strength and ability to engage in physical activities, which we believe may provide evidence of a disease modifying effect. A unique observation from our preclinical work is that EDG-5506 led to pronounced prevention of cardiac fibrosis. This is a highly relevant finding, particularly if replicated in clinical observations, since cardiac myopathy is a major driver of mortality in both DMD and BMD.
EDG-5506 was evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of EDG-5506 in adult healthy volunteers (HVs) (Phase 1a) and in adults with BMD (Phase 1b). Our Phase 1a data in HVs demonstrated that EDG-5506 was generally well-tolerated and amenable to daily dosing. Our Phase 1b data in

BMD patients demonstrated proof of concept by showing a significant reduction in key biomarkers of muscle damage. We believe EDG-5506 has potential therapeutic utility as either a standalone or combination therapy for patients suffering from rare muscular dystrophies, if approved. 
We also intend to advance two other muscle-focused precision medicines into clinical development. Our second program, EDG-5440, is a next generation myosin ATPase modulator designed to target skeletal muscle in a specific set of rare neuromuscular diseases. Our third program, EDG-002, focuses on identification of novel mechanism cardiac modulators. We are initially pursuing a new target for inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in addition to exploring the potential of this novel mechanism across other cardiac disorders. Our preliminary preclinical studies offer evidence that our EDG-002 program has the potential to yield molecules that could become a new therapeutic option for the treatment of HCM as well as other cardiac disorders. We anticipate candidate selection of a novel cardiac modulator for inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from our EDG-002 cardiac muscle program in the second half of 2022. We believe our programs also offer substantial opportunities for us to expand into related rare diseases for which there are limited or no approved treatments. We are currently focusing on the development of EDG-5506 and anticipate advancing our preclinical programs into the next stage of development in the near term. While EDG-5440 and EDG-002 are important preclinical programs to us, we have not needed to devote significant financial resources to these programs to date since they are still in preclinical development and have not yet advanced into clinical trials.
Our Pipeline
Using our proprietary drug discovery platform, we are developing a pipeline of precision medicine product candidates that target key muscle proteins and modulators to address a broad array of genetically defined muscle disorders. We have retained global development and commercialization rights to all of our programs. Our current pipeline is summarized below.

Our History and Team
We have assembled an experienced and highly motivated management team with a strong track record in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. We are focused on building a leading, patient-centric, fully integrated global rare disease company. Members of our team have extensive expertise in muscle disorders, small molecule drug discovery and development and patient advocacy with proven track records at organizations including Alexion, Amgen, Array Biopharma, Catabasis, Cytokinetics, Genzyme, GlaxoSmithKline, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Pfizer and Biogen.
We were co-founded in 2017 by our Chief Scientific Officer, Alan Russell, Ph.D., Peter Thompson, M.D., who is currently a Partner at OrbiMed and Badreddin Edris, Ph.D., who is currently the Chief Operating Officer at SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. through funding provided by OrbiMed. Dr. Russell has extensive experience in developing novel therapeutics for diseases involving skeletal muscle, having previously served as Vice President and Head of the Muscle 

6



Metabolism Discovery Performance Unit at GlaxoSmithKline from 2010 to 2017 and as Associate Director, Muscle Biology and Therapeutics at Cytokinetics from 2002 to 2010, where he was the co-inventor of tirasemtiv and reldesemtiv, direct muscle sensitizers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
We are led by Kevin Koch, Ph.D., who has been in the life science industry for over 30 years with a focus on drug discovery, translational medicine and clinical development. Dr. Koch previously served as the Senior Vice President of Drug Discovery, Chemical and Molecular Therapeutics at Biogen where he managed global drug discovery and biomarker development. Dr. Koch was a co-founder of Array BioPharma, serving as President, Chief Scientific Officer and Board member from the company’s inception in 1998 to 2013. While there, he built a fully integrated research and development team that oversaw the invention of over 20 clinical development candidates across multiple therapeutic areas, several of which are now marketed medicines. Prior to Array, Dr. Koch held senior positions at Amgen and Pfizer Central Research. Additionally, our Chief Business Officer, Behrad Derakhshan, Ph.D., our Chief Financial Officer, R. Michael Carruthers, our Chief Medical Officer, Joanne Donovan, M.D., Ph.D., and our General Counsel, John Moore, each have more than 15 years of experience in drug research, clinical development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, business development and commercialization of novel medicines, particularly in a range of devastating rare diseases.
Further, we have built a scientific advisory board with experts in the field of muscle diseases affecting both children and adults. Our scientific advisors include researchers who publish widely-cited articles on the skeletal and cardiac aspects of muscular dystrophy as well as on inherited forms of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, some of our advisors lead clinical units at some of the leading muscle disease centers in the United States and are actively involved in our drug development process and programs.
As a private company, we raised $160.7 million from leading institutional investors which include OrbiMed, Novo Holdings A/S, U.S. Venture Partners (USVP), Deerfield Management, Viking Global Investors, New Leaf Ventures, Janus Henderson Investors, RA Capital Management, Cormorant Asset Management, Logos Capital, Wellington Management, CureDuchenne Ventures and an undisclosed institutional investor. We also raised $186.1 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in March 2021.
Our Strategy
Our vision is to improve the lives of patients and families suffering from rare muscle disorders by building the world’s leading muscle-focused, precision medicine company. Key components of our strategy to achieve this vision include:

● | Engaging comprehensively with patients and their families and physicians to develop trusted relationships, transparent communications, and become a leader in the muscular dystrophy stakeholder community. By positioning ourselves as a trusted partner that moves with thoughtful urgency, we will continue to work to understand the needs of patients in order to inform our development of EDG-5506 and other programs for neuromuscular and other diseases. We will seek to better appreciate the burden of disease from the patient perspective, understand the current standard of care and unmet needs in managing the disease and learn what is most meaningful to patients.

● | Leveraging clinical and regulatory precedents and our extensive experience in rare diseases to rapidly advance EDG-5506 through clinical development in DMD, BMD and other muscle diseases. Our lead product candidate, EDG-5506, is a modulator of fast (type II) skeletal muscle myosin designed to selectively limit injurious stress caused by lack of dystrophin. We plan to prioritize the development of EDG-5506 in DMD and BMD given the limited or lack of approved treatments and significant unmet medical need. In October 2020, we initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EDG-5506 in adult HVs (Phase 1a) and in adults with BMD (Phase 1b). Leveraging the aggregated Phase 1 safety and tolerability and exposure data, we plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials in 2022. The first clinical trial will be in BMD and will assess longer duration safety and tolerability, exposure levels, changes to biomarkers of muscle breakdown and functional observations in an adolescent and adult patient population. The second clinical trial will be a Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial in pediatric DMD patients. Assuming positive results,

we also plan to explore the potential for breakthrough designation and/or an accelerated approval pathway. We believe EDG-5506 has a clear and predictable mechanism of action that will allow us to define objective clinical endpoints and leverage charted regulatory pathways to increase the likelihood of success of drug development and commercialization. We are also exploring the impact that fast skeletal myosin regulation may have on other skeletal muscle disorders common in adults, including slower-onset forms of muscle myopathies such as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD).

● | Investing in our precision medicine drug discovery platform to fuel the development of novel targeted therapies to expand our pipeline into additional skeletal and cardiac muscle disorders. Building upon our success in designing small molecule inhibitors of fast skeletal myosin, we are leveraging our proprietary drug discovery platform and capabilities to create precision medicines for muscle disorders with high levels of unmet need. In addition to EDG-5506, we have characterized a second fast skeletal myosin inhibitor product candidate selected from our pool of diverse myosin inhibitors for the treatment of additional fast muscle-mediated movement disorders. We are also advancing EDG-002, our research program directed to cardiac disorders.

● | Integrating our scientific expertise, development capabilities and growing network of patient advocacy groups and collaborators to develop novel therapies addressing muscle diseases with the highest unmet need. Our company was founded based on an in-depth understanding of skeletal muscle disease and integrative physiology, coupled with our strong drug discovery capabilities and a desire to improve the lives of patients with rare muscle diseases. In addition to this expertise, we have established a growing network of key stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, key opinion leaders, research institutions, regulators and payors, to ensure our efforts remain guided by the needs of patients suffering from rare muscle diseases. We will continue to work closely with these collaborators to inform our development programs and strategies to potentially bring transformational therapies to these communities as we build a patient-centric organization.

● | Opportunistically evaluating strategic collaborations and asset acquisition opportunities to accelerate development and commercialization timelines as well as potentially expand our pipeline within our core therapeutic areas. We have retained global development and commercialization rights to all of our programs and intend to maximize their commercial opportunity across global markets. We plan to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. We currently intend to build a focused commercial organization in the United States to market any of our drug candidates that are approved. Outside the United States, we will evaluate strategic opportunities to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates with collaborators whose development and commercial capabilities complement our own. We will also evaluate select external opportunities to strategically expand our pipeline.

Our Proprietary Drug Discovery Platform
Our precision medicine muscle platform enables the discovery and development of therapies with disease modifying potential
Muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body. Skeletal muscle alone accounts for 40% to 50% of body mass. In addition to being critical for the regulation of contraction driving the production of force, skeletal muscle also serves as an endocrine organ regulating metabolism and neuronal activities as well as the production of systemic mediators of growth, inflammation and regeneration. Skeletal muscle’s physiological role impacts multiple organ systems and is a complex mix of redundancies and feedback loops that require an intricate knowledge of muscle at a whole-body level in order to successfully develop drugs for muscle diseases.
We believe that our approach can overcome many of the obstacles facing skeletal and cardiac muscle drug discovery and development that have resulted in a lack of disease modifying therapies for inherited muscle disorders. Our

Our Programs
EDG-5506 for Treatment of Patients with DMD and BMD
Overview
We are developing a myofiber stabilizing therapy that represents a novel mechanistic approach designed to address the root cause of dystrophin deficient muscular dystrophies. EDG-5506, our most advanced product candidate, is an orally administered, allosteric, selective, fast myofiber (type II) myosin modulator that is designed to be inactive against slow myofiber (type I) myosin present in both skeletal muscle and the heart. Our preclinical data for EDG-5506 in animal models with muscular dystrophy demonstrated that selective regulation of fast (type II) myofiber contraction protected muscle from damage, decreased systemic fibrosis and improved measures of muscle function including strength and physical activities. EDG-5506 was evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of EDG-5506 in adult HVs (Phase 1a) and in adults with BMD (Phase 1b). Our Phase 1a data in HVs demonstrated that EDG-5506 was generally well-tolerated and amenable to daily dosing. Our Phase 1b data in BMD patients demonstrated proof of concept by showing a significant reduction in key biomarkers of muscle damage. Type II myosin modulation prevents muscle damage via a blockade of the biophysical stress response during normal muscle contractile activity thus stabilizing the muscle and protecting the muscle from damage. As such, it is a potentially complementary approach to dystrophin replacement strategies which also stabilize muscle through the re-expression of truncated dystrophin.

Loss of dystrophin in DMD causes myofiber membrane stress associated myofiber damage when muscles contract. By enhancing muscle stability and decreasing muscle damage, we believe EDG-5506 can potentially improve outcomes across a broader range of DMD patients, vis-à-vis dystrophin replacement gene therapies, when used as a single agent. EDG-5506 may also provide a synergistic or additive effect in combination with available therapies and therapies currently in development, including dystrophin replacement gene therapies.

Disease Background
DMD and BMD are marked by an absence (DMD) or truncation (BMD) of the dystrophin protein resulting from mutations in the dystrophin gene. Approximately 65% of mutations of the DMD gene are deletions of one or several exons, the coding sections of an RNA transcript, or the DNA encoding it, that are ultimately translated into dystrophin protein. Approximately 10% of mutations are duplications of exons and approximately 15% are single point mutations. Depending on whether the specific mutations in the DMD gene maintain the reading frame, dystrophin will or will not be present such that in-frame mutations result in truncated dystrophin and BMD phenotype while out-of-frame or early stop mutations result in no dystrophin and DMD phenotype. Dystrophin provides a structural link between the contractile elements (actin and myosin filaments) of the sarcomere and the basement membrane of the myofibers (muscle cell). Absence of dystrophin leads to myofiber membrane stress during normal sarcomere contraction resulting in an influx of calcium through the myofiber membrane resulting in hypercontraction, irreversible sarcomeric collapse and myofiber degeneration. Myofiber regeneration is possible but appears to fail over time as DMD/BMD patients get older and the muscle stem cell (satellite cell) machinery is exhausted. Fatty and fibrotic tissue then accumulate and replace normal muscle contractile tissue thus compromising function such that patients have progressive and permanent muscle weakness. Circumventing the loss of dystrophin’s structural function may prevent myofiber damage and preserve skeletal muscle function in DMD/BMD.

10



Illustrative mutations in the dystrophin gene and their impact on dystrophin production
DMD and BMD are classified as orphan diseases in the United States and Europe. We estimate that DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and that the patient population is approximately 12,000 to 15,000 in the United States and approximately 25,000 in Europe. BMD has a much lower incidence of approximately 1 in every 18,450 live male births. We estimate there are between 4,000 and 5,000 patients with BMD in the United States, with similar numbers estimated in Europe.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
DMD is a monogenic, X-linked muscle disease secondary to mutations in the dystrophin gene with mortality at a median age of approximately 30 years. DMD pathophysiology is driven by the absence of dystrophin which normally functions as a structural protein in muscle. Once myofiber degeneration is initiated, regeneration typically follows. However, in DMD, the regenerative process appears to fail over time as patients get older leading to fibrosis and progressive loss of muscle function with severe disability and early death.

11



Fibrotic tissue and fatty and inflammatory infiltrate replace myofibers in dystrophic muscle
DMD predominantly occurs in boys and typically presents at three to five years of age through observation of missed functional milestones and Gowers’ sign (a finding from a medical examination that identifies weakness of the proximal hip muscles) due to symmetrical, proximal weakness in selective muscle groups in combination with calf hypertrophy and creatine kinase (CK), a plasma protein biomarker linked to muscle damage, >10 times normal. Systemically circulating biomarkers of myofiber degeneration, such as CK and troponin I are significantly elevated from birth with maximal levels at approximately two years of age. Levels decrease with time, presumably as muscle mass is lost.
Loss of Ambulation
Clinical manifestations occur in a predictable pattern of loss of functional milestones: ability to rise from the floor, ability to climb stairs, ability to walk, upper limb function and respiratory function. Typically, boys begin to lose the ability to rise from the floor between the ages of seven and nine, with the loss of the ability to climb stairs shortly thereafter and loss of ambulation often as early as 10 years of age. Nearly all boys with DMD will require the use of a wheelchair by the time they are young teens.
Impacts on Upper Limb Function
Even while ambulant, loss of upper limb function begins around age eight and continues to decline, with DMD patients struggling to raise their arms above their head in their early teens, which impairs daily activities such as getting clothes on over their head independently or reaching for an object overhead. Loss of upper limb muscle function continues with disease progression, and in their teens patients may lose the ability to independently lift objects to their face, self-feed, use a phone/computer or control a motorized wheelchair. The serious disability due to the loss of key upper limb functions dramatically impacts activities of daily living in DMD patients still in their early teenage years.

12



Effects on Respiratory Function
Respiratory function decline, as measured by spirometry, occurs by age 12, and is generally relentlessly progressive. Progressive respiratory muscle impairment leads to cardiovascular issues and poor respiratory secretion clearance, hypoventilation and pulmonary infections putting patients at increased risk of hospitalization and need of continuous ventilatory support.
Cardiac Complications
The loss of dystrophin leads to cardiovascular disease in most DMD patients. These patients typically develop cardiac features between the ages of 10 and 15 years. The cardiac disease is generally progressive and as cardiac function worsens, patients present with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and clinical heart failure. Since DMD patients in their teens are non-ambulatory, identification of traditional heart failure symptoms is challenging due to relative physical inactivity. Patients with DMD and DCM often report a history of chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, and syncope. Improved care in other specialties, especially respiratory support, has reduced morbidity related to other aspects of DMD but elevated cardiomyopathy as a key driver of mortality.
The Real-World Burden of DMD
Family members and caregivers view DMD not just as a fatal disorder, but a disorder characterized by repeated “little deaths”. Each loss of a functional milestone is excruciating as it represents not a clinical data point to track progression, but one more conversation a parent must have with their child, explaining why they are not allowed to play on the soccer team with their peers, or if they will ever be able to hop, or skip or go to the prom. As the disease progresses, boys lose their ability to toilet, to feed, to dress, to take a bath, all the things that represent independence in a young man’s life. And these losses lead to more symptoms: contractions, pressure sores, constipation, numbness in legs and feet, and scoliosis.
Parents and caregivers devote much of their resources and time to caring for their sons with DMD. All told, these “little deaths” create a family disease with lifelong impacts for all. Perhaps the hardest moment in the life of a DMD family comes in deciding when to tell their young boy that he has this fatal disease.
DMD represents a significant societal and economic burden. The economic burden associated with hospital admissions, medication, frequent doctor visits and investment in assistive devices, as well as indirect costs related to productivity losses for the caregivers and costs due to pain, anxiety and social handicap are estimated at $278 million in Germany, $154 million in Italy, $200 million in the United Kingdom, and $1.2 billion in the United States annually. The impact on parents of children with DMD is also quite dramatic and often requires them to stop working altogether to care for their children who progressively require more help with everyday tasks.
Becker Muscular Dystrophy
In contrast to DMD, BMD results from an in-frame mutation in the dystrophin gene yielding a partially functional protein. BMD patients often are diagnosed at a later age in childhood (approximately 11 years old) with similar symptoms to DMD of symmetrical, proximal limb weakness, notable in the quadriceps, with calf hypertrophy and elevated CK. Progression can be variable and often slower than DMD with mean age of loss of ambulation in the late 30’s and a select few remaining ambulatory into their 50’s or beyond. While certain BMD patients with have a mild or minimal lower limb weakness and remain relatively stable over time as measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), other BMD patients have a typical BMD disease course with progressive loss of lower limb function, measurable with the NSAA over a 12-month period with the majority losing ambulation at some point in their lifetime. Compared to DMD, BMD patients’ skeletal myopathy occurs later in childhood, and they maintain ambulation through age 16. However, BMD patients develop cardiomyopathy at a similar mean age to DMD (14.4 years DMD and 14.6 years BMD). BMD patients may experience worse cardiomyopathy symptoms than DMD patients because BMD patients are ambulatory longer and can perform more motor function such that symptoms of cardiomyopathy may be more readily detectable with exertion, while DMD patients will uniformly be non-ambulatory in the teenage years. BMD patients with cardiac failure commonly have mean life expectancy of 40 to 65 years old.

Comparison of DMD and BMD

Current Treatments for DMD and BMD and their Limitations
There is no cure for DMD and for most patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Standard of care in DMD includes physical therapy to maintain mobility and prevent contractures, bracing and surgery for scoliosis, medical treatment for cardiomyopathy and heart failure, respiratory therapies for ventilatory impairment, psychosocial management to support behavior and learning, glucocorticoid regimens and exon skipping therapies.
Glucocorticoids
The chronic and ongoing damage state seen in DMD is one of the targets of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid treatment with either prednisone or EMFLAZA (deflazacort), the current standard-of-care for DMD, has been shown to temporarily improve muscle strength, prolong the period of ambulation and slow the functional decline, including upper limb and respiratory function, characteristic of the disease. The modest chronic benefit of steroids, weighed against the risks, limits utilization to a relatively narrow age range since initiation of treatment prior to age four is not recommended and treatment is discontinued after loss of ambulation. Sustained glucocorticoid dosing in young DMD patients is associated with side effects including weight gain which could lead to obesity, Cushingoid features, excessive growth of hair on the body, adverse behavior changes, growth impairment, delayed puberty, immune suppression, adrenal suppression, fractures and cataracts.
Exon Skipping Therapies
There are four FDA conditionally-approved antisense oligonucleotide (AO) therapies, each limited to a specific mutation and a subset of the patient population: EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen), approved for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to Exon 51 skipping, AMONDYS 45 (casimersen), approved for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to Exon 45 skipping and VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) and VILTEPSO (vitolarsen), both approved for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to Exon 53 skipping. An aggregate of approximately 29% of DMD patients are amenable to treatment with these therapies. The FDA labels for all four drugs state that a clinical benefit has not yet been established and that continued approval may be contingent upon the verification of such clinical benefit in confirmatory clinical trials. In addition, Translarna® (ataluren), a small molecule intended to promote ribosomal read-through to overcome the 

14



nonsense (stop) pathogenic mutations in DMD, was granted approval by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Israel, South Korea and conditional approval granted by the EMA within the European Union (EU) Member States to treat DMD caused by a nonsense variant in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. However, Phase 3 trials have not confirmed clinical efficacy and Translarna® is not approved for treating DMD in the United States. All five of these approved products seek to address DMD through exon skipping, but we believe their limited observed efficacy is due to poor muscle penetration and biodistribution. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45, in addition to requiring weekly intravenous infusions, have demonstrated a less than 1% mean increase in dystrophin in clinical trials, which we believe is a function of poor and inefficient muscle transduction. Moreover, a significant limitation of exon skipping approaches for DMD is the fact that each AO has been developed for skipping of a specific exon and their use is limited to a sub-set of mutations and hence only used in a subpopulation of DMD patients (e.g., exon 51 skipping is feasible in only up to 13% of all DMD patients). Other companies, such as Avidity Biosciences, Inc., Dyne Therapeutics, Inc. and Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. are working to improve on the muscle delivery aspects of AOs but suffer from the same limitations of first-generation AOs in that they will be restricted to specific, genetically defined DMD subsets. Data suggests that with all exon skipping approaches, the best treatment outcome that DMD patients can expect is a Becker-like disease phenotype.
Gene Therapy for DMD
The lack of dystrophin in patients with DMD has long been a target for adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy but the limited packaging capacity of AAV vectors (4.7 kilo-bases) and the large size of the dystrophin gene (2.2 mega-bases, >400 times bigger than the AAV vector itself) remain a challenge to delivering a fully functional dystrophin protein to patients. As such, the field has shifted to the use of miniaturized dystrophin or microdystrophin expression cassettes that yield a smaller, less complete version of the dystrophin protein as the therapeutic payload; current constructs express truncated dystrophin proteins that are 20% to 30% of the normal size of the full-length dystrophin protein.
Recently, a number of gene therapies designed to produce a minidystrophin or microdystrophin have progressed into clinical development. However, it is estimated that between 20% to 60% of patients have antibodies against AAV due to naturally acquired infections. These antibodies prevent them from receiving AAV gene therapy due to pre-existing AAV immunity to the capsid, the protein shell of the virus used for delivery, which can lead to severe and potentially deadly immune response. The duration of activity and utility/safety of these approaches in older patients is also an open question.
The question around whether gene expression can persist lifelong after a single vector administration is an area of debate across many disorders including dystrophinopathies. The long-term persistence of transgene expression is exacerbated by preexisting or recall immune responses to the AAV vector capsid and/or to the transgene product itself, which can interfere with therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, this limited durability is problematic because re-administration after the first dose is currently not possible.
The current gene therapies for DMD also have strict age cut offs for patient eligibility. Both Pfizer and Sarepta Therapeutics have limited their Phase 3 patient enrollment to children aged four to seven years old, thus excluding a significant proportion of DMD children and adolescents. Due to weight-based dosing regimens, for older patients in particular, who are generally heavier, scaling up to produce enough AAV-based viral vector genomic particles or vector genomes, remains a potentially significant encumbrance and even if feasible, raises concerns relating to safety of administering higher viral loads to patients. It is important to note that multiple clinical trials have reported significant adverse events associated with systemic administration of higher doses of AAV to treat muscle diseases. Vector dilution will also be an important consideration that we believe will limit the current class of AAV-based gene therapies to the age groups studied in their respective trials. We anticipate that treatment with AAVs engineered to deliver mini or micro dystrophin in younger patients will lead to a dilution of the transcript with age and normal growth; thus, children are unlikely to express dystrophin as their disease progresses and they become symptomatic and non-ambulatory.
Even if minidystrophin or microdystrophin gene therapy for DMD is successful, we believe that the best potential therapeutic outcome is inducing a Becker-like phenotype where patients would still have significant residual skeletal 

15



muscle impairment and will thus continue to have a high degree of unmet need. What is clear is that gene therapies currently in development for DMD do not represent a cure for the disease.
We believe that each of the therapeutic approaches outlined above currently have significant limitations, and that there continues to be a high unmet medical need for new disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of patients with DMD. Moreover, with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry’s almost exclusive focus on DMD, little attention has been paid to drug development in BMD where there are no approved therapies for patients.
Our Solution: EDG-5506
Since the cloning of the dystrophin gene in 1986, researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have worked relentlessly to advance the scientific and clinical understanding of DMD to accelerate finding a cure. At Edgewise, we have built on top of this foundational work through applying our understanding of muscle physiology to develop EDG-5506, a molecule that we believe has the potential to change the devastating course of DMD. While many of our competitors are targeting dystrophin, our orthogonal approach is focused on protecting muscle damage induced by contractions from activities of daily living.
EDG-5506 is an orally administered, allosteric, selective, fast myofiber (type II) myosin inhibitor that is designed to be inactive against slow myofiber (type I) myosin present in both skeletal muscle and the heart. We believe EDG-5506 has the potential to overcome many of the obstacles facing other therapeutics in development for the treatment of dystrophinopathies based on the following key characteristics:

● | Offers a novel, potentially disease modifying approach for the treatment of rare muscle diseases by blocking the structural destabilization of skeletal myofibers. By protecting dystrophin deficient myofibers from degeneration, EDG-5506’s mechanism of action is directed towards the underlying cause of muscle degeneration in DMD and BMD to reduce muscle damage, prevent downstream fibrosis, allow healthy muscle contraction and enhance physical function. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly selective for all fast type II myofibers thus limiting the potential for serious off-target side effects. Our non-clinical toxicology package has not revealed any off-target or unexpected side effects, following systemic administration. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targeted distribution into muscle tissue limits exposure to other organs. EDG-5506 exhibits a high volume of distribution due to target-mediated partition into skeletal muscle. This reduces exposure of the compound to other organs such as the liver and kidney, limiting the chances of unexpected adverse effects. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offers a mutation agnostic approach with the potential to be used for disorders resulting from genetic lesions in dystrophin or the sarcoglycan complex. EDG-5506 can potentially be used to treat all populations of DMD and BMD, as well as LGMD, a progressive, lethal myopathy that results from mutations of key proteins in the sarcoglycan complex. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provides a mechanistic approach to treat DMD that may provide additional functional benefits over genetic based therapeutics. DNA based gene therapies or RNA based exon skipping therapeutics are designed to produce a mini- or micro-dystrophin but not a full-length dystrophin protein; therefore, the best potential therapeutic outcome for these therapies might be a Becker-like phenotype where patients would still have significant skeletal muscle impairments and high degree of unmet need. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offers a potential treatment option to patients, regardless of therapy background, immune background, age or weight. We are developing EDG-5506 to be used as a single agent therapy but it may also provide a synergistic or additive effect in combination with available therapies and therapies currently in development. Moreover, EDG-5506 may offer a disease modifying option for patients currently excluded from Phase 3

We believe these characteristics uniquely position EDG-5506 as a potentially new standard of care for patients with DMD and BMD, either as a standalone or in combination with other therapies.
An illustration of EDG-5506’s novel mechanism of action
Background and Rationale of Our Approach
Human skeletal muscle consists of three fiber types, “slow” type I and “fast” types IIa or IIx/d, defined by the specific myosin isoform that they express. Studies have shown that fast muscle fibers are more susceptible to injury in both healthy individuals and in DMD. Histological studies of young DMD patients document distinct fiber-type imbalances in the co-localization of fast and embryonic myosin, a marker of regenerating muscle fibers. Similar observations have also been made in all known mammalian models of DMD. The control and coordination of these fiber populations is a complex process, designed to maintain physical performance even under conditions of extreme environmental and metabolic stress. Under normal conditions, skeletal muscle contractile demand is much lower than at the maximal output. Maximal activation of muscle is painful, damaging and unproductive to sustained function. We have taken advantage of this flexibility to explore an alternative therapeutic strategy to protect susceptible type II skeletal muscle fibers.

17



Properties of skeletal muscle fiber types: slow (type I) and fast (type II) fibers
When muscle fibers undergo damage, they release internal proteins such as CK (A) and troponin into the blood. One of the troponin subunits, TnI has a different isoform for each type of striated muscle (fast, slow and cardiac) and can be used to explore the fiber-specific source of these proteins. We evaluated DMD and BMD patient plasma samples using high specificity assays for fast and slow myofiber TnI and observed that fast myofiber TnI (TnI2) plasma levels (B) are higher than slow myofiber TnI (TnI1) levels (C), suggesting that fast myofibers are more susceptible to loss of dystrophin function during muscle contraction. Conversely, we observed that HVs had virtually no leak from fast muscles (B).
Biomarkers of fast fiber turnover are elevated in BMD and DMD
Using high-throughput screens of type II fast skeletal muscle myofibrils, we identified a novel structural class of myosin ATPase inhibitors that we optimized for potency, selectivity, physiochemical properties and PK, leading to the synthesis of EDG-5506. EDG-5506 acts to protect dystrophic muscle from breakdown by modulating contraction in susceptible fast muscle fibers. Our goal is to reduce contraction of susceptible muscle fibers by five to twenty percent. 

18



We believe that the reduced muscle breakdown will result in potential preservation or enhancement of physical function in DMD patients.
Regulating myofiber contraction in DMD patients is not a novel concept. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of the ryanodine receptor that modulates both fast and slow skeletal myofiber contraction was used in a small clinical trial in 1991 in DMD patients. Treatment was associated with a 3-fold reduction in CK and a trend favoring attenuation of decreases in function. While it is approved for treatment of malignant hyperthermia and chronic spasticity, it is not approved or used in DMD. Chronic treatment with dantrolene has been associated with drowsiness and the potentially serious side effect of idiosyncratic fatal hepatotoxicity, limiting its broad use. We anticipate that the high potency, fast fiber targeting and low projected dose of EDG-5506 will limit unwanted side effects. Moreover, stabilization of the sarcomere for the most damage-susceptible muscle fibers in DMD with EDG-5506 potentially provides greater muscle protection than inhibition of calcium release via the ryanodine receptor.
Another corollary to our approach of selectively targeting type II fast skeletal muscle myofibrils with EDG-5506 is mavacamten (MYK-461), a selective allosteric inhibitor of cardiac type I myosin ATPase. Mavacamten is currently under review by the FDA for possible approval for HCM, a disorder characterized by excessive contractility and impaired relaxation of cardiomyocytes. Through selective targeting of cardiac type I myosin ATPase, mavacamten is designed to reduce cardiac muscle hypercontractility in HCM. Mavacamten’s mechanism of action further validates selective allosteric regulation of myofibers as a viable therapeutic approach to treating various muscle disorders.
Interestingly, nature has carried out one of the more critical experiments to help us understand the impact of inhibiting fast fiber myosin selectively. There are several reports describing the human phenotype of people born with genetic loss of function (LOF) of the myosin heavy chain 2 gene, MYH2. Muscle biopsies in these patients show a heavy skewing towards slow type I muscle fibers as a result of complete lack of fast type II muscle fibers. These patients have mild, proximal muscle weakness with ocular muscle involvement but remain ambulatory throughout life. The observations in these patients demonstrate an ability of the body to maintain function despite complete loss of one myofiber type. Given that our goal is to only partially inhibit type II fast skeletal muscle myofibrils in order to modulate force development and not completely inhibit them, as is the case in the LOF patients, it is our belief that selective fast fiber regulation with EDG-5506 will likely be well-tolerated and may protect dystrophic myofibers from degeneration and subsequently improve and/or preserve physical function.
Preclinical Data
In Vitro Biochemical and Single Muscle Fiber Assays
The inhibitory activity and specificity of EDG-5506 was measured using skeletal myofibril preparations isolated from muscle sources with uniform myosin composition. We observed that EDG-5506 inhibited fast myofibril ATPase from rabbit psoas muscle with an IC50 of 0.2 µM (A). Myosin inhibitory activity was further supported by measuring the actin-activated ATPase of purified S1 myosin motor sub-fragment. We observed that EDG-5506 inhibited the enzymatic activity of fast, but not cardiac or the more unrelated smooth muscle S1, with an IC50 of 0.11 µM and >100 µM, respectively (B and C). We also observed that EDG-5506 selectively reduced contraction in fast skeletal muscle fibers with an IC50 of 0.7 µM (D). In contrast, maximal inhibitory concentrations of EDG-5506 had no observed effect on slow skeletal or cardiac muscle fibers (E and F). In ex vivo assays using mouse muscle, we observed that EDG-5506 reduced contraction in a concentration and time-dependent manner, completely inhibiting fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle but only partially inhibiting mixed fast/slow soleus muscle.

19

Protection of Dystrophic Skeletal Muscle from Contraction-induced Functional Decline
The inhibitory activity of EDG-5506 in live skeletal muscle ex vivo was measured in wild type (WT) mouse EDL muscle, a predominantly fast skeletal muscle in the hindlimb. We observed that the addition of EDG-5506 to isolated muscle resulted in concentration- and time-dependent decreases in maximal force (A). EDL muscles from dystrophic mdx mice exhibited enhanced force run-down with eccentric (lengthening) contraction. We also observed that the addition of 5 µM EDG-5506 to mdx EDL muscle for 60 minutes (enough to decrease pre-injury maximal force by 50%) decreased peak force decline closer to that observed in WT mouse muscle (B). Protection with EDG-5506 exhibited a concentration dependent response with 50% of maximal protection at approximately 1 µM, associated with an approximately 10% decrease in force at the time of the injury (C).

20



EDG-5506 protected dystrophic skeletal muscle from contraction-induced functional decline ex vivo
In situ muscle tests were next performed on intact mdx mouse TA muscle, with contraction elicited via sciatic nerve stimulation and force measured from a tendon at the ankle of the mouse under anesthesia. In this model, contracting muscle is rapidly lengthened, resulting in excessive stress that causes an amplified decrease in the ability of the muscle to contract after the injury in mdx but not normal mice. We observed that oral doses of EDG-5506 caused dose-dependent decreases in muscle force prior to lengthening injury (A). After lengthening injury, we observed that EDG-5506 prevented exaggerated force deficits, returning the injury response in mdx mice to that of a normal mouse (B). Importantly, we observed that full protection of the muscle was possible with only small decreases in force prior to injury (<10% — compare force decrease in (A) with protection in (B)).

21



EDG-5506 protected dystrophic skeletal muscle from contraction-induced functional decline in situ
Protection of Dystrophic Skeletal Muscle from membrane disruption
In conjunction with exaggerated force deficits, exercise of dystrophic skeletal muscle triggers membrane disruption that results in edema, entry of extracellular calcium ions and necrosis. Fluid entry was visualized in mdx mouse muscle ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo imaging was performed by incubating mdx extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle with procion orange, a membrane impermeable dye. We observed that lengthening contraction of muscle led to increased uptake of the dye, which was visualized with immunofluorescence (A). We also observed that preincubation of muscles with EDG-5506 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in procion-positive fibers (B).
Muscle membrane leak was separately visualized in vivo by intravenous injection of Evans blue dye (EBD), which is only taken up by disrupted muscle fibers and marks them with a blue color. Mdx mice were administered vehicle or EDG-5506 daily for three weeks before EBD injection. Mice were then sacrificed 24 hours later, and blue fibers visualized after removal of the skin (C). We observed that EDG-5506 dramatically lowered the appearance of blue muscle fibers (examples marked with red arrows), close to that observed in healthy normal mice. We believe these observations further support EDG-5506’s ability to protect muscles from membrane disruption and edema.

22



EDG-5506 reduced muscle membrane disruption in mdx mice
Protection of dystrophic skeletal muscle from exercise-induced injury
Exercise was next used to induce exaggerated muscle injury in mdx mice. Exercise in mdx mice yields membrane injury which causes muscle proteins, including CK, to leak from muscle into the circulation. Mdx mice were administered a single dose of vehicle or EDG-5506 and were physically challenged with a grip strength test device four hours later. We observed that EDG-5506 had no detrimental effect on grip strength performance (A)  but that circulating CK activity after the exercise was significantly lower than that shown in disease controls (B). This study demonstrated that therapeutic muscle protection in vivo is possible without inhibiting myosin to a level that decreases strength. It is worth noting that this type of single-dose challenge experiment was not expected to demonstrate strength improvements but instead was used as a strength challenge to elicit muscle injury.

23



EDG-5506 protected muscle from exercise-induced injury in mdx mice
Improvements in strength and diaphragm fibrosis in mdx mice after eight weeks oral administration of EDG-5506
Longer term effects of EDG-5506 were assessed in young mdx mice after eight weeks of administration. EDG-5506 treated mice exhibited higher grip strength compared to vehicle treated mice (A). At the end of the study, continued muscle protection was observed with a rotarod exercise challenge. There was no observed difference in rotarod performance (B), but CK was observed to be lower in the treated groups compared to vehicle, consistent with single-dose results (C). While DMD patients exhibit extensive muscle fibrosis with age, collagen accumulation in mdx mice is generally limited to the diaphragm. Histological examination of the diaphragm using a collagen stain (picrosirius red) revealed lower staining in EDG-5506 treated mice (example images D, calculated area E).

24



EDG-5506 improved strength and diaphragm fibrosis after 8 weeks treatment of dystrophic mdx mice
Improvements in fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and kyphosis in the DBA/2J mdx mouse model of DMD
Unlike DMD patients, the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse on the C57BL/10 genetic background (B10.mdx) is mildly affected by disease with limited muscle fibrosis. A more severe muscle disease is observed when the mdx mutation is crossed onto the DBA/2J genetic background (D2.mdx). This model exhibits greater muscle damage, impaired muscle regeneration, muscle wasting, and exacerbated progression of intramuscular fibrosis than age matched B10.mdx mice. Given that the DBA/2J mdx mouse phenotype better recapitulates characteristics of the human disease, we evaluated the effect of EDG-5506 on skeletal muscle fibrosis in this mouse model.
We observed that twelve weeks EDG-5506 dosing via incorporated chow at 50 ppm (roughly equivalent to 1 mg/kg per day by oral administration) in DBA/2J mdx mice starting at five weeks old reduced fibrosis in anterior tibialis (TA) muscle and diaphragm muscles (A, B) with a trend towards lower fibrosis in the left ventricle of the heart (C).

25



EDG-5506 reduced muscle fibrosis in DBA/2J mdx mice after 12 weeks treatment
Unexpected trends in the reduction of cardiac fibrosis led us to examine DBA/2J mdx mice in two studies after longer term (12 to 15 months) dosing. At the end of the study in 15-month-old mice, we performed a whole-body examination of musculoskeletal anatomy after removing the skin in euthanized mice. Skeletal muscles were noticeably smaller in the fore and hindlimbs of DBA/2J mdx mice and kyphosis (spinal curvature) was visible when compared to control DBA 2/J mice (blue arrows). We observed that treatment with EDG-5506 for 14 months dramatically prevented muscle loss and kyphosis (green arrows). This observation is particularly meaningful as scoliosis can be observed in older DMD patients following loss of ambulation. Scoliosis coupled with diaphragm fibrosis drives respiratory failure and is a significant cause of death in DMD patients.

26



EDG-5506 dramatically prevents kyphosis in DBA/2J mdx mice
Consistent with shorter term studies, we also observed significant reductions in gastrocnemius muscle fibrosis along with significant improvements in muscle weight (A). Diaphragm fibrosis was not observed to be lowered with longer term treatment (B), but the incidence of lipid vacuole deposition (red arrows) was observed to be significantly lowered with treatment. Fatty tissue deposition is common in older DMD patients, in conjunction with fibrosis.
EDG-5506 improved skeletal muscle fibrosis and atrophy in DBA/2J mdx long-term studies
Improvements in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in DBA/2J mdx long-term studies
Longer term dosing of DBA/2J mdx mice also demonstrated lower cardiac fibrosis compared to vehicle controls in both long term studies (A, B). We also observed a reduction in the incidence of cardiac hypertrophy (C). Observing cardiac benefit in DBA/2J mdx mice is uncommon and has not been demonstrated in long-term studies with high level AAV micro-dystrophin transduction. As the heart is not a direct target of EDG-5506, we believe the mechanism of this benefit is indirect via improvement of skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm. Given that cardiac myopathy is a common driver of mortality in both DMD and BMD, we believe that this is a significant and clinically relevant finding.

27

Reversible decreases in circulating muscle injury biomarkers following EDG-5506 administration in Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs
Mouse models of DMD recapitulate many features of disease but they are enriched for fast fibers, develop only localized muscle fibrosis and do not exhibit functional deficits until relatively late in life. In contrast, dogs have muscle that has similar proportions of fast and slow fibers (approximately 50/50) compared to humans and weakness/functional deficits with age that more closely resemble DMD patients. Amongst the dog models of DMD, the GRMD dogs are the largest and most severely affected. GRMD dogs tend to be weak at birth and then stabilize at two weeks of age before progressive muscle damage, inflammation and pseudo-hypertrophy, particularly of the flexor muscles of the limbs causing physical weakness. Unlike DMD patients, GRMD dogs remain ambulatory and disease symptoms stabilize at six months of age, at which age their muscle histology is similar to that of a 10-year-old DMD patient.
Four disease-stable dystrophin deficient female GRMD dogs (seven months old) were dosed daily with vehicle for one week and then with EDG-5506 (3 mg/kg loading dose for two to three days, then 1 mg/kg daily) for two weeks before a six-day washout period. CK was reversibly decreased >50% with EDG-5506 (A).

28



Circulating CK levels correlate with activity in GRMD dogs. In a follow-up study, (same dogs, 18 months of age), we tested whether administration of EDG-5506 affected activity using an activity monitor. We observed that EDG-5506 improved average daily activity by >30% (B), increased active time and decreased rest time in a reversible manner demonstrating both reduction in CK and improved physical function. To our knowledge, this is the first documented intervention to improve biomarkers and physical function in symptomatic, disease stable GRMD dogs. Our studies demonstrating consistent beneficial effects of EDG-5506 across multiple established preclinical models is differentiated and we believe speaks to the fundamental nature of our novel approach.
EDG-5506 decreased circulating injury biomarkers and improved activity in GRMD dogs
EDG-5506 lowered disease biomarkers in DMD dogs as measured by SOMAscan
We used a SOMAscan aptamer-based high-throughput proteomics platform to determine if other proteins, beyond CK, change in plasma in response to treatment with EDG-5506. As expected, GRMD control plasma samples exhibited many protein differences compared to healthy dogs, reflecting the serious skeletal muscle pathology of these animals. EDG-5506 successfully restored the GRMD plasma protein signature closer to that of WT dogs, reversibly lowering elevated proteins and increasing downregulated proteins. A closer examination of proteins significantly lowered by treatment with EDG-5506 validated previous CK activity measures (muscle CK reversibly lowered 34%, p<0.05). Gene ontology (GO) term analysis also revealed decreases in cellular pathways commonly associated with dystrophic muscle including apoptotic, cellular signaling, metabolic and immune responses.
SOMAscan analysis of patient plasma has previously been used to generate a common serum protein signature for DMD. As such, we compared EDG-5506’s response fingerprint in GRMD to DMD patient data. Comparison with GRMD baseline samples revealed a set of 40 elevated and nine depleted proteins overlapping with the DMD patient signature. The SOMAscan analysis showed that EDG-5506 significantly and reversibly altered blood concentrations away from the DMD patient signature profile during the dosing period.

Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of EDG-5506
In all species studied to date, concentration-time profiles resulting from bolus intravenous administration are characterized by rapid distribution phase followed by mono-exponential decay. EDG-5506 displayed a terminal half-life ranging from 21 to 69 hours across species. The compound distributes to skeletal muscle, its intended therapeutic target, with high skeletal tissue to plasma ratios. Distribution to cardiac muscle is minimal and tends to be on the order of 2-fold plasma levels. High absolute oral bioavailability was observed across species when presented as a solution or highly dispersed suspension.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) reaction phenotyping studies using recombinant enzymes have identified several isoforms that are involved in EDG-5506 metabolism, including CYP3A4, 2D6, and 2C19. Drug-drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes conducted at concentrations up to 30 µM did not indicate reversible inhibition of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Similarly, EDG-5506 did not display measurable inhibition in time-dependent studies in the same panel of CYPs.
EDG-5506 has been administered to mouse, rat, dog, pig and monkey by intravenous and oral administration, the intended route of administration in humans, to project human PK parameters using simple allometry.
EDG-5506 Toxicology Studies
The toxicity and safety pharmacology profile of EDG-5506 has been explored in standard good laboratory practice (GLP) safety pharmacology studies, in non-good laboratory practice exploratory and dose range studies. 13-week repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in rat and dog to support the Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial. Additionally, a 26-week oral GLP toxicity study of EDG-5506 in rats and a 39-week oral GLP toxicity study of EDG-5506 in dogs were performed to support longterm dosing in humans. All toxicities noted were ascribed to EDG-5506 and were consistent with the known mechanism of EDG-5506 and exaggerated primary PD activity (i.e., regulation of type II fast skeletal muscle myosin). There were no unanticipated off-target toxicities noted in either rats or dogs administered EDG 5506 for up to 39 weeks. We expect to receive the results of a 7-week oral juvenile toxicity study in 2022.

EDG-5506 Formulation
EDG-5506 is formulated as a powder for suspension in a commercially available compounding agent, SyrSpend® SF (sugar free), for once daily oral administration. This allows EDG-5506 to be administered to young children. SyrSpend® SF is a sweetened, suspending vehicle for use in compounded oral liquid preparations. SyrSpend® SF is composed of modified food starch, citric acid, sucralose, and sodium citrate. All ingredients are “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) or classified as “inactive ingredients” by the FDA when used in accordance with their intended purpose. As EDG-5506 is a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) Class 1 molecule, it can be readily formulated into solid dosage forms including tablets and capsules.
EDG-5506 Clinical Plan
An updated overview of our near-term clinical development plan for EDG-5506 in DMD and BMD is shown below. 
​
EDG-5506 Phase 1 Clinical Trial
In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending-dose clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of EDG-5506 in adult HVs (Phase 1a) and adults with BMD (Phase 1b), to address potential differences in safety, tolerability and PK in the background of dystrophic muscle. The starting dose in the SAD was informed by the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) from the 13-week GLP toxicology study. The Phase 1 clinical trial was carried out at a single site in San Antonio, Texas. 

31



EDG-5506 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Schematic
Phase 1a: Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Cohorts
In the first-in-human single ascending dose (SAD) trial, oral doses of EDG-5506 (0.5, 1.5, 5, 15, 45, 90 and 135 mg) or matching placebo were administered to 57 HVs — cohorts of eight participants were randomized to six receiving EDG-5506 and two receiving a placebo for each dose group. A single dose of EDG-5506 up to 90 mg was considered generally safe and well-tolerated. The most common AEs were dizziness and somnolence, which was seen at Grade 1 (on the Division of AIDS AE Grading Scale) except in the single dose cohort of 135 mg, where Grade II somnolence and dizziness were observed. 
Phase 1a Events
​
Our SAD demonstrated rapid absorption of EDG-5506 following a single oral dose. EDG-5506 displayed a favorable human PK profile, consistent with extensive on-target muscle distribution and a half-life of approximately 15 days. Exposures were observed to be dose proportional up to the 45 mg dose. PK modeling utilizing the SAD dataset projected that once-daily doses of 10-15 mg will achieve steady-state Ctrough drug concentrations at or above the efficacy exposure levels achieved in preclinical dystrophic models. 

32



Phase 1a single dose PKs in HVs
​
As part of the first in human clinical trial, we also explored EDG-5506’s ability to inhibit involuntary quadriceps twitch force, a direct marker of target engagement. Using a trans-magnetic device to stimulate involuntary leg contraction via a probe placed over the top of the leg, muscle force was then measured via a force transducer connected to the ankle. This novel experimental measure has not been used previously in an interventional trial. Our goal was to derive a relationship between dose, plasma exposure and involuntary twitch force inhibition after administration of EDG-5506 in healthy volunteers. 
Proof of mechanism was demonstrated by dose dependent PD activity at doses of 45 mg and above, with each dose cohort clearly differentiated from placebo. EDG-5506’s robust PD effect in humans was observed at exposures similar to those seen at efficacious levels in preclinical disease models. The time course of peak PD activity (10 hours post dosing) was substantially separated from the onset of somnolence (approximately 30 minutes post dosing). The effect was reversed within 48 hours post dosing. Onset of the PD effect was consistent with preclinical observations of steady-state redistribution to the gastrocnemius muscle in rodents. Importantly, EDG-5506 was not found to affect voluntary skeletal muscle function, as assessed by handgrip strength testing, nor was it found to negatively impact alternate forms of myosin elsewhere in the body (e.g., cardiac or slow muscle). These observations provide preliminary evidence of a dose dependent change in a biomarker of fast myosin regulation following a single dose of EDG-5506. The magnitude of the effect was in line with force reductions required to prevent muscle degeneration in preclinical experiments with dystrophic mice. Moreover, human exposures at 10 hours were consistent with steady state concentrations observed in preclinical efficacy studies. 
Phase 1a: Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Cohorts
The MAD enrolled 40 participants of whom 30 were randomized to EDG-5506 and 10 were randomized to placebo. Cohorts B1 and B2 received a suspension with a 4-day loading dose of EDG-5506 once-daily followed by 10 days at half of this dose (B1: 10 mg/5 mg, B2: 20 mg/10 mg). Generally, cohorts B3 to B5 did not receive a loading dose and were administered a 20 mg suspension (B3) or a solid dosage form at doses of 20 mg (B4) and 40 mg (B5) daily for 14 days.

33



The study drug was well tolerated in all multi-dose cohorts (5 to 40 mg EDG-5506 given once daily for 14 days). Overall, 30 of 40 (75%) enrolled subjects experienced treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) which were all Grade 1. Dizziness and somnolence were the most common AEs experienced and in all cases were mild and transient. At projected therapeutic doses, AEs generally decreased over time suggesting development of tolerance. There were no AEs of special interest, no SAEs, and no discontinuations due to AEs. There were no AEs due to clinically significant abnormal vital signs, ECG or laboratory assessments. Hand grip strength testing was serially measured with no significant change seen in any MAD participants. 
In the MAD, the PKs on Day 1 were consistent with the PKs observed in the SAD part of the study with rapid absorption for the suspension formulation (Cohorts B1-B3). Variability observed in exposure parameters tends to decrease over time as drug accumulates with moderate variability on Day 14 consistent with filling of the muscle compartment. Cohorts B3 and B4 (20 mg once-daily for 14 days) allowed for the direct PK comparison of the suspension (SS) formulation and the solid dosage form (SD). The AUC0-24 and C24 PK parameters were similar between the two cohorts on Days 1 and 14. Accumulation ratios were also similar between the cohorts indicating similar absorption of drug. However, Cmax was lower in the solid dosage form by approximately 50-75% on each of the 3 days on which extensive PK sampling was done (1, 4, and 14).

Multiple Oral once-daily Doses for 14 Days in Healthy Volunteers
​
As already outlined in the preclinical section, we have made significant efforts to understand the pharmacology of EDG 5506, its general tolerability and its ability to improve symptoms of disease in a variety of models of muscular dystrophy. An additional and important goal was to also provide a range of compound concentrations required to achieve efficacy and translate those levels to meaningful target muscle exposures in humans. To achieve this, we focused on measuring absolute muscle concentrations in preclinical studies and then calculated a human target equivalent muscle exposure, based on relative proportions of fast muscle fibers (see figure below).

34



EDG-5506 Target Human Muscle Exposure Range
As shown, EDG-5506 human muscle levels of 1,000 to 4,100 ng/g were projected to provide meaningful clinical benefit in humans based on experiments in mdx, DBA/2J mdx and GRMD. Of note, muscle concentrations in mouse studies were those required for maximal efficacy, essentially returning dystrophic muscle to a normal state.
In the MAD cohorts, muscle biopsy samples were taken at Day 14 to measure EDG-5506 levels in muscle. In Cohorts B1-B5, EDG-5506 concentrates in muscle at or above levels predicted to provide meaningful clinical benefit in humans (summarized below). Mean EDG-5506 concentration was two orders of magnitude higher concentrations in the muscle tissue versus plasma, which we believe reflects the known high-affinity binding to myosin in fast muscle fibers. This observation was key as it demonstrated EDG-5506 achieves muscle concentrations believed to be needed in the clinic in order to demonstrate efficacy. 
Muscle EDG-5506 Concentrations in Cohorts B1-B5
The pharmacodynamic effect of EDG-5506 was once again measured using the Magstim trans-magnetic device. Findings from the MAD cohorts showed that not only is EDG-5506 reaching the fast muscle fibers but that EDG-5506 also leads to a dose dependent and highly statistically significant inhibition of involuntary fast muscle fiber twitch, the precise target of EDG-5506. Importantly there was no impact on voluntary muscle function.

35



In summary, the Phase 1a SAD/MAD demonstrated that EDG-5506 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed. PK data supports robust target engagement with achievement of muscle concentrations well above the efficacious levels observed in preclinical disease models. Moreover, EDG-5506 PD data showed a dose-dependent effect on involuntary twitch response in healthy volunteers, reflecting robust target engagement. Based on these observations, a 20 mg solid dosage form was selected for the Becker muscular dystrophy patients in the Phase 1b trial.
Phase 1b: Becker Muscular Dystrophy Cohort (Part C)
Cohort C1 enrolled seven adult males with BMD who were randomized to active (n=5) or placebo (n=2). EDG-5506 was administered at a dose of 20 mg once daily, in solid dosage form taken with food for 14 days. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints were PK, including tissue concentrations, and, importantly, multiple biomarkers of muscle damage in the setting of dystrophic muscle. 
BMD patients in the Phase 1b were required to be ambulatory with no exclusions based on functional criteria. An overview of the BMD patient demographics is shown below. For the functional measures the median value for the 10 m walk run was over double the age normative value and the median rise from floor was 20 seconds with three participants being unable to complete the test (unaffected adults typically have a value of <3 seconds). Serum creatinine was approximately half of the expected range, consistent with decreased muscle mass, while serum CK was a multiple of normal values consistent with ongoing muscle damage in these individuals.
BMD Phase 1b Patient Demographics
​
​
Unsurprisingly, the quadriceps in the BMD patients demonstrated significant damage as determined by the lack of a detectable signal in response to Magstim and thus an inability to measure a change in twitch response with EDG-5506.  Moreover, the grip strength in BMD patients was also impaired to approximately 60% of normal grip strength. 

36



Baseline Magstim and Hand Grip Strength in BMD Cohort
EDG-5506 was well tolerated in BMD subjects. Seven of the seven subjects enrolled in the Phase 1b cohort experienced TEAEs and all were Grade 1. There were no AEs of special interest, no SAEs, and no discontinuations due to AEs. There were no AEs due to clinically significant abnormal vital signs, ECG or laboratory assessments. All participants that received EDG-5506 experienced Grade 1 dizziness with 2 of 5 participants reporting somnolence (summary below). Hand grip strength testing was serially measured with no significant change seen in BMD participants.

37



Phase 1b Individuals with BMD - Adverse Events
Similar to the MAD cohorts, biopsy samples were taken from the quadriceps of BMD patients at Day 14 to measure EDG-5506 levels in muscle. EDG-5506 muscle concentrations in BMD patients were adjusted to reflect the approximately 60% fat fraction in the quadriceps of these individuals, which was further corroborated by reduced overall protein content, as measured by a standard Bradford protein assay, as well as the cohort’s overall reduced functional status. Relatedly, EDG-5506 plasma concentrations in BMD subjects were approximately two-fold higher than those in healthy volunteers at the same 20 mg dose. This observation is consistent with EDG-5506 being highly targeted to muscle, and reflective of these patient’s overall reduced muscle mass as evidenced by a mean serum creatinine level of 0.58 mg/dL, significantly below a mean value of 1.15 for an age- and sex-matched population.
Dystrophic muscle in BMD patients showed adjusted EDG-5506 levels in the range previously observed in the MAD, demonstrating a similar, high-affinity binding to myosin in fast twitch dystrophic muscles. The muscle levels reached in BMD patients were in the range where multiple preclinical studies with EDG-5506 have shown pharmacological activity in models of DMD. 

38



EDG-5506 Muscle and Plasma Concentration in BMD Patients
​
Muscle injury in muscular dystrophies leads to leaking of several muscle proteins into the circulation, including CK, myoglobin and TNNI2 (see overview of biomarkers below). Serial blood samples were taken from BMD participants for both biochemical analysis of biomarkers of muscle damage and proteomics using the SOMAscan to enable unbiased profiling of elevated plasma proteins and establish a unique BMD disease biomarker fingerprint. 
Biomarkers of Muscle Damage in Muscular Dystrophies
​
After 14 days of treatment with EDG-5506, BMD participants had a significant and rapid decrease in circulating CK of 66%, reflecting a reduction from 5X to 1.6X of the upper limit of normal by the second week of dosing. The low absolute CK levels observed following treatment with EDG-5506 are unprecedented for BMD patients and have not been previously reported for any therapeutics targeting BMD patients. There was also a modest, non-significant and anticipated CK decrease in the placebo group, consistent with BMD patients being confined to a phase 1 clinical study unit and exhibiting an overall reduced level of physical activity – this “natural” reduction in CK has previously been reported for DMD children confined to an in-patient setting. Importantly, following a 4 week washout, CK values rebound back to baseline levels further supporting a strong drug effect.

39



CK Reduction Following EDG-5506 Treatment
​
Additionally, myoglobin levels similarly decreased to near normal levels and aspartate transaminase (AST) dropped to within the normal range in all subjects who received EDG-5506. 

40



Reduction in Myoglobin and AST Following EDG-5506 Treatment
Leveraging the SOMAscan 7,000 analyte set, baseline BMD patient plasma samples (n=7) were compared to baseline samples taken from healthy volunteers (n=25). To establish a unique proteomic signature for individuals with BMD, elevated proteins were filtered by those exhibiting a magnitude of change ≥1.5X and an adjusted p value of <0.05 relative to healthy volunteers (illustrated in red box below). This analysis is the first of its kind to characterize a unique proteomic fingerprint for individuals with BMD. Interestingly, and similar to individuals with DMD, the most significant elevated proteins are from muscle and metabolic pathways enriched in muscle, consistent with leaky damaged muscles.

41



Baseline BMD vs. Healthy Biomarker Fingerprint Analysis with SOMAscan
​
Subsequently, the impact of EDG-5506 treatment on the BMD proteomic fingerprint, was examined. As anticipated, treatment of healthy individuals with 20 mg of EDG-5506 had no impact on the BMD protein signature. In comparison, BMD individuals exhibited a robust, significant and time-dependent decrease in elevated BMD biomarkers compared to placebo after only two weeks of dosing. 

42



Baseline BMD vs. Healthy Biomarker Fingerprint Analysis with SOMAscan
​
The BMD SOMAscan signature showed that CK and TNNI2 both exhibited a robust decrease in response to EDG-5506 treatment compared to placebo treated individuals. Specifically, CK decreased by 71%, similar to the decrease observed in biochemical activity assays, while TNNI2 decreased by 83% with treatment. Both muscle damage biomarkers returned to normal levels observed in healthy individuals following 14-days of treatment with EDG-5506 (see below). Individual SOMAscan measures of CK and TNNI2 showed a tight correlation, as would be expected for proteins that similarly leak from damaged muscles.

43



CK and TNNI2 are Reduced to Levels Observed in HVs Following Treatment with EDG-5506
​
Interestingly, proteins that were most elevated in the BMD signature set were also those that decreased following treatment with EDG-5506. This observation suggests a broad normalization of the proteomic signature of BMD towards a more normal state with EDG-5506 treatment.

44



Correlation Between Elevation of Biomarkers and Response to EDG-5506
The robust reduction in muscle damage biomarkers observed in BMD suggests that EDG-5506 may normalize the excessive stress observed in dystrophic muscle, ultimately preserving muscle function and preventing disease progression in muscular dystrophies. In fact, a comparison of the consensus SOMAscan signature of consistently elevated proteins in DMD showed substantial overlap with those responsive to EDG-5506 treatment in BMD patients after only 14-days of dosing. As such, the positive observations in BMD are likely translatable to DMD based on EDG-5506’s unique mechanism of action.

45



SOMAscan Comparison of BMD and DMD Fingerprints
Overall, the findings for the Phase 1 clinical trial with EDG-5506 provide compelling evidence for EDG-5506 as a potentially disease modifying treatment for muscular dystrophies. Both in HVs and BMD patients, EDG-5506 was well tolerated and achieved muscle concentrations well above those predicted to demonstrate efficacy based on preclinical disease models. Moreover, EDG-5506 led to a robust, significant reduction in key biomarkers of muscle damage, driving CK, TNNI2, myoglobin and AST to either normal or near normal levels observed in healthy volunteers after only two weeks of dosing. 
Planned Future Clinical Trials
Following successful completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial in HVs and BMD patients, a summary of the on-going and planned clinical studies with EDG-5506 in 2022 is provided in the table below.

46



Summary Table of Upcoming Clinical Trials
Open Label Study in BMD Patients (ARCH Study)
We are currently enrolling the ARCH study, which is an open-label, single-center study that will assess the safety and PK of EDG-5506 over one year in adults with BMD. This study will also investigate the effect of EDG-5506 on biomarkers of muscle fiber damage. We are enrolling participants diagnosed with BMD, who completed the Phase 1b trial, as well as participants who are treatment naïve to EDG-5506. A 10 mg dose will be administered once-daily at night prior to bedtime. We anticipate interim data in the first half of 2022.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial in BMD
The Phase 2 clinical trial in BMD is projected to commence in the first half of 2022 and will assess safety, PK, functional measures and upper leg fat fraction over one year as measured by MRI in BMD adults and adolescents. Assessments in the Phase 2 clinical trial will include muscle performance measures, such as a modified-NSAA (NSAD) and timed function tests, in addition to serum biomarkers of myofiber degeneration (e.g., CK, troponins, myoglobin). 
Natural History Study and Exercise Challenge Study
In 2022, we expect to commence both an observational natural history study, being conducted in collaboration with the GRASP-LGMD Consortium, and a Phase 2 Exercise Challenge Study, to investigate the effect of EDG-5506 on muscle injury biomarkers following exercise in individuals with LGMD2I, BMD or McArdle disease at a single site in Denmark. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial in DMD
We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric DMD patients in the second half of 2022. 

47



Rationale for Studying Adult Becker Muscular Dystrophy Patients
The typical BMD disease course is associated with progressive limb weakness resulting in severe disability and loss of ambulation as well as increased risk of early mortality from cardiac failure. No therapies have been approved for the treatment of BMD.
In 2016, a comprehensive, longitudinal one-year academic study was published of 69 BMD patients aged between six and 69 years. Patients were classified accordingly: deletions ending on exon 45 (del 45-x; n=28), deletions ending on exon 51 (del x-51; n=10), isolated exon 48 deletions (del 48; n=10) and other mutations (n=21). 90% of the del 48 and del x-51 had a mild or asymptomatic BMD disease course as is well known regarding the del x-51 genotype. Interestingly, the del 45-x patients presented with a more pronounced and severe BMD course with significant lower limb weakness measurable with the NSAA over a 12-month period, with the majority losing ambulation at some point in their lifetime.
Patient and Caregiver Engagement Strategy
The muscular dystrophy patient community is highly knowledgeable and active, having been heavily engaged with many of the innovations in the rare disease regulatory and drug development landscape and with strong relationships with KOLs, regulators, the research community and payors. We have and plan to continue to engage comprehensively with patients and physicians to develop positive relationships and transparent communication and become a valued partner in the muscular dystrophy stakeholder community. Through a variety of engagement efforts, we will seek to more fully appreciate the burden of disease from the patient perspective, understand the current standard of care and unmet needs in managing disease, and better learn what is most meaningful to patients. This patient insight will inform our preclinical, clinical development and commercial strategies and we expect it will facilitate more effective execution when recruiting for and conducting trials. We plan to support the key patient advocacy organizations in the United States and the European Union in their research, care, advocacy and educational initiatives to help improve the quality of life of individuals with muscular dystrophy and other diseases. By positioning ourselves as a trusted partner who moves with thoughtful urgency, we believe we will have a voice with the patients that will continue to serve us as we develop EDG-5506 and other programs for neuromuscular and other diseases.
Evolution of Newborn Screening for Muscular Dystrophy
There is typically is a diagnostic delay between when muscular dystrophy symptoms are first noticed by parents and brought to the attention of their primary care physicians, and when a genetic diagnosis is made. Unless there is a known family history, muscular dystrophy has not widely been screened for in infancy.
To fill this gap, a newborn screening initiative was put into place led by muscular dystrophy patient advocacy organizations and community leaders in the mid 2000’s with the goal of identifying and providing care for every child born with muscular dystrophy and achieving Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) status. A critical step in this effort was developing a scalable and cost-effective algorithm for accurately detecting muscular dystrophy that could be implemented at a national level. An Ohio NBS pilot from 2007 to 2011 developed a two-tiered process using CK measured from dried blood spot (DBS) and establishing a threshold level at which a second CK from venous blood was necessary to determine who should have genetic testing. Currently, a newborn screening pilot program in New York State is testing this and other aspects of a comprehensive newborn screening program at a large scale. A Steering Committee is compiling other evidence necessary to support a nomination package to the Advisory Committee for Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) to add muscular dystrophy to the RUSP.
Once the requirements are met and accepted at a national level, implementation then takes place at the state level. State based universal NBS would allow more infants with muscular dystrophy to be identified earlier in life, giving them a greater chance of receiving benefit from optimal care and disease modifying treatments before symptoms manifest and functional milestones are lost.

48



Progress in NBS for muscular dystrophy and future implementation at a national level through inclusion of muscular dystrophy on the RUSP will allow potentially disease modifying therapies, such as EDG-5506, to be initiated early on allowing the possibility to completely alter the devastating natural history of the disease.
Additional Indications
LGMD
LGMD is a general term for muscular dystrophies that are not X-linked and are non-congenital. They are a group of disorders of skeletal muscles that results in progressive limb, shoulder, and hip girdle weakness and wasting, significantly impairing daily function with resultant disability. Collectively, they are the fourth most common genetic cause of muscle weakness. The approximate global prevalence of LGMD as a group is estimated to be from 0.56 to 5.75 per 100,000. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Onset may occur in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later. LGMD leads to a variable shortened lifespan; however, problems can arise in individuals who have problems in heart muscles and the respiratory system.
LGMD is caused by mutations of genes that result in abnormalities in dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, the sarcomere, glycosylation of dystroglycan, vesicle and molecular trafficking, signal transduction pathways, and nuclear functions. There are at least 30 different subtypes of LGMD. The inheritance pattern of LGMD varies and different genetic defects may result in the same clinical symptoms in different patients. Several rare forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (LGMD type 1). Most forms of LGMD are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (LGMD type 2). LGMD type 1 follows a slower and more variable disease course whereas LGMD type 2 tends to have an earlier onset and progresses more quickly.
Like DMD and BMD, most LGMD mutations destabilize the dystrophin/dystroglycan complex, resulting in muscle breakdown with normal muscle contraction and elevated serum CK levels. Treatment of LGMD is exclusively symptomatic involving physical therapy, surgery, and care of the lungs and heart. There are no disease modifying therapies approved to halt disease progression. Because EDG-5506 stabilizes muscle independently from the functional integrity of the dystrophin complex, we anticipate that our approach could also improve muscle health in LGMD patients.
McArdle Disease
McArdle disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV), is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM). It is an ultra-rare disease, and the exact prevalence is not known, but is estimated to be one in 100,000-140,000 patients. It is a pure myopathy characterized by high serum CK activity, exercise intolerance, the second wind phenomenon, acute crises of early fatigue, and contractures, sometimes (50% of cases) with rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, triggered by static muscle contractions or vigorous exercise.
The diagnosis of McArdle’s disease is based on biological findings that reveal a lack of elevation of blood lactate levels during the forearm ischemic exercise test, excess of glycogen, and deficit of myophosphorylase in muscle biopsy or white blood cells. There is currently no specific treatment for McArdle’s disease. Treatment is mostly symptomatic as well as avoiding the performance of intense physical exercise. Healthy lifestyle interventions, such as following a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, are the most effective means of preventing and managing exercise intolerance in McArdle’s disease and require a proactive attitude of clinicians, exercise professionals, patients and caregivers.
In light of the lack of approved therapies and the negative impact of excessive muscle contractures on the pathophysiology of McArdle’s disease, we plan to explore the potential role of EDG-5506 in preserving muscle integrity and function.

Our Research Programs
Our muscle screening platforms have identified small molecule modulators of muscle function with alternative targets and mechanisms beyond those described for EDG-5506. We intend to take maximal advantage of these additional programs to expand our research and development pipeline into therapeutic areas of considerable unmet need.

EDG-002: Novel Molecules for Inherited HCM and Other Devastating Cardiac Disorders
Overview
Our EDG-002 program represents a unique series of novel-mechanism cardiac modulators. This series of compounds exhibit a distinct cardiac desensitizing profile with some overlapping characteristics to cardiac myosin inhibitors such as BMS/Myokardia’s mavacamten and Cytokinetics’ CK-274. However, this series of compounds also offer important mechanistic and phenotypic differences to both BMS/Myokardia’s and Cytokinetics’ molecules, which we believe have the potential to yield improved target product profiles for the treatment of HCM and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Disease Background and Current Treatment Limitations
HCM is the most common form of genetic heart disease, affecting one in 500 individuals and is caused by abnormal proteins in the heart, including cardiac myosin, that lead to excessive cardiac contraction. Estimates suggest there are as many as 630,000 people in the United States suffering from different forms of HCM. Over time, the disruptions in cardiac muscle contraction leads to cardiac stress and thickening of the inner chambers of the heart which become stiffer and less able to pump blood. HCM patients encounter increased risk of heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest.
There are currently no approved therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of HCM. Patients are typically treated with drugs that are indicated for broader cardiovascular disorders and do not address the underlying cause of the disease. As the disease progresses, patients have limited treatment options, such as surgical or other invasive interventions and heart transplant. More recently, the cardiac myosin inhibitor mavacamten has demonstrated significant benefit in obstructive HCM with reductions in cardiac and patient symptoms. However, despite mavacamten’s efficacy, there are still limitations of this approach including a narrow therapeutic index, long terminal half-life (seven to nine days) and limited ability to rescue excessive pharmacology if it develops.
Our Approach
Our EDG-002 program has identified compounds that directly inhibit the cardiac sarcomere but via an alternative mechanism, independent of myosin. In an initial set of studies that we conducted, a tool compound from the EDG-002 program, EDG-6036, was compared to Compound A, a clinical-stage type I myosin inhibitor (synthesized in-house in accordance with its published structure) in head-to-head experiments.
First, myosin inhibitory activity was explored by measuring the actin-activated ATPase of purified cardiac S1 myosin motor sub-fragment. Compound A, inhibited cardiac S1 ATPase in a concentration-dependent manner while EDG-6036 was inactive in this preparation (A). In contrast, both compounds were potent inhibitors of force development in intact slow skeletal muscle fibers, which share many protein components with cardiac muscle (B and C).

50



EDG-6036 targets cardiac contractility through an entirely novel MOA from myosin inhibitors
In subsequent experiments, we observed that oral administration of EDG-6036 led to a reduction in cardiac ejection fraction in healthy rats (A) with a similar exposure relationship to Compound A (B). However, due to PK and mechanistic differences between these compounds (beyond oral availability), the observed dose/exposure relationship is considerably broader for EDG-6036 compared to Compound A (C), allowing for better dose titration.
EDG-6036 decreased cardiac contractility in healthy rats
Cardiac myosin inhibition with either mavacamten or CK274 represents a primary block of muscle contraction that can be difficult to override in situations of excessive pharmacology. Since our EDG-002 series of compounds work through desensitization of cardiac muscle, we sought to understand how these molecules might lead to an improved pharmacological rescue of cardiac inhibition using the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol (ISO). Equivalent 

51



inhibitory doses of Compound A (2 mg/kg) and EDG-6036 (10 mg/kg) were given to healthy rats via oral gavage and then rescue of inhibition was attempted with intravenous infusion of ISO. We observed that rescue of ejection fraction was only partial for Compound A (A) but complete for EDG-6036 (B), highlighting the mechanistic differences between these two approaches.
In vivo cardiac inhibition with EDG-6036 can be reversed
We used an in vitro reconstituted cell system to measure compound efficacy in a model of HCM carrying a common myosin mutation (MYH7 R403Q). Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC), derived from a HCM patient were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, seeded into a hydrogel and reconstituted into a contractile myofiber. Muscle contraction was then quantified in the presence of increasing amounts of compound and compared to iPSC-derived myofibers where the R403Q mutation had been corrected by CRISPR. As expected, MYH7 R403Q myofibers exhibited increased contractile behavior compared to corrected myofibers and both Compound A (A) and EDG-6036 (B) demonstrated potent inhibition of hyper-contraction in these patient-derived cells.
EDG-6036 decreased contraction in reconstituted human myofibers with a HCM mutation
Our cardiac inhibitors have demonstrated activity in models of HCM. In these models, our lead candidate to date, EDG-6036, showed equivalent inhibition of ejection fraction but improved effects on relaxation and rescue of excessive pharmacology relative to Compound A. We believe the results from these preliminary preclinical studies support the potential of (i) our EDG-002 program to yield a lead molecule that could become a new therapeutic standard for 

52



treatment of HCM and (ii) our proprietary drug discovery platform to identify novel and compelling molecules across a variety of muscle tissues and organs implicated in disease.
Next steps
We are aiming to build a rare cardiac disease franchise by initially focusing on the development of a therapeutic for patients with HCM. We are also characterizing a second therapeutic candidate coming out of our EDG-002 program specifically targeted at patients with HFpEF.
Manufacturing
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our CDMOs are obligated to produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We have engaged CDMOs to manufacture EDG-5506 for preclinical and clinical use. All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. Our chemistry is a convergent synthesis of under five steps, appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We obtain our supplies from these CDMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have a long-term supply arrangement in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval.
Sales and Marketing
If any of our product candidates are approved, we currently intend to market and commercialize them in the United States and select international markets, either alone or in collaboration with others.
Competition
Currently, approximately 70% of patients with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. EMFLAZA (deflazacort) is an FDA-approved corticosteroid marketed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and prednisone is also FDA-approved and is marketed by multiple companies. In addition, there are four FDA-approved exon skipping drugs: EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen), AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) and VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen), which are naked PMOs approved for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to Exon 51, Exon 45 and Exon 53 skipping, respectively, and are marketed by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., and VILTEPSO (vitolarsen), a naked PMO approved for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to Exon 53 skipping, which is marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. Companies focused on developing treatments for DMD that target dystrophin mechanisms include Sarepta Therapeutics with SRP-5051, a peptide-linked PMO currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients amenable to Exon 51 skipping, PTC Therapeutics with ataluren, a small molecule targeting nonsense mutations in a Phase 3 clinical trial, Avidity Biosciences, Inc., which is in preclinical development with an antibody oligonucleotide conjugate that targets dystrophin production and Dyne Therapeutics which is also in preclinical development with its proprietary antigen-binding oligonucleotide linker technology that targets dystrophin production. In addition, several companies are in clinical trials to develop gene therapies to treat DMD, including Genethon Company (GNT-0004), Pfizer Inc. (PF-06939926), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRP-9001 and Galgt2 gene therapy program), and Solid Biosciences Inc. (SGT-001). Gene editing treatments that are in preclinical development are also being pursued by Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics. We are also aware of several companies targeting non-dystrophin mechanisms for the treatment of DMD. Moreover, Epirium Bio is developing a synthetic compound that targets cellular energetics and muscle regeneration as a potential therapeutic for BMD and Italfarmaco is also evaluating the use of Givinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, in BMD patients.

Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and drug candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
​
We currently, and expect that we will continue to, own or in-license patents and patent applications related to our key drug candidates. We own patents and patent applications that cover compositions of matter, methods of treating diseasessuch as DMD, BMD, LGMD and muscle spasticity disorders and combination therapies. As of January 21, 2022, we own a patent portfolio consisting of 10 patent families and in-license one patent family from OSIF. We own 2 issued U.S. patents, 4 pending U.S. patent applications, 5 pending PCT applications, and 41 pending foreign applications filed in 15 different countrites and regions including Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Hong Kong. We own one issued U.S. patent that covers compositions of matter of EDG-5506 and methods of treatment using EDG-5506 that is expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term extensions. For our drug candidates, we generally pursue multilayered patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacture. We also intend to pursue patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may be useful in selecting a patient population for use of our drug candidates.We intend to strengthen the patent protection of our drug candidates and technologies through additional patent application filings.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. Additionally, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time a drug is under regulatory review while a patent that covers the drug is in force. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, if available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require 

54



our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

2020 Exclusive License Agreement with The Ohio State Innovation Foundation
We have exclusively licensed intellectual property from The Ohio State Innovation Foundation (OSIF) in a license agreement effective November 20, 2020. We entered into the agreement with OSIF for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products covered by the OSIF licensed intellectual property for the treatment, prevention or palliation of muscular dystrophies and disorders. The product candidates under development by the Company are not based on the intellectual property licensed from OSIF. The patent applications licensed from OSIF may, in the future, provide additional patent coverage for certain aspects of the Company’s product candidates currently under development, depending on the eventual scope of any OSIF patents if and when issued, which scope and likelihood of issuance are uncertain.
Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make payments to OSIF aggregating up to $1.3 million per product covered by the OSIF licensed patent rights upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately $2.3 million per product covered by the OSIF licensed patent rights upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also obligated to pay low single-digit royalties to OSIF based on net sales by us and our affiliates and sublicensees of each product covered by the OSIF licensed patent rights. In addition, in the event we sublicense the OSIF licensed patent rights, we are obligated to pay OSIF a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensing. To date, we have paid OSIF $235,000 in connection with the license agreement.
Our royalty obligations with respect to each product covered by OSIF licensed patent rights in a country extend until the last-to-expire patent claim licensed from OSIF covering the product in the country. The latest possible expiration of patents licensed under the agreement is 2039 in all applicable countries, in the absence of any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use a certain level of effort to develop and commercialize at least one product covered by the OSIF licensed patents or derived from the material provided by OSIF and to achieve certain milestones within set times, subject to certain extensions.
OSIF has the right to terminate the license agreement for our uncured material breach of the license agreement, including if we fail to achieve specified development, regulatory approval and sales milestones within specified timeframes, or for certain events related to our bankruptcy. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time.

Government Regulations
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, nonclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data must be generated, which demonstrate the drug’s quality, safety, and efficacy. Such data must then be organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, the approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) ethics committee, either centralized or with respect to each clinical site, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our royalty obligations of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

56



Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which may review data and endpoints at designated check points, make recommendations and/or halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical trial results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to HVs, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.

57



The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 clinical trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if any all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval of a product candidate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the trial, and any disruption of the trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a list of all subjects affected by the COVID-19-pandemic related study disruption by unique subject identifier and by investigational site and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the trial. In 2020 and 2021, FDA published a number of industry guidance documents, including updates to previous guidance, related to Good Manufacturing Practices, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
NDA Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are 

58



submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. It could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may offer accelerated approval with postmarketing confirmatory trial requirements or approvals subject to other postmarketing requirements, including among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government 

59



requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast-track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a fast-track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast-track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast-track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation (ODD), to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when 

60



there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds on post-approval or Phase IV clinical studies, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

61




● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an 

62



existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States and provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, false claims, transparency, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy, data protection, and security laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales, and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; state and local laws which require the tracking of gifts and other remuneration and any transfer of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
These laws and regulations are subject to change, which can increase the resources needed for compliance and delay drug approval or commercialization. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. Actual or alleged violation of any such laws or regulations may lead to investigations and other claims and proceedings by regulatory authorities and in certain cases, private actors, and violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific details, information on cost-

effectiveness, and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and related services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; it required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; it implemented a new methodology under which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; it expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; it created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and it established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.
The ACA continues to significantly impact the United States’ pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, a process that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was 

64



repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, or healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, to review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and to reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, in 2020, HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturersponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements, and manufacturer price reporting under Medicare Part B. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against HHS challenging various aspects of the rules. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases and allowing Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain covered drug products. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products.
It is possible that additional governmental action may be taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference to pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to develop or sell any product candidates outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time 

65



may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, regulatory approval for our products, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union (EU) Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: The National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. The Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive entered into application on January 31, 2022, is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SOPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years, subject to certain extension. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval. However, SPCs are not the only EU mechanism offering protection for a drug product beyond the patent expiry date. For example, under the EU exclusivity regime, an innovator company can qualify for eight years of data exclusivity, two years of market exclusivity during which generic companies can prepare and apply for marketing approval but cannot market their generic products, and an additional one year of market exclusivity for a new indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies.
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
