Item 1. Business
General
Deckers Outdoor Corporation was incorporated in 1975 under the laws of the State of California and, in 1993, reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, Koolaburra, Hoka, Teva and Sanuk. We believe that our products are distinctive and appeal broadly to women, men and children. We sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to our consumers both domestically and internationally through our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business, which is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. All of our products are currently manufactured by independent manufacturers, primarily in Asia. 
Recent Developments
Restructuring Plan. In February 2016, we announced the implementation of a multi-year restructuring plan which is designed to realign our brands, optimize our retail store fleet, and consolidate our management and operations. As part of this restructuring plan, we realigned our brands across two groups: Fashion Lifestyle and Performance Lifestyle. The Fashion Lifestyle group includes the UGG and Koolaburra brands. The Performance Lifestyle group includes the Teva, Sanuk and Hoka brands. In general, the intent of the restructuring plan is to streamline brand operations, reduce overhead costs, create operating efficiencies and improve collaboration. 
In connection with our restructuring plan, we have closed 32 retail stores as of March 31, 2018, including five stores in fiscal year 2016 and 20 in fiscal year 2017, and consolidated our brand operations and corporate headquarters. We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $55,324 through March 31, 2018, with $1,667, $28,984, and $22,824 of restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and $1,849 in cost of sales during fiscal year 2016 in the consolidated financial statements. We currently do not anticipate incurring material restructuring charges in future periods, though optimization of our owned retail stores remains a focus.
We anticipate closing stores or converting stores to partner retail stores in our wholesale channel, as we continue our strategy of retail store and fleet optimization. We continue to drive and are evolving our retail store and fleet optimization strategies in line with our long-term objectives, and we are targeting a global retail store count of approximately 125 owned stores. While we are seeing initial signs of improvement, our decision to open or close store locations will be evaluated based on the operating results of each store and our retail store and fleet optimization strategies, which may ultimately impact our global retail store count. 
As a result of the implementation of our restructuring plan, we expect to realize an annualized gross SG&A expense savings in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) totaling approximately $85,000 by March 31, 2020. The SG&A expense savings are expected to be primarily derived from reductions in operating costs related to the termination of retail store leases and the conversion of certain of our foreign owned retail stores to partner retail stores, as well as a reduction in overhead costs, including payroll and related benefits, depreciation and amortization, and rent and occupancy costs, among others. As of March 31, 2018, we realized approximately $54,000 of annualized 
3

SG&A expense savings out of the anticipated $85,000 of savings from our restructuring plan. We expect to realize approximately $31,000 of additional annualized SG&A expense savings from our restructuring plan. The additional annualized SG&A expense savings are expected to be primarily derived from further reductions in retail store-related costs, including those listed above. However, both the amount and timing of the actual savings we may achieve as a result of our restructuring plan are uncertain and are based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the timing of lease terminations and store closures, the actual costs associated with closing or converting stores, and the actual and estimated results of operations of each store.
Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Note 2, "Restructuring," of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our restructuring efforts and the impact on our results of operations and reportable operating segments.
Operating Profit Improvement Plan. In addition to the approximate $85,000 of gross annualized SG&A expense savings expected from the implementation of our restructuring plan, as discussed above, we also expect that our other transformation initiatives, announced in February 2017, will result in approximately $65,000 of additional annualized cost of sales improvements and SG&A expense savings, for a total anticipated annual gross cost savings of approximately $150,000. Cost of sales improvements are expected to result from reducing product development cycle times, optimizing material yields, consolidating our factory base, and continuing to move product manufacturing outside of China. Further SG&A expense savings are expected to result from lower corporate infrastructure costs, process improvement efficiencies, and reduced unallocated indirect spend. We have achieved approximately 90% of the expected cost of sales improvements as of March 31, 2018. The remaining additional annualized costs of sales and SG&A expense savings are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
We expect that the approximate $150,000 of annual gross cost savings will result in approximately $100,000 of net annualized operating profit improvement (after reinvestment in marketing and other growth driving initiatives) by the end of fiscal year 2020. However, both the amount and timing of the actual operating profit improvements we may achieve as a result of these transformation initiatives are uncertain and are based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and success of certain production and inventory control improvements, the costs associated with improving and transitioning manufacturing operations, and the net impact of certain costs savings initiatives on our operating profit. 
Products and Brands
We currently market our products primarily under five propriety brands, composed of our three primary brands and our other brands. Collectively, our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, outdoor, and running markets.
UGG. The UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in our industry which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, apparel and accessories with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that attracts women, men and children. We intend to continue diversifying the UGG brand by driving more year-round product sales, including spring and summer footwear, men's products, apparel, home goods and accessories. The UGG brand is sold both domestically and internationally in key markets including the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Germany, China, Japan, and Canada, among others. 
Teva. Teva is a modern active lifestyle brand, born from the outdoors and rooted in adventure. As the originator of the sport sandal, the Teva brand's product line now includes sandals, shoes, and boots. 
During calendar year 2017, we began to leverage elements, including particular styles, of the Ahnu brand under the Teva brand. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018, operations for the Ahnu brand were discontinued and certain remaining styles are sold under the Teva brand. 
Sanuk. Sanuk is a global lifestyle footwear brand rooted in Southern California surf culture. The brand has a history of product innovation and comfort with a full range of footwear.
Other Brands. Other brands consist of: Hoka, a line of premium, running footwear and apparel that offers maximal cushioning with minimal weight and is designed for runners of all capacities, and Koolaburra, a line of fashion casual footwear using sheepskin and other plush materials.

Sales and Distribution
US Distribution. In our wholesale channel, we distribute our products in the US through sales representatives, who are organized by account type or geographically and by brand. In addition to our wholesale channel, we also sell products directly to consumers through our DTC business. 
Currently, our sales force is generally separated by brand, as each brand generally has certain specialty consumers. However, there is some overlap between the sales teams and customers, and we have aligned our brands' sales forces to position them for the future of the brands. 
We distribute products sold in the US through our distribution centers in Camarillo and Moreno Valley, California, as well as through a third-party logistics provider (3PL) in Pennsylvania. Our distribution centers feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers. 
While we continue to operate our distribution center in Camarillo, we are currently working to move all of our Camarillo distribution operations to our Moreno Valley location by the end of calendar year 2019. In June 2017, we exercised our option to expand and extend the lease of our warehouse and distribution center located in Moreno Valley, California through June 2028. Refer to Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies," of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure and discussion.
International Distribution. Internationally, in our wholesale channel, we distribute our products through independent distributors and wholly-owned subsidiaries in many regions and countries, including Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Canada, among others. We also sell products internationally, particularly in China, through partner retail stores, which are branded stores that are wholly-owned and operated by third parties. When a partner retail store is opened or a company-owned retail store is converted into a partner retail store, the related sales are recorded in our UGG or Sanuk brands wholesale reportable operating segment. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through our DTC business. For our wholesale and DTC businesses, we distribute our products through a number of distribution centers managed by 3PLs in certain international locations. 
UGG Wholesale. We sell the UGG brand primarily through domestic higher-end department stores such as Nordstrom, Dillard's, and Macy's, as well as lifestyle retailers such as Journeys, and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve and change to reflect changing consumer preferences, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution approach and segmentation.
Teva Wholesale. We sell our Teva brand footwear primarily through specialty outdoor, sporting goods, and department stores, including retailers such as REI, Famous Footwear, DSW, and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. 
Sanuk Wholesale. We sell our Sanuk brand footwear primarily through domestic independent action sports and outdoor specialty footwear retailers and larger national retail chains, including Journeys, Dillard's, DSW, REI, and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. 
Other Brands Wholesale. Our other brands are sold primarily through domestic specialty running and department stores, outdoor and independent specialty retailers, and through online retailers. Key accounts of the Hoka brand include Running Warehouse, Road Runner Sports, Running Specialty Group, REI, and Zappos.com. Key accounts of the Koolaburra brand include Kohl's and Rack Room Shoes.
 Direct-to-Consumer. Our DTC business is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. As a result of our evolving Omni-Channel strategy, we believe that our retail stores and websites are largely intertwined and interdependent. We believe that many consumers interact with both our brick and mortar stores and our websites before making purchasing decisions. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online, and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store. Some examples that demonstrate the extent to which the sales channels are combined and help improve our inventory productivity include the following:

• | “UGG Rewards”: We have implemented a consumer loyalty program under which points and awards are earned across the DTC business.

• | “Infinite UGG”: We provide online shopping access inside retail stores for all SKUs available on our E-Commerce websites.


• | "Ship from Store": Inventory that is available in our stores, but is out of stock online can be shipped from our stores. Future advancements in this capability will use algorithms to select the optimal fulfillment source.


• | "UGG Closet": A limited E-Commerce outlet channel which we have offered since December 2016. The online portal functions similarly to an outlet store in that it provides a way to closeout inventory directly to consumers.


• | “Buy Online / Return in-Store”: Our consumers can buy online and return products to the store.


• | “Click and Collect”: Our consumers can buy online and have products delivered to certain of our retail stores for pick-up.


• | “Retail Inventory Online”: Our consumers can view specific store location inventory online before visiting the store.

Our retail stores enable us to expose consumers to a greater breadth of product, directly impact our consumers' experiences, sell the products at retail prices and generate greater gross margins. Our retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept and UGG brand outlet stores. Through our outlet stores, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, as well as products made specifically for the outlet stores. At March 31, 2018, we had a total of 165 retail stores worldwide, which includes 98 concept stores and 67 outlet stores. Included in the total count of retail stores worldwide are concession stores, which are concept stores that are operated by us within a department or other store, which we lease from the store owner by paying a percentage of concession store sales. Partner retail stores are excluded from the total count of worldwide company-owned retail stores. 
Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure and discussion.
Product Design and Development
The design and development functions for all of our brands are performed by a combination of internal design and development staff and outside freelance designers. Refer to Note 1, "General," of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the research and development costs we have incurred for the last three fiscal years.
To ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in our product design and development process, we continually evaluate the availability and cost of raw materials, the capabilities and capacity of our independent manufacturers and the target retail price of new products. The design and development staff works closely with brand management to develop new styles for our product lines. Throughout the development process, we have multiple design and development reviews, which we then coordinate with our independent manufacturers. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We do not manufacture our products. We outsource production to independent manufacturers, primarily in Asia. We require our independent manufacturers and designated suppliers to adopt our Supplier Code of Conduct, which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, and environmental compliance before we are willing to conduct business with them. We also require our manufacturing partners and licensees to comply with our Restricted Substances Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, and other compliance policies and procedures as a condition of doing business with us.
Production by our independent manufacturers is performed in accordance with our detailed specifications and is subject to our quality control standards. We maintain a buying office in Hong Kong and on-site supervisory offices in Pan Yu City, China and Hai Phong City, Vietnam, which together serve as a link to our independent manufacturers. We believe this regional presence provides predictability of material availability, product flow and adherence to final design specifications. The majority of the materials and components used in the production of our products by these independent manufacturers are purchased from independent suppliers that we designate.

At our direction, our manufacturers currently purchase the majority of the sheepskin used in our products from two tanneries in China, which source their sheepskin for our products primarily from Australia and the UK. We maintain communication with the tanneries to monitor the available supply of sufficient high-quality sheepskin for our projected UGG brand production. To ensure adequate supplies for our manufacturers, we forecast our usage of sheepskin in advance at a forward price. We have also entered into purchase commitments with certain sheepskin suppliers. We believe current supplies are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated demand, but we continue to investigate our options to accommodate our expected growth or unexpected supply chain issues. Refer to Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies," of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our minimum purchase commitments.
Beginning in 2013, in an effort to partially reduce our dependency on sheepskin, we began using a proprietary new raw material, UGGpure, which is a wool woven into a durable backing, in some of our UGG brand products. Excluding sheepskin and UGGpure, we believe that substantially all raw materials and components used to manufacture our footwear, apparel and accessories, including wool, rubber, leather, and nylon webbing, are generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. We generally outsource our manufacturing requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders or short-term purchase commitments rather than maintaining long-term purchase commitments with our independent manufacturers.
We have instituted pre-production, in-line, and post-production inspections to meet or exceed the high quality demanded by us and consumers of our products. Our quality assurance program includes our own employee on-site inspectors at our independent manufacturers, who oversee the production process and perform quality assurance inspections. We also routinely inspect our products upon arrival at our distribution centers.
Corporate Responsibility
Community Outreach. During fiscal year 2018, we donated approximately $1,123 to 176 nonprofit organizations. The end of calendar year 2018 was a particularly difficult time for California. Faced with various natural disasters from fires to mudslides, we focused much of our efforts on serving our local Santa Barbara, California community. During fiscal year 2018, 8% of our charitable contributions were dedicated to environmental impact mitigation efforts because we understand the importance of protecting our planet. We encourage employees to volunteer by compensating them for up to 24 hours of volunteer time each fiscal year. 
Sustainability. As a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, our global scale is significant. Equally significant is the responsibility we have to set an example in our industry by advancing sustainable business, and we believe in developing quality products while striving for minimal environmental impact. In October 2016, we announced our official participation in the United Nations Global Compact, the world's largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative. As part of this initiative, we adopted Sustainable Development Goals in the following areas:

• | material sourcing;


• | waste and chemical management;


• | water quality impact;


• | human rights;


• | energy usage by us and our manufacturing partners; and


• | gender equality and quality education.

The main focus of our sustainability efforts is on our product materials and supply chain. During fiscal year 2018, we sourced 99.2% of our leather supplies from Leather Working Group certified tanneries, which maintain protocols that promote sustainable and appropriate environmental business practices within the leather industry. We are also taking a closer look into all of our materials, from packaging to product, so that we can set further sustainability targets in fiscal year 2019. We also have an Animal Welfare Policy which sets forth strict guidelines for the purchase of materials used in our products. 
We are committed to measurable sustainability action in our corporate locations, retail store spaces, and distribution center operations. Our corporate headquarters is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (commonly referred to as LEED) certified and, during fiscal year 2018, we installed solar panels to help offset approximately 40% of our electrical energy usage. We also continually measure electricity usage at our distribution center locations and retail store operations and strive to reduce our environmental footprint whenever possible. We 
7

have implemented waste diversion efforts at our corporate locations and have adopted a Paper and Forest Procurement Policy, which sets forth our commitment to purchasing paper products with a minimum of 30% post-consumer recycled content. 
We are equally dedicated to sustainability actions within our brands' sectors. Below are some of the ways our brands are working to make a difference:

• | On behalf of the UGG brand, we contribute to the HERproject, a collaborative initiative managed by Business for Social Responsibility (commonly referred to as BSR) that strives to empower low-income women working in global supply chains. We also involve the UGG brand in the Textile Exchange’s Kickstart Program, which accelerates the availability of Responsible Wool Standards (commonly referred to as RWS) certified wool into supply chains.


• | On behalf of the Teva brand, we support the Los Padres ForestWatch, as well as Conservation Alliance, whose mission is to partner with organizations to protect wild places for their habitat and recreation values.


• | On behalf of the Sanuk brand, we have teamed up with the Surfrider Foundation, a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our oceans, waves and beaches.


• | We support Camber Outdoors, the only national organization dedicated to achieving women’s equality in the active-outdoor industries, on behalf of the Hoka, Sanuk and Teva brands.

The work that we have done to date has allowed us to make great strides in promoting responsible stewardship and our Sustainable Development Goals continue to serve as guideposts for our future progress.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of UGG brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st and the highest percentage of Teva and Sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. Due to the size of the UGG brand relative to our other brands, our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st have significantly exceeded net sales in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. For further discussion, including regarding the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The markets that we operate in are highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic and footwear companies, branded apparel companies and retailers with their own private labels. Although the footwear industry is fragmented to a certain degree, many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than us, including athletic shoe companies, several of which compete directly with some of our products. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of E-Commerce has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear, apparel and accessories industry. In particular, and in part due to the popularity of our UGG brand products, we face increasing competition from a significant number of domestic and international competitors selling products designed to compete directly or indirectly with our UGG brand products. We believe that our ability to successfully compete depends on numerous factors, including responding to consumer preferences, producing appealing product, and pricing products competitively, among others. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of how we compete.
Patents and Trademarks
We utilize trademarks for virtually all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products, promoting our brands, and distinguishing our products from the products of others. We currently hold trademark registrations for "UGG," "Teva," "Sanuk," "Hoka One One," "Koolaburra," "Ahnu," "UGGpure," and other marks in the US, and for certain of the marks in many other countries, including Canada, China, the UK, various countries in the European Union, Japan and Korea. As of March 
8

31, 2018, we hold 184 designs and inventions with corresponding design or utility patent registrations, plus 9 designs and inventions which are currently pending registration. These patents expire at various times. We regard our proprietary rights as valuable assets and vigorously protect such rights against infringement by third parties.
Inventory Management
We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. We have put in place systems and processes designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition, we believe that added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our outlet stores and other liquidation channels are key areas of focus that will enhance inventory performance. 
Our practice, and the general practice in the footwear, apparel and accessories industry, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. As it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. This can affect our inventory levels as we build pre-launch quantities. 
Backlog
We encourage our wholesale and distributor customers to place a significant portion of orders as pre-season orders, which are typically placed up to 12 months prior to the anticipated shipment date, as well as in-season fill-in orders that can be shipped immediately. We work with our customers through pre-season programs to enable us to better plan our production schedule, inventory and shipping requirements. 
We have historically defined backlog as unfilled customer orders from our wholesale customers and distributors as of any particular date, which represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date, some of which are subject to cancellation prior to shipment. Effective as of the end of fiscal year 2018, our calculation of backlog also includes bulk orders which generally comprise larger volume orders from significant customer accounts. These types of orders typically have terms that allow customers to vary the location and timing of shipments. 
As of March 31, 2018, our backlog was approximately $855,000. If our backlog as of March 31, 2017 had been calculated in the same manner, on a comparable basis, this represents an approximate 4% year-over-year increase over our backlog as of March 31, 2017. 

We believe backlog is an imprecise indicator of our actual product shipments and future operating results and is not material to an overall understanding of our business, especially given that backlog excludes sales within our DTC reportable operating segment as well as in-season orders. The backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the timing of customer orders, the timing of product shipments, the potential that certain orders may be cancelled, and our manufacturing schedule. As a result, comparisons of backlog from period-to-period are not necessarily indicative of our future operating results. 
Employees
At March 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,500 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia, none of whom were represented by a union. This figure includes approximately 1,700 employees in our retail stores worldwide, which includes part-time and seasonal employees. 
Financial Information about Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
Our five reportable operating segments include the strategic business units responsible for the worldwide operations of our brands' (UGG, Teva, Sanuk and other brands) wholesale divisions, as well as our DTC business. The majority of our sales and long-lived assets are in the US. Within our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, refer to Note 12, "Reportable Operating Segments," for further discussion of our reportable operating segments and to Note 13, "Concentration of Business," for financial information about geographic areas and concentration of related business risks.
