Item 1.
Business. 
 General
 The LGL Group, Inc. (the "Company," "LGL," "we," "us," or "our") is engaged in investment and manufacturing business activities. The Company, through its manufacturing business subsidiaries, is a globally-positioned producer of industrial and commercial products and services. We operate in two identified segments. Our electronic components segment is currently focused on the design and manufacture of highly-engineered, high reliability frequency and spectrum control products. These electronic components and modules ensure reliability and security in both commercial and military aerospace and defense communications, low noise and base accuracy for laboratory instruments, and synchronous data transfers throughout the wireless and Internet infrastructure. Our electronic instruments segment is focused on the design and manufacture of high-performance Frequency and Time reference standards that form the basis for timing and synchronization in various applications including satellite communication, time transfer systems, network synchronization, electricity distribution and metrology. 
 The Company was incorporated in 1928 under the laws of the State of Indiana, and in 2007, the Company was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as The LGL Group, Inc. We maintain our executive offices at 2525 Shader Road, Orlando, Florida 32804. Our telephone number is (407) 298-2000. Our Internet address is www.lglgroup.com. Our common stock and warrants are traded on the NYSE American (“NYSE”) under the symbols "LGL" and “LGL WS”, respectively.
 Manufacturing Businesses and Potential Spin-Off
 We operate our manufacturing businesses through our two principal subsidiaries, M-tron Industries, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "MtronPTI"), which has design and manufacturing facilities in Orlando, Florida; Yankton, South Dakota; and Noida, India, and Precise Time and Frequency, LLC ("PTF"), which has a design and manufacturing facility in Wakefield, Massachusetts. We also have local sales and customer support offices in Hong Kong and Austin, Texas. 
 In late 2021, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved progressing with the Spin-Off (as defined below) of MtronPTI. Completion of the Spin-Off is subject to a number of conditions, including stockholder approval of the transaction. If approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Spin-Off will separate the business activities and investments of the Company and create two separate, publicly-traded companies: (1) the Company, which will continue to own and operate PTF and hold substantially all the Company’s cash and marketable securities, and (2) MtronPTI, which includes the operations of Piezo Technology, Inc. and M-tron Asia, LLC (the “Spin-Off”). 
 1

The Spin-Off, if approved by the Company’s stockholders, is expected to be effected through a pro rata issuance of shares of MtronPTI’s common stock to the Company’s stockholders structured as a tax-free distribution. Stockholders of the Company will receive one share of MtronPTI’s common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock held of record as of the close of business on the record date for the distribution. As a result, the Company’s stockholders as of the record date for the Spin-Off will also become the stockholders of MtronPTI after the Spin-Off. The Company will cease to have any ownership interest in MtronPTI following the Spin-Off, but the Company’s stockholders will, unless they sell their shares, be the stockholders of both the Company and MtronPTI.
Management believes that, if completed, the Spin-Off would enable shareholders to more clearly evaluate the performance and future potential of each entity on a standalone basis, while allowing each entity to pursue its own distinct business strategy and capital allocation policy. There can be no assurance that the Spin-Off will be completed.
 Investment in Sponsor of a SPAC which Completed its 2021 Merger with IRNT
 LGL Systems Acquisition Holding Company, LLC, a partially owned subsidiary of the LGL Group, served as the sponsor (the “Sponsor”) of LGL Systems Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, commonly referred to as a “SPAC” or blank check company, formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination in the aerospace, defense and communications industries (the “SPAC”). The Company invested $6.1 million for its partial ownership in the Sponsor. The SPAC completed a merger with its target company, IronNet Cybersecurity, Inc., on August 26, 2021 and changed its name to IronNet, Inc. (“IronNet” or “IRNT”) (the “IronNet Business Combination”). On September 14, 2021, as a result of its investment in the Sponsor, the Company received 1,572,529 shares of IRNT common stock and 2,065,000 private warrants exchangeable into shares of IRNT common stock. IRNT is a publicly-traded company on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “IRNT.” As of December 31, 2021, the Company sold 1,455,315 shares of its IRNT common stock partially monetizing its $6.1 million Sponsor investment. Proceeds of $18.5 million from the sale of these shares and the closing of certain IRNT-related derivative transactions were received. At December 31, 2021, 1,338,620 shares of IRNT common stock remained in our portfolio. 
Business Strategy
 Our objective is to delivery long-term investment growth to our shareholders maximizing shareholder value. This includes developing businesses and positioning them as independent entities to enhance shareholder value and alignment. 
 Our manufacturing businesses, MtronPTI and PTF, employ a market-based approach of designing and offering new products to our customers through both organic research and development, and through strategic partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions or mergers. We seek to leverage our core strength as an engineering leader to expand client access, add new capabilities and continue to diversify our product offerings. Our focus is on investments that will differentiate us, broaden our portfolio and lead toward higher levels of integration organically and through joint venture, merger and acquisition opportunities. We believe that successful execution of this strategy will lead to a transformation of our product portfolio towards multi-component integrated offerings, longer product life cycles, better margins and improved competitive position. 
 LGL Group continues to strive for profitable growth internally and through acquisition. LGL, on a proforma standalone basis after the Spin-Off, would continue to own and develop its frequency reference and time standard synchronization solutions business through its PTF subsidiary platform, and is expected to retain substantially all the Company’s cash and marketable securities of approximately $46 million at December 31, 2021.
 Business Segments 
 The Company conducts its business through two business segments:  Electronic Components, which includes all products manufactured and sold by MtronPTI, and Electronic Instruments, which includes all products manufactured and sold by PTF.

Spectrum Control seeks to develop higher power handling, higher levels of integration and a range of integrated products within the RF subsystem.
 Electronic Instruments Segment
 Overview of PTF
 PTF designs, manufactures and markets for sale time and frequency products. The industries PTF serves include computer networking, satellite ground stations, electric utilities, broadcasting and telecommunication systems. PTF was originally founded in 2002 and its assets were acquired by LGL in September 2016 through a business acquisition, making us a broader-based supplier of highly engineered products for the generation of time and frequency references for synchronization and control. Since its inception, PTF has developed a comprehensive portfolio of time and frequency instruments complemented by a wide range of ancillary products such as distribution amplifiers and redundancy auto switches.
 PTF Products
 PTF's products range from simple, low-cost time and frequency solutions to premium products designed to deliver maximum performance for the most demanding applications. PTF's products include Frequency and Time Reference 
 3

Standards, RF, digital, and optical time code distribution amplifiers, redundancy auto switches and NTP servers, all of which are used in a broad range of applications worldwide.
 PTF's Frequency and Time Reference Standards include quartz Frequency Standards, GPS/GNS Frequency and Time Standards and rubidium atomic Frequency Standards. The de facto standard for many highly demanding applications, such as satellite communications, is PTF's range of GPS/GNS disciplined quartz frequency and time standards. The MtronPTI high-quality quartz oscillators utilized deliver outstanding phase noise and short-term stability performance for applications where low noise is paramount. This outstanding short-term performance, coupled with the long-term stability and accuracy of the external GNS reference signals, which can be from GPS, Galileo, Glonass or QZSS, provides the user excellent all-around performance that is highly cost-effective.
 When two or more computers are involved, accurate time keeping is a challenge especially when the computers are in different locations. PTF's range of GNS Time and Frequency References and Network Time Servers deliver a high level of performance that allows customers to synchronize to Universal Time Coordinated, in a number of cost- effective forms to meet a multitude of time and frequency reference requirements. Applications range from low phase noise, highly stable and accurate system frequency references for Sat-Com and Digital Broadcasting applications, to computer networks, shipboard time code references and e-commerce time stamping applications. With respect to Universal Coordinated Time (“UTC”), the Company has recently developed long-term time synchronization capability of less than 10 nanoseconds.
 PTF's portfolio of distribution amplifiers covers multiple signal types including RF, digital, time code, configurable and optical. The distribution range is designed to complement the high quality of the frequency and time references and provide the most effective cost/performance solution for the application, including options for full remote monitoring/control (including RF analog signal monitoring) and optional level control.
 The distribution product range includes standard fixed configuration units with either 12 or 16 channels together with more flexible units that allow the user to define specific configurations including different types of input/output signals combined into a convenient 1U or 2U package with up to 36 output channels.
 PTF's series of redundancy auto switches range from simple level detection to highly sophisticated sensing capability, extremely fast switching options and full Ethernet connectivity, to provide remote monitoring control, and including integration with SNMP management systems. The most recent model includes multi-channel input capability as well as the ability to switch up to three input types of signals.
 Customers
 We primarily work directly with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to define the right solutions for their unique applications, including the design of custom parts with unique part numbers. Actual sales of production parts may be directly to the OEM or through either its designated contract manufacturers or franchised distributors of our products. As a result, we have highly-skilled sales engineers who work directly with the designers and program managers at their OEMs providing a high-level of engineering support at all points within the process.
 In 2021, our largest customer, a commercial aerospace and defense company, accounted for $7,870,000, or 28.0%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $7,810,000, or 25.1%, of the Company’s total revenues in 2020. The Company’s second largest customer in 2021, a defense contractor, accounted for $3,138,000, or 11.2%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $5,550,000, or 17.8%, of the Company’s total revenues, in 2020. The loss of either of these customers, or a decrease in their demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.
 As of December 31, 2021, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $2,595,000, or 53.2%, of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $2,301,000, or 53.4%, of accounts receivable. The insolvency of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
 Competition
 We design, manufacture and market products for the generation, synchronization and control of time and frequency as well as spectrum control products. There are numerous domestic and international manufacturers who are capable of providing custom-designed products comparable in quality and performance to our products. Our competitive strategy begins with our focus on niche markets where precise specification and reliability are the major

requirements. Competitors in our electronic components segment include, but are not limited to, Vectron International and Microsemi Corporation (both divisions of Microchip Technology Incorporated), K&L Microwave (a division of Dover Corporation) and Rakon Limited. Competitors in our electronic instruments segment include, but are not limited to, Microsemi Corporation, Spectracom Corporation and Brandywine Communications.
 Research and Development
 Utilizing our understanding of market requirements, we employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation when selecting new product development projects. A cross-functional team comprised of engineering, marketing, operations, sales and finance reviews the merits of specific projects seeking to invest in products that will exceed a specific return on investment level and a payback expectation within one to two years. In addition, the team considers the inherent value of intellectual property that each project presents with consideration for technical roadmap objectives.
 Research and development expense was approximately $2,212,000 and $2,142,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and will remain a significant part of the Company's efforts to revitalize our intellectual property position.
 Marketing and Sales
 We have a highly skilled team of sales engineers who work in tandem with a worldwide network of more than 30 independent external manufacturer representatives and franchised electronics distributors to market and sell our products. An important part of the sales process is gaining qualification of specific products from the OEM, confirming suitability for use in a specific system design, which is commonly referred to as a "design-win." Through direct contact with our clients and through our representative network, we are able to understand the needs of the marketplace and then guide our product development process to allocate resources to meeting those requirements.
Domestic Revenues
 Our domestic revenues were $22,096,000 in 2021, or 78.5% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $23,752,000, or 76.2% of total consolidated revenues, in 2020.
 International Revenues
 Our international revenues were $6,044,000 in 2021, or 21.5% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $7,410,000, or 23.8% of total consolidated revenues, in 2020. In each of 2021 and 2020, these revenues were derived mainly from customers in Asia, with significant sales in Malaysia. We avoid significant currency exchange risk by transacting and settling substantially all of our international sales in United States dollars.
Seasonality
 Our business is not seasonal, although shipment schedules may be affected by the production schedules of our customers, or their contract manufacturers based on regional practices or customs.
Order Backlog
 Our order backlog was $29,797,000 and $19,801,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The backlog of unfilled orders includes amounts based on signed contracts as well as agreed letters of intent, which we have determined are firm orders and likely to proceed. Although backlog represents only firm orders that are considered likely to be fulfilled primarily within the 12 months following receipt of the order, cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur.
 Order backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations, deferrals, revised project scope and cost. We expect to fill substantially all of our 2021 order backlog in 2022, but cannot provide assurances as to what portion of the order backlog will be fulfilled in a given year.
 Raw Materials
 Generally, most raw materials used in the production of our products are available in adequate supply from a number of sources and the prices of these raw materials are relatively stable. However, some raw materials, including printed circuit boards, quartz and certain metals including steel, aluminum, silver, gold, tantalum and 
 5

palladium, are subject to greater supply fluctuations and price volatility, as experienced in recent years. In general, we have been able to include some cost increases in our pricing, but in some cases our margins were adversely impacted.
 Changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has caused disrupted supply chains and the ability to obtain components and raw materials around the world for most companies, including us. On occasion, one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable resulting in unanticipated redesign and/or delays in shipments. Continued identification of alternative supply sources or other mitigations are important in minimizing disruption to our supply chain.
 Intellectual Property
 We have no patents, trademarks or licenses that are considered to be significant to our business or operations. Rather, we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering and technical staff in areas of product design and manufacturing processes, including our staff’s ability to customize products to meet difficult specifications, as well as proprietary know-how and information.
Government Regulations
 As a supplier to certain U.S. Government defense contractors, we must comply with significant procurement regulations and other requirements. Maintaining registration under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for all of our related production facilities is also required. One of those production facilities must comply with additional requirements for its production processes and for selected personnel in order to maintain the security of classified information. These requirements, although customary within these markets, increase our performance and compliance costs. 
 We are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency and Defense Contract Management Agency. These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies. Any cost found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. 
 From time to time, we may also be subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our or our customers' operations and products, and are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We or our customers may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, or result in a diminution in revenue from our customers, if we or our customers are found to have violated the law or are indicted or convicted for violations of federal laws related to government security regulations, employment practices or protection of the environment, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law. Such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from serving as a supplier to government contractors for some period of time. Such convictions or actions could have a material adverse effect on us and our operating results. The costs of cooperating or complying with such audits or investigations may also adversely impact our financial results.
 Our manufacturing operations, products, and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and other chemicals. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, both within the United States and internationally, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance that would be associated with such regulations. To date, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company have not been materially affected by compliance with current federal, state, and local laws and regulations (domestic and foreign) relating to the protection of the environment. However, we cannot predict the effect of future laws and regulations.
