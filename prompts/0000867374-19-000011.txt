Item 1: Business
Overview
EFI is a world leader in customer-centric digital printing innovation focusing on the transformation of the printing, packaging, ceramic tile decoration, and textile industries from the use of traditional analog based printing to digital on-demand printing. EFI was incorporated in Delaware in 1988 and commenced operations in 1989. Our initial public offering of common stock was completed in 1992. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol EFII. Our corporate headquarters are located at 6750 Dumbarton Circle, Fremont, California 94555.
We offer a wide-range of products and services for industrial digital printing. Our products and services are grouped in the following categories: Industrial Inkjet, Productivity Software, and Fiery. 
Products and Services

coatings; digital inkjet printer parts; and professional services. Printing surfaces include paper, vinyl, corrugated, textile, glass, plastic, aluminum composite, ceramic tile, wood, and many other flexible and rigid substrates.
Display Graphics. Our display graphics products consist of super-wide format VUTEk printers (including h-series, HS-series and GS/LX-series, ) and roll-to-roll product families (including r-series). Our new VUTEk hybrid LED printer h-series debuted in October 2018 when we launched VUTEk h3 which offers maximum throughput of up to 74 boards per hour. In January 2019, we launched VUTEk h5, our newest higher-speed, premium-quality hybrid flatbed/roll-to-roll super-wide format LED printer, which can run up to 109 boards per hour and offers eight-color and optional four-color printing modes plus white, as well as an up to nine-layer print capability.
Our HS series of high-speed printers are alternatives to analog presses used by high volume graphic producers and are based on pin & cure printing technology. In 2018, we launched the HS125 F4 and HS 100 F4 inkjet presses for “Fast Graphics” out-of-home applications of hybrid flatbed/roll super-wide format products. The two new printers reconfigure the eight ink channels of the VUTEk HS series platform in a CMYK x 2 setup, efficiently addressing the need for cost-effective production on banners, billboards, building wraps and similar applications. 
VUTEk super-wide format roll-to-roll printers include advanced material handling features such as in-line cutting and slitting. In 2018, we launched the VUTEk 3r+ and 5r+ LED roll-to-roll printers, which print at speeds up to 4,896 square feet per hour, with resolutions up to 1,200 dpi, and incorporate 7-picoliter Ultra-Drop technology. 
Our wide format display graphics products consist of roll-to-roll, flatbed, and hybrid product families for the entry-level and mid-range industrial digital inkjet printer market. In 2018, we launched a new 3.2-meter Pro 32r wide format roll-to-roll LED printer providing a more competitive and economical, all-in-one, production-level printer, delivering up to 5,000 square meters per month. In 2017, we launched our wide format Pro 24f flatbed and Pro 16h LED hybrid printers. 
Corrugated Packaging and Display. Our first single pass, ultra-high-speed LED industrial inkjet corrugated packaging press, Nozomi C18000, debuted in 2017. It is a revolutionary cost-effective solution for the corrugated, paper packaging, display printing, and other markets as it produces on-demand and just-in-time customized campaigns with direct to substrate printing as well as proofs on demand. In 2018, we announced new Nozomi print capabilities including a white ink feature and updated corrugated production workflow. With the new white ink feature, packaging converters can create impressive photographic images and vivid colors directly on brown kraft liner board.
Our VUTEk display graphics super-wide and wide format, and Nozomi corrugated packaging and display industrial digital inkjet printers incorporate “cool cure” LED printing technology. LED technology uses less heat than the traditional curing process resulting in increased uptime and greater reliability. 
Textile. Our textile industrial inkjet products consist of the Reggiani and VUTEk FabriVU product families.
Reggiani industrial inkjet textile printers address the full scope of advanced textile printing with versatile printers suitable for dye sublimation, pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, pure disperse dye, and water-based dispersed printing ink. Reggiani is at the forefront of digital printing as an alternative to either analog printing or single color (dyed) garments. Reggiani provides an overall solution for the entire textile printing process from yarn treatment to fabric printing and finishing for a wide variety of substrates and applications (fashion, home textile, sportswear, signage, automotive, and outdoor). 
A significant driver for the adoption of digital textile printing is the growth of “fast fashion,” which is a term used by fashion retailers to express the need for designs to move quickly from the runway to the retailer to capture current fashion trends. The digital textile printing market has also benefited from sports apparel with short run production quantities, closer geographic proximity to end-use markets, and environmental awareness, as digital printing has a significantly lower environmental footprint than analog production, consuming less water, and generating less waste. 
We demonstrated our new Reggiani BOLT textile printer in November 2018. It is an advanced ultra-high-speed digital single-pass printer with the potential to revolutionize the textile printing market, designed to provide users with high uptime and reliability, outstanding performance, superior printing uniformity and accuracy, long print head life and minimal maintenance needs. We anticipate commercially releasing this product in 2019.

In 2018 we launched the COLORS and POWER industrial digital textile inkjet printers. The COLORS printer offers 12 color printing for the most accurate color reproduction in our product line and vivid colors on a variety of textiles. The POWER printer features our recirculating ink system which increases inkjet head life and our ink recovery system that reduces overall ink consumption. 
Our VUTEk FabriVU textile printers are specialty hybrid flatbed/roll-fed printers that produce digitally printed fabrics, soft signage, or deep draw thermoformed and other custom applications. We launched the 3.4M FabriVU 340i in 2018 which features in-line sublimation for direct to textile signage printing in a single step, eliminating the need for running the textile in a heat press after printing. 
Ceramic Tile Decoration. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration inkjet printers are utilized by the ceramic tile and building material manufacturing industries. 
In 2018, we launched Cretaprint C5 and D5 models which feature the new e•D5 print head that optimizes printer performance by assuring better alignment and higher throughput speeds. In 2017, we launched the Cretaprint C4 Twin, featuring a dual print head approach with up to four double print bars and widths up to 0.7 meters. We also launched the Cretaprint P4 in 2017 featuring up to 12 print bars, 1.4 meter print widths, and resolution of 360 dpi. 
Ink. Our ink provides a recurring revenue stream generated from sales to our existing customer base of installed printers.
VUTEk printers primarily use digital UV and LED curable ink, although our solvent ink printers remain in use in the field. We were first to market with digital UV curable ink incorporating “cool cure” LED technology for use in high-end production super-wide, wide format, and corrugated packaging and display digital inkjet printing systems. We sell a variety of third party branded textile ink to users of our textile digital inkjet printers, including dye sublimation, pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, water-based dispersed printing ink, and coatings. We launched our internal formulation of our reactive dye ink in 2016. In 2016, we introduced our soluble salt-based ceramic digital ink formulation. 
Rialco Limited (“Rialco”), which we acquired in 2016, supplies dye powders and color products for the textile, digital print, and other decorating industries. Rialco’s pure disperse dyes are particularly important in the manufacture of high-quality dye sublimation inkjet ink for textile applications, which is a key growth area in the global migration from analog to digital print. Rialco’s technical and commercial capabilities benefit the Industrial Inkjet segment in the sourcing, specification, and purification of high quality dyes and expand our research, development, and innovation base to develop ink for our markets.
Label Printing. We entered into a Support Services and License Agreement (“Agreement”) with Xeikon, N.V. (“Xeikon”), a division of the Flint Group, in November 2017. Pursuant to the Agreement, we provided Xeikon access to the Jetrion customer list, which enabled Xeikon to sell Jetrion printers and re-sell our UV and LED label ink. Xeikon will purchase UV and LED label ink exclusively from us and resell to both our current customer base as well as new Xeikon inkjet customers over the four-year term of the Agreement. We cannot sell Jetrion printers during the four-year term of the Agreement.
Customer Base. Our industry-leading VUTEk display graphics super-wide and wide format UV, LED, and thermoforming industrial inkjet printers and inks are used by commercial photo labs, large sign shops, graphic screen printers, specialty commercial printers, and digital and billboard graphics providers serving the out-of-home advertising and industrial specialty print segments by printing banners, signage, building wraps, flags, point of purchase and exhibition signage, backlit displays, fleet graphics, photo-quality graphics, art exhibits, customized architectural elements, billboards, thermoplastic decoration, and other large graphic displays.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
We have assembled, internally and through acquisitions, an experienced team of technical support, sales, and marketing personnel with backgrounds in color reproduction, digital pre-press, image processing, business process automation systems, networking, and software and hardware engineering, as well as market knowledge of the sectors we serve. We expect to continue to expand the scope and sophistication of our products and gain access to new markets and channels of distribution by applying our expertise in these areas.
Industrial Inkjet
Our Industrial Inkjet products are sold primarily through our direct sales force, augmented by some select distributors. We entered the corrugated inkjet printer market with the introduction of our Nozomi digital inkjet corrugated printer in 2017. We are leveraging our existing display graphics sales team together with dedicated packaging specialists and participation in corrugated packaging trade shows in most major markets around the globe. The market for corrugated digital printers is new and our team will also be building market demand for this approach as well as selling our printers. 
Textile digital printing is an alternative to either analog printing or dyed garments. Widespread adoption of digital textile printing depends on the willingness and ability of businesses in the printed textile industry to replace their existing analog printing systems with digital printing systems. The adoption of digital textile printing is dependent to some extent on the growth of “fast fashion,” and has also benefited from sports apparel with shorter production runs, closer geographic proximity to end-use markets, and environmental awareness. A key element of our inkjet textile printing growth strategy is to market digital inkjet printing systems to contract printers that serve major textile brand owners and fashion designers. We have a dedicated team of textile sales and support personnel located in geographies around the world and leverage a select group of distributors and agents in a number of markets to augment our capabilities.
The ceramic tile industry has undergone a shift from southern Europe (e.g., Spain and Italy) to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. As a result, we operate a Cretaprint sales and support center in Foshan, Guangdong, 
10

China, in addition to our facilities in Spain. Foshan is home to the largest concentration of ceramic tile manufacturers in China.
We promote our Industrial Inkjet products through public relations, direct mail, advertising, promotional material, trade shows, and ongoing customer communication programs. The majority of sales leads for our inkjet printer sales are generated from trade shows, including our recent 20th EFI Connect User Conference held in January 2019 in Las Vegas, NV, at which our management and sales force interacted with existing and potential customers directly to demonstrate certain products and help customers understand our product capabilities through workshops, exhibits, and keynote speeches. 
Productivity Software
Our enterprise resource planning and collaborative supply chain business process automation software solutions within our Productivity Software portfolio are primarily sold directly to end users by our direct sales force. An additional distribution channel for our Productivity Software products is through sales by authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers who in turn sell the software solutions to end users either stand-alone or bundled with other solutions they offer.
We have distribution agreements with some of these channel partners, including Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, Xerox, Esko, and Veritiv (formerly xpedx). There are a number of small private resellers of our business process automation software in different geographic regions throughout the world where a direct sales force is not cost-effective. We sell Optitex directly to the leading fashion brands and manufacturers through a direct sales force and distribution channels consisting of authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers.
Fiery
The primary distribution channel for our Fiery products is through our direct relationships with several leading printer manufacturers. We work closely together to design, develop, and integrate Fiery DFE and software technology to maximize the capability of each print engine. The printer manufacturers act as distributors and sell Fiery products to end customers through reseller channels. End customer and reseller channel preference for our Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand for Fiery products through the printer manufacturers.
Our relationships with the leading printer and copier industry companies are important to our business and we have established relationships with Canon, Seiko Epson, Fuji Xerox, Kodak, Konica Minolta, Kyocera Document Solutions, Landa, OKI Data, Ricoh, Riso, Sharp, Toshiba, and Xerox. These relationships are based on business relationships that have been established over time. As of December 31, 2018, our agreements generally do not require them to make any future purchases from us. They are generally free to purchase and offer products from our competitors, or build their own products for sale to the end customer, or cease purchasing our products at any time, for any reason, or no reason.
Fiery Self Serve is our self-service and payment solution that is sold to Canon, FedEx Office, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, Staples, and Xerox. Fiery Self Serve is also marketed to college campuses and libraries.
We sell our proofing products primarily to authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers who in turn sell the solutions to end users either stand-alone or bundled with other solutions they offer. Primary customers with whom we have established distribution agreements include Canon, Epson, Xerox, and Heidelberg. We sell color matching, color palette creation, and print design software to the fashion industry. There can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully distribute our products through these channels.
Growth and Expansion Strategies
The growth and expansion of our revenue will be derived from (i) product innovation through internal development efforts or business acquisition, (ii) increasing market coverage through internal efforts or business acquisition, (iii) expanding the addressable market, and (iv) establishing enterprise coherence and leveraging industry standardization.

We have also established global relationships with many of the leading print providers, such as R.R. Donnelley, FedEx Office, and Staples. These direct sales relationships, along with dealer arrangements, are important for our understanding of the end markets for our products and serve as a source of future product development ideas. In many cases, our products are customized for the needs of large customers yet maintain the common intuitive interfaces that we are known for around the world.
Increasing Market Coverage. We are increasing our market coverage through penetration of our sales and distribution networks, expansion into emerging markets in China, India, Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”), and acquisitions that are synergistic with our other businesses such as the Generation Digital and Escada acquisitions. The Generation Digital textile design workflow is integrated with our Fiery textile DFEs and Reggiani digital textile printers linking textile design and production. Escada offers the corrugated packaging market corrugation control systems, which provide comprehensive control and traceability for the entire corrugation process and can ensure better quality corrugated materials are consumed by our Nozomi digital printers.
Expanding the Addressable Market. We are expanding our addressable market by extending into new markets within each of our operating segments. Further growth in the addressable markets for Industrial Inkjet, Productivity Software, and Fiery has been driven by our integration of the production workflow among these operating segments. Growth in the addressable market for corrugated packaging has resulted from our new Nozomi printer and we expect our new Bolt textile printer to expand our addressable market in textile production.
Establishing Enterprise Coherence and Leveraging Industry Standardization. Our goal is to offer best in class solutions that are inter-operable and conform to open standards, which will allow customers to configure the most efficient solution for their business by establishing enterprise coherence and leveraging industry standardization.
We establish coherence across our product lines by designing products and platforms that provide a consistent “look and feel” to the end user. Cross-product coherence creates higher productivity levels as a result of shortened learning curves. The integration that end users can achieve using our products for all of their digital printing and imaging needs leads to a lower total cost of ownership. Open architecture utilizing industry-established standards to provide interoperability across a range of digital printing devices and software applications ultimately provides end users with more choice and flexibility in their selection of products with advantages when a customer selects an EFI product as part of that architecture. For example, integration between our cloud-based Digital StoreFront application, our Pace business process automation application, and our Fiery XF Production Color RIP including integration to our Fiery or VUTEk product lines, is achieved by leveraging the industry standard Job Definition Format. Our Productivity Suite has taken this integration further through end-to-end automation including certified workflows and synchronized releases across multiple products consisting of our Packaging Suite, Corrugated Packaging Suite, Enterprise Commercial Print Suite, Publication Print Suite, Midmarket Print Suite, Quick Print Suite, and Value Added Products.
Recent Business Acquisitions. We achieve product innovation through internal research and development efforts, as well as by acquiring businesses with technology that is synergistic with our product lines and may be attractive to our customers. We also acquire businesses to expand our market coverage and customer base. 
12

Recent business acquisitions are summarized as follows: 

Year | Acquired Business | Acquired Product Line or Customer Base 
2018 | None | 
2017 | FFPS | FFPS servers and customer base 
 | CRC Information Systems (“CRC”) | North America print MIS customer base 
 | Generation Digital | Software for textile and fashion designers 
 | Escada | Machine control for corrugated packaging systems 
2016 | Rialco | Dye powders and color products for digital printing and industrial manufacturing
 | Optitex | Integrated 3D design software 

We intend to continue to make strategic acquisitions in the future that support our product innovation, market coverage, and total addressable market expansion strategies.
Backlog
Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our significant printer manufacturer customers in our Fiery operating segment, these customers typically do not issue such purchase orders until 30 to 90 days before shipment. The non-linear nature of our Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software operating segments results in limited customer contracts and purchase orders that are not shipped at the end of the period, which are not material and are not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. See also Note 4 - Revenue of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Significant Relationships
We have established and continue to build and expand relationships with the leading printer manufacturers and distributors of digital printing technology to benefit from their products, distribution channels, and marketing resources. Our customers include domestic and international manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of digital printers. We work closely with the leading printer manufacturers to develop solutions that incorporate leading technology and work optimally in conjunction with their products. The top revenue-generating printer manufacturers, that we sold products to in 2018, in alphabetical order, were Canon, Fuji Xerox, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Landa, OKI Data, Ricoh, Sharp, Toshiba, Seiko Epson, and Xerox Document Solutions. Because sales of our printer and copier-related products constitute a significant portion of our Fiery revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect to continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. Revenue from these leading printer manufacturers was 22%, 26%, and 28% of our consolidated revenue, during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
We customarily enter into development and distribution agreements with our significant printer manufacturer customers. These agreements can be terminated under a range of circumstances and often on relatively short notice. The circumstances under which an agreement can be terminated vary from agreement to agreement and there can be no assurance that these significant printer manufacturers will continue to purchase products from us in the future, despite such agreements. Our agreements generally do not commit such customers to make future purchases from us. They could decline to purchase products from us in the future and could purchase and offer products from our competitors, or develop their own products for sale to the end customer. We recognize the importance of, and strive to maintain, our relationships with the leading printer manufacturers. Relationships with these companies are affected by a number of factors including, among others: competition from other suppliers, competition from their own internal development efforts, and changes in general economic, competitive, or market conditions including changes in demand for our products, changes in demand for the printer manufacturers’ products, industry consolidation, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain or build the relationships we have developed to date. 
We have a continuing relationship pursuant to a license agreement with Adobe Systems, Inc. (“Adobe”). We license PostScript® software from Adobe for use in many of our Fiery solutions under the OEM Distribution and License Agreement 
13

entered into in September 2005, as amended from time to time. Under our agreement with Adobe, we have a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Adobe deliverables (including any software, development tools, utilities, software development kits, fonts, drivers, documentation, or related materials). The scope of additional licensing terms varies depending on the type of Adobe deliverable. Our agreement with Adobe was amended on February 1, 2018, to automatically renew annually. The agreement can be terminated by either party upon 120 days prior written notice. All royalties due to Adobe under the agreement are payable within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
Each Fiery solution requires page description language software provided by Adobe, which is a leader in providing page description software. Adobe’s PostScript® software is widely used to manage the geometry, shape, and typography of hard copy documents. Adobe can terminate our current PostScript® software license agreement without cause. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobe’s PostScript® software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript® software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, to obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain quality assurance approvals from them for our products that use Adobe software. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship with Adobe is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript® software. If that occurred, we would have to license, acquire, develop, or re-establish our own competing software as a viable alternative for Adobe PostScript® software and our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed for a period of time. 
Our industrial inkjet printers require inkjet print heads that are manufactured by a limited number of suppliers. If we experience difficulty obtaining print heads, our inkjet printer production would be limited. In addition, we manufacture UV curable, textile digital, and ceramic digital ink for use in our printers and rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain pigments and other components used in our ink. Our ink sales would decline significantly if we were unable to obtain the pigments and other components when needed. 
Corporate Responsibilities and Environmental Sustainability
We have taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and products and to promote sustainability. Our efforts include the following:

• | Transitioning from chemical-based to water-based inks. We have expended considerable resources in the development of water-based inks and printers that can use them. We have introduced new water-based printers and inks and are developing additional products using water-based technology. These printers can reduce emissions from the curing process which would otherwise result in greenhouse gases.


• | Transitioning printer ink curing technology from mercury vapor UV lamps to LED UV lamps. Our display graphics and corrugated printres offer LED "cool cure" technology. LED technology uses less heat than the traditional curing process resulting in increased uptime and greater reliability. Energy assessments conducted by the Fogra Graphic Technology Research Association have shown that our super-wide format printers with LED curing can reduce energy consumption by up to 82% when compared with printers that use conventional mercury arc lamps.Transition to LED UV lamp curing also has the additional benefits of reducing ozone created during the curing process as well as the ability to use thinner substrates. The use of thinner substrates reduces the material load used in the overall image and the substrate thickness by over 30% compared to standard mercury UV lamp systems. In addition, use of LED UV lamps in our printers reduces the amount of landfill waste because LED UV lamps generally last about 16,000 hours before replacement, whereas mercury vapor UV lamps typically only last about 1000 hours before replacement.


• | Reggiani Sustainability Initiatives. Our textile business is a worldwide provider of complete solutions for the textile market, with a focus on the development of sustainable processes. All our industrial printers can be used with a complete range of water-based inks. In 2010, we undertook a certification process as a commitment to our customers in order to offer eco-sustainable processes guaranteed by “Green Label” certification issued by the Association of Italian Textile Machinery Manufacturers, a private non-profit association. EFI Reggiani’s innovations are the result of extensive research targeted to improve productivity and quality, optimize the textile manufacturing process, and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as environmental impact. For example, our TERRA pigment solution is a unique in-line polymerization process for faster, greener printing that eliminates the need for steaming or washing on

14

direct-to-textile applications. As a result, users can achieve superior printing results while using less time, water and energy.
We are committed to sustainable business practices and products and will continue our efforts to proactively evaluate any potential changes that will benefit the environment.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 3,400 full time employees.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2018, 1,200 of our 3,400 full-time employees were involved in research and development. We believe that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success. We intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development, as well as improvements to existing products. New platforms and ink formulations will continue to be developed for our Industrial Inkjet products as the industry accelerates its transition from analog to digital technology, from solvent-based printing to UV curable ink printing, and adopts digital textile printing due to the growth of “fast fashion.” We are developing new software applications designed to maximize work flow efficiencies and meet the needs of the graphic arts, packaging, and commercial print professions, including business process automation, web-to-print, e-commerce, cross-media marketing, imposition, proofing solutions, and 3D textile CAD applications. We are developing products to support additional printing devices including high-end color copiers and multi-functional devices. We have research and development sites in numerous U.S. locations, as well as in India, Europe, Israel, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Brazil, and Canada. Substantial additional expense is expected to be required to complete and bring to market products that are currently under development.
Manufacturing
We are leveraging efficiencies in our worldwide digital inkjet printer manufacturing operations by centralizing certain aspects of our product manufacturing. Our VUTEk display graphics super-wide, wide format industrial hybrid and flatbed inkjet printers were primarily manufactured in our Meredith, New Hampshire facility until March 2018. Starting in April 2018, we began to manufacture these printers in our new facility in Manchester, New Hampshire. In 2016, we transferred VUTEk roll-to-roll printer production to our Rosh Ha’Ayin, Israel, facility, our FabriVU textile digital inkjet printer production to our Bergamo, Italy, facility, and certain wide format industrial digital inkjet printers to our Castellon, Spain, facility.
We utilize subcontractors to manufacture our Fiery products and, to a lesser extent, our super-wide and wide format industrial printers. These subcontractors work closely with us to promote low cost and high quality while manufacturing our products. Subcontractors purchase components needed for our products from third parties. We are dependent on the ability of our subcontractors to produce the products we sell. Although we supervise our subcontractors, there can be no assurance that such subcontractors will perform efficiently or effectively. We have outsourced our Fiery production with Avnet, Inc. (“Avnet”), formulation of ceramic ink to two subcontractors, and formulation of textile ink to third party branded suppliers, with the exception of reactive dye textile ink, which we formulate in our Bedford, U.K. facility.
Should our subcontractors experience inability or unwillingness to manufacture or deliver our products, then our business, financial condition, and operations could be harmed. Since we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our subcontractors and such agreements may be terminated with relatively short notice, any of our subcontractors could terminate their relationship with us and/or enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit them from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability or unwillingness to fill our orders in a timely manner or at all. 
Our VUTEk roll-to-roll super-wide format industrial printers are manufactured in a single location in our Rosh Ha’Ayin, Israel facility. Our Reggiani textile industrial printers are manufactured in a single location in our Bergamo, Italy facility. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration and Nozomi corrugated packaging printers are manufactured in a single location in our Castellon, Spain facility. Our UV curable and LED curable digital ink that is used in our display graphics super-wide and wide-format industrial digital inkjet printers are formulated in a single location in our Ypsilanti, Michigan facility. Our 
15

reactive dye ink that is used in our textile digital inkjet printers is formulated in a single location in our Bedford, U.K., facility.
Most components used to manufacture our printers and ink are available from multiple suppliers, except for inkjet print heads, branded textile ink, and certain key ingredients (primarily pigments and photoinitiators) for our digital UV curable ink. Although typically in low volumes, many key components are sourced from single vendors. If we were unable to obtain the print heads currently used, we would be required to redesign our printers to use different print heads. If we were unable to obtain the branded textile ink or the components required for our digital ceramic, digital textile, or digital UV curable inks, we would have to qualify other sources, if possible, or reformulate and test the new ink formulations. In our Industrial Inkjet facilities, we use hazardous materials to formulate digital UV curable, digital textile, and ceramic digital ink, as well as store internally formulated and third-party ink. The storage, use, and disposal of those materials must meet the requirements of various environmental regulations.
Significant components necessary for manufacturing our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We depend largely on the following sole and limited source suppliers for our components and manufacturing services:

Supplier | Components 
Intel | Central processing units (“CPUs”); chip sets 
Toshiba | Application-specific integrated circuits (“ASIC”) & inkjet print heads
Open Silicon | ASICs 
Altera | ASICs & programmable devices 
Tundra | Chip sets 
Avnet | Electric components, Contract manufacturing (Fiery) 
Adobe | PostScript® (Fiery and Productivity Software) 
Dell Electronics | Contract manufacturing (FFPS) 
HCL Technologies | Sustaining engineering (FFPS) 
Third party branded: DuPont, Huntsman, Sensient | Textile ink 
Ink pigment and component suppliers | Ink pigments, photoinitiators, and other components 
Columbia Tech | Inkjet sub-assemblies 
Schneider Electric | Inkjet electrical sub-assemblies 
Phoseon | LED lamps 
Shenzhen Runtianzhi Tech | Inkjet sub-assemblies 
Seiko | Inkjet print heads 
Xaar | Inkjet print heads 
Ricoh | Inkjet print heads 
Kyocera Mita | Inkjet print heads 
Progress Software | Monarch and Radius operating system 
Printable | Digital StoreFront modular offering 
Enabling Technologies Ltd | Sensor interface and electronics 

We generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our component suppliers. We primarily conduct business with such suppliers largely on a purchase order basis. If any of our sole or limited source suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply us with the components for which we rely on them, we may be unable to continue manufacturing our products utilizing such components.

Competition
Competition in our markets is significant and involves rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must continue to develop and introduce new products and features on a timely and cost-effective basis to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and the product offerings of our competitors. We believe the principal competitive factor affecting our markets is the market acceptance rates for new printing technology.
Industrial Inkjet
Our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers compete with printers produced by Agfa, Durst, Canon, Hewlett-Packard (“HP”), Inca, Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh throughout most of the world. There are also Chinese and Korean printer manufacturers in the marketplace, but their products are typically sold in their domestic markets and are not currently perceived as viable alternatives in most other markets, given product quality and more limited after-sales service and support. Our UV and LED curable ink is sold to users of our UV industrial inkjet printers, which have advanced quality control systems to ensure that correct color and non-expired ink is used to prevent damage to the printer. This results in most ink used in our printers being sold by us. While third party ink is available, its use may compromise the printer’s quality control system and also voids certain provisions of our printer warranty and service contracts. Our Nozomi corrugated packaging digital inkjet printers compete with printers offered by Barberan, Durst, HP, and Sun Automation.
Our Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers compete with Dover, Durst, Mimaki, Roland, Epson, Konica Minolta, Robustelli, Atexco, Shenzhen Homer Textile, Kornit, Ricoh, and Digital Graphics. Competitive digital inkjet textile printers are manufactured in Italy, Japan, China, and smaller emerging markets such as Indonesia. Key competitors driving digitalization of the textile printer market include Dover and Kornit. Reggiani also competes with other digital inkjet textile printing technologies including pre-washing and post-washing printing techniques.
Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers compete with ceramic tile decoration printers manufactured in Spain (KERAjet), Austria (Durst), Italy (Technoferrari, Projecta, Intesa, and System), China (Flora, Hope, Meijia, and Teckwin), and smaller emerging competition in other markets such as Indonesia. The ceramic tile industry has experienced a relocation from southern Europe to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia, among others. Competition in the Chinese market consists of small Chinese ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers and European manufacturers that are reducing prices to gain market share. 
Productivity Software
Our Productivity Software segment, which includes our business process automation, cloud-based order entry and order management systems, cross media marketing, and imposition solution systems faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing and packaging industries. These vendors are typically small, privately-owned companies. We also face competition from larger vendors that currently offer, or are seeking to develop, business process automation printing products including HP, Epicor, and SAP. We face competition from Oracle, SAP, Kiwiplan, and Heidelberg in the packaging software market.
Our Optitex 3D CAD software competes with Lectra, Assyst, CLO, Browzwear, and Gerber. Optitex provides 2D CAD design and 3D CAD visualization in the same application. Therefore, the CAD information and the 3D information are tightly integrated. Furthermore, the incremental learning curve from using 2D to using 3D is minimal.
Fiery
The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our Fiery solutions include customer service and support, product reputation, quality, performance, price, and product features such as functionality, scalability, ease of use, and ability to interface with products produced by the significant printer manufacturers. Although we have direct relationships with each of the leading printer manufacturers and work closely with them to integrate Fiery DFE and software technology into the design and development of their print engines to maximize their quality and capability, our primary competitors for stand-alone color DFEs, embedded DFEs, and design-licensed solutions are these same leading printer manufacturing companies. They 
17

each maintain substantial investments in research and development. Some of this investment is targeted at integrating products and technology that we have designed and some of this investment is targeted at developing products and technology that compete with our Fiery brand. 
We are the largest third party DFE developer, although our market compared with DFEs developed internally by the leading printer manufacturers, since we primarily focus on production printers, rather than office or consumer printers, is small. We believe that our advantages include continuously advancing technology, short time-to-market, brand recognition, end user loyalty, sizable installed base, number of products supported, price driven by lower development costs, and market knowledge. We intend to continue to develop new DFEs with capabilities that meet the changing needs of the printer manufacturers’ product development road maps. Although we do not directly control the distribution channels, we provide a variety of features as well as unique “look and feel” to the printer manufacturers’ products to differentiate our customers’ products from those of their competitors. Ultimately, we believe that end customer and reseller channel preference for the Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand for Fiery products through the printer manufacturers.
Intellectual Property Rights
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws; non-disclosure agreements; and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights. Although we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business, no single patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret is solely responsible for the development and manufacturing of our products.
We are currently pursuing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions to protect various inventions. Over time, we have accumulated a portfolio of patents issued in these jurisdictions. We own or have rights to the copyrights of the software code in our products and rights to the trademarks under which our products are marketed. We have registered certain trademarks in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate.
Certain of our products include intellectual property licensed from our customers. We have also granted and may continue to grant licenses to our intellectual property, when and as we deem appropriate.
