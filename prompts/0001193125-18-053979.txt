--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths 
 We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for each of the CA and BA markets. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: 

 | Leading Performance. Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best inflight Internet experience across the broadest range of aircraft, wherever they fly with the highest network and system availability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We offer the broadest array of inflight connectivity technologies in the market, including 2Ku, Ku, ATG-4/ATG, AVANCE L5 and Iridium. We expect ATG-NG to be commercially available in 2018. In January 2018, BA announced AVANCE L3 (AVANCE L3), a compact AVANCE L5 system modified for small business aircraft, that is also expected to be commercially available in 2018. We are the only inflight connectivity provider to offer both air-to-ground and satellite-based solutions and our satellite network offers the most comprehensive global coverage in our industry. The breadth of our technologies allows our customers to select the best solution based on aircraft size and route  serving everything from smaller BA aircraft to the largest widebody CA aircraft. 
 Our latest generation global satellite solution, 2Ku, is the most rapidly adopted inflight connectivity system in our industry. 2Ku is capable of delivering peak speeds to the aircraft of 100 Mbps, and its speed is expected to increase as HTS and our next generation modem are deployed. 2Ku enables end users to enjoy a ground-like experience, including streaming and other bandwidth-intensive applications. It employs two low-profile satellite antennas with higher spectral efficiency, superior equatorial performance, and lower drag and fuel burn as compared to competing satellite antennas. 
 When ATG-NG becomes available, it will bring speeds similar to 2Kus to BA aircraft and CA regional jet aircraft in North America. It will also benefit the user experience by providing the low latency of a ground-
 
6 


  based network. Airlines and aircraft owners and operators will benefit from its light weight and easy installation when compared to larger, satellite-based systems. 
 

 | Continuous Innovation. We design our solutions to provide leading performance and to last for many years, with a modular technology architecture that enables adoption of new technology while minimizing the impact of hardware changes on aircraft.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 2Ku system is designed to access maximum satellite capacity, and its open architecture enables us to obtain satellite capacity from multiple existing and anticipated satellites operated by multiple providers, thereby enabling our aviation partners to offer leading performance for many years without the need for antenna swaps or other invasive changes to the aircraft. This open architecture is facilitated by our proprietary antenna system and our investments in modem and antenna positioner hardware and software. Our strategy does not include owning or operating satellites. By leasing satellite capacity, we maximize our flexibility to adopt rapid innovations in satellites and to obtain capacity when, where and in the amount required by our aviation customers. We expect continued rapid innovation in satellites to yield improved global coverage and redundancy, increased capacity and peak speed, and lower latency. With approximately 80% of the commercial air traffic concentrated in less than 20% of the global airspace, our multi-provider, multi-satellite approach most efficiently matches supply with demand. 
 We also recently introduced a proprietary next generation modem into CA service, which enhances our 2Ku and Ku solutions. Our new modem was installed on 284 aircraft at December 31, 2017 and is expected to be on all 2Ku and Ku aircraft by the end of 2018. This modem is capable of increasing throughput from the satellite to the aircraft by approximately 16 times as compared to our prior generation modem, and greatly reduces hand-off time between satellites compared to our previous generation modem. 
 We continue to innovate and have a strong track record. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for more than 25 years, as evidenced by the nine network technologies, six of which are proprietary to Gogo, that we have deployed during this time. In addition, we hold more than 100 patents, most of which relate to network technology. In addition to the ongoing development of ATG-NG, which has achieved peak speeds in excess of 100 Mbps in testing, we are developing a fully electronic phased array antenna and conducting research and development in areas that include the use of LEO satellite capacity. Our expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $78.1 million, $45.9 million and $50.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 

 | Customer-Focus. We provide a hardware and software platform that allows connectivity-enabled services to be deployed quickly, easily and flexibly across all of our networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gogo supports airline partners with customized portals and applications. These portals are managed by Gogo or by third parties that rely on Gogos platform for many functions, including user accounts and passwords, payments, entertainment and other stored content. These capabilities are common regardless of which network the aircraft operates on, enabling our airline partners to bring their customized user experiences to their full fleets. In 2017, our platform powered customized portals for fourteen airlines. 
 Our AVANCE system provides BA customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers inflight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE system enables BA owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. 
 Additionally, both our CA and BA platforms provide hosting, reporting, data labels, storage and other capabilities for an increasing array of CAS applications from a variety of third-party partners. 
 

 | Long-Term Support. There are unique requirements that separate aviation from terrestrial markets and we have the necessary scale and expertise to address this market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gogo supports the largest fleet of connected aircraft and we have acquired significant technological and operational expertise and developed long-term and robust supplier relationships in both business and 
 
7 


  commercial aviation. In commercial aviation, we have the capability to install ATG equipment overnight and satellite solutions in less than two days, and to deploy software upgrades remotely. Currently, we have 28 installation lines and 16 installation locations in operation around the globe. After installation, our support continues and in 2017, we provided maintenance services for customer aircraft that flew more than 4.5 million flights to or from six continents. 
 Growth Strategy 
 The four key drivers fueling Gogos growth and financial performance are: increasing the number of Gogo-connected aircraft, increasing average revenue per aircraft, reducing investment per aircraft and improving margins. 
 Increase Number of Gogo-Connected Aircraft 
 Less than half of the global fleet of approximately 21,000 commercial aircraft and less than 20% of the global fleet of more than 35,000 business aircraft are currently broadband connected. We anticipate that approximately 18,000 additional commercial aircraft will be broadband connected over the next 10 years. These new connections will increasingly occur on new aircraft through the OEM channel. We expect that nearly all of the worlds commercial aircraft and a rapidly increasing percentage of business aircraft will be broadband connected over the next decade. In 2017, we activated approximately 800 aircraft in CA and BA, representing approximately 55% of aircraft brought online within the industry. 
 

 | Commercial Aviation. As of December 31, 2017, we provided our connectivity services on 3,231 commercial aircraft, an increase of approximately 10% from the prior year. Based on the strength of our comprehensive portfolio, we expect to continue to sign contracts with airlines to equip existing and new aircraft. We made substantial progress towards meeting the factory installation requirements of Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier in 2017 and expect an increasing number of installations through the OEM channel. During 2017, four Airbus A350 aircraft were delivered with our 2Ku system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Business Aviation. As of December 31, 2017, the business aviation market was comprised of approximately 23,000 business aircraft in North America and approximately 7,700 business aircraft in the rest of the world, and we had approximately 4,700 business aircraft online with broadband connectivity, principally in North America. We increased the number of broadband business aircraft online by more than 500 in 2017. A significant number of BA aircraft are new aircraft on which our systems are installed and sold by OEMs that include Beechcraft, Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Learjet. During 2017, we introduced, sold and installed AVANCE L5, an integrated and customizable inflight system that employs our ATG-4 network in North America and is faster than our Gogo Biz solution, and announced a new global Ku-based satellite solution for larger, long range business jets, which is expected to be commercially available in 2018. In January 2018, we announced AVANCE L3, a more compact integrated, customizable inflight system that uses our ATG network and is targeted at light jets and turbo props in North America. By leveraging networks shared with CA, we now have inflight systems that address nearly all segments of the business aviation market. Our ability to provide CAS and our flexibility in providing various pricing options further support our strategy of targeting various segments of the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Average Revenue per Aircraft 
 We expect to continue to grow average revenue per aircraft (ARPA) by increasing the take rates for passenger connectivity and the adoption of additional services, including entertainment and CAS. 
 Our strategies for growing ARPA include the following: 
 

 | Increase Passenger Adoption of Connectivity. We intend to leverage our existing technology and ATG-NG to continue to enhance the passenger experience and the number and quality of available services. Our
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 


 
mission is to provide all passengers on every flight a ground-like experience, including video streaming. We expect to engage additional passengers and grow ARPA through a combination of multiple tiers of service and multiple payers. In BA, we continue to introduce a variety of broadband and voice services and related pricing plans, allowing aircraft operators and owners various options based on data usage, flight frequency and the number and size of aircraft serviced. In CA, the increased bandwidth of 2Ku supports tiered services such as messaging, browsing and streaming, enabling a variety of experiences and price points for passengers. Airlines provide amenities to passengers using segmentation based on cabin seating, ticket prices and other factors, and we expect our service revenue from airlines to grow as they increasingly purchase bandwidth to provide complimentary service for some or all of their passengers. We also expect service revenue from third parties to continue to grow. For example, we are currently engaged by T-Mobile to make our inflight services available to its subscribers, and we expect other terrestrial mobile carriers and other companies, such as credit card providers, to enter into similar arrangements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Adoption of Wireless Entertainment. Gogo Vision was available on nearly all Gogo-connected aircraft in CA and approximately 320 BA aircraft as of December 31, 2017. Through our Gogo Vision platform, airlines offer passengers a library of movies and TV shows for wireless streaming to personal devices. In 2017, most of our airline customers transitioned from the Gogo Vision passenger-paid model to a free-to-passenger model under which the airlines pay Gogo on a monthly basis or per view basis. Due in large part to this transition, Gogo Vision had more than 40 million views in 2017, double the prior year. We expect wireless entertainment views to continue to grow rapidly, driven by increased awareness of the service, additional content, integration with seatback screens and introduction of Gogo TV. Additionally, we expect our recent deployment of Gogo TV, which delivers live content streamed directly to wireless devices, and our planned deployment of Gogo Vision Touch with Delta Air Lines to drive increased adoption of wireless entertainment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Adoption of CAS. We expect that the demand by airlines for connectivity-based applications that improve the passenger experience and operational efficiency will increase over the next several years. This trend will drive data usage on our network and demand for platform services from Gogo. We are interfacing our equipment with the data buses on aircraft and are developing the hardware and software platforms that facilitate the development and deployment of applications. CAS currently supports aircraft crew devices and enables pilots and crew to utilize the following services: location tracking, aircraft data analytics, route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reduce Our Investment per Aircraft 
 In CA, we define investment per aircraft as the installed cost of airborne equipment less the proceeds received from an airline partner. Our investment per aircraft varies depending on the commercial terms of our contract with the airline, the technology deployed, and the type of aircraft equipment installed. In 2017, we significantly reduced the installation cost per 2Ku aircraft by shortening the installation time from a week to under two days, and reduced equipment costs through engineering improvements and volume discounts. Our ability to leverage our growing portfolio of STCs will further reduce the cost and time required to install new fleets. We currently have STCs and service bulletins for approximately 80% of the available aircraft types to be equipped with 2Ku. This broad portfolio allows us to reuse STCs to reduce the time and cost required to obtain certification and to accelerate installation schedules. In addition, as 2Kus performance has been demonstrated, the amount of our CA revenue derived from airborne equipment has increased as more 2Ku systems are sold at a price higher than the price of other Gogo systems. As our investment per aircraft declines and ARPA increases, our return on invested capital increases and the payback period is shortened. 
Improve Margins 
 We have made substantial investments in our network, inflight systems, inflight service platforms and aviation partner support in order to serve aircraft operators globally. As we leverage these investments by adding 
 
9 


  aircraft online and increasing revenue per aircraft, our margins will continue to improve in CA-ROW and CA-NA segments driving overall margin expansion. 
 Contracts with Airline Partners 
 In CA, we enter into connectivity agreements with our airline partners under which the airlines commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services, and in some circumstances CAS, on such aircraft. We currently have definitive agreements with 18 commercial airlines. We have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on Gogo-installed aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners from which we derive a substantial majority of our CA revenue. The majority of our contracts with our airline partners have 10-year terms, with staggered expiration dates occurring on a fleet by fleet basis based on installation dates or on a contract basis, depending on the contract. Under our current contracts, the first expiration will occur in 2018 and the last in 2028 or later, depending on the timing of future installations. 
 We offer airline partners a variety of business models and work with each airline to tailor the model to meet its needs. We began our CA business with the turnkey model, under which we provide the airline with the full range of our services, charge the passenger for passenger connectivity or Gogo Vision services at prices we determine and remit to the airline a specified percentage of passenger revenue. Under such model, for satellite-based connectivity services, the airline typically pays Gogo a monthly fee for network monitoring and management services. Under some of our agreements, airlines have adopted or have the option to adopt an airline-directed model, whereby the airline partner has flexibility to determine which of the many end-to-end services it wants Gogo to provide, which services it wants to provide itself and how it wishes to price the services provided to passengers. For example, an airline may elect to be the retailer for inflight connectivity and entertainment services to its passengers, rather than using Gogo as the distributor, or to offer our services on a complimentary basis to some or all of its passengers. In such case, we negotiate the fees the airline pays us for the connectivity and entertainment services provided, the bandwidth consumed, and any other services provided by Gogo. In 2017, airlines operating under the turnkey model generated more than 90% of our CA services revenue, but we expect this percentage to decrease as airlines increasingly adopt the airline-directed and other models. 
 Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. When we provide such services, under some agreements we include charges for installation and maintenance in our equipment pricing package; in other circumstances, the airline pays us directly for such services. In addition, under contracts with airline partners from which we derive a substantial majority of our CA revenue, we are obligated, in certain circumstances, to upgrade or improve the systems or components installed on certain aircraft and to obtain STCs, at our expense. Under certain contracts, we provide equipment credits or other incentives based on the number of aircraft installed with our equipment and the timing of such installations. Our contracts with airline partners set forth specified timelines for the installation or delivery of our airborne equipment, as well as service level commitments, and our failure to meet such timelines or service level commitments generally requires us to pay penalties or liquidated damages to the airlines and in certain circumstances may result in our airline partners being permitted to terminate all or a portion of the contract. 
 As of December 31, 2017, under agreements with nine of our airline partners, the scope of services included Gogo Vision and we are discussing with other airline partners the possibility of providing Gogo Vision on their installed fleets. We also provide certain airline partners content filtering and CAS, such as real-time credit card processing for passenger food and beverage purchases, flight crew access to real-time weather information, electronic flight bags and voice services in the cockpit. 
 Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines accounted for approximately 26% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have three principal contracts with Delta Air Lines. The contract for ATG service on Delta Air Lines mainline and regional jet fleets expires on the 
 
10 


  13-year anniversary of specified installation milestones, which will occur in 2022 and 2025, respectively. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines for Ku-band satellite service on its international fleet and for 2Ku service will expire in 2027. 
 Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by American Airlines (including legacy US Airways aircraft) accounted for approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. On February 24, 2017, we replaced our multiple contracts with American Airlines (including the contract originally entered into with US Airways) with one unified agreement (the Unified Agreement) covering aircraft installed or to be installed with our ATG and ATG-4 technologies and to be installed with our 2Ku technology. The Unified Agreement has different expiration dates for different fleet types. Generally, the term for each fleet type, other than those on which 2Ku will be installed, expires on the 10-year anniversary of the date on which 90% of such fleet type has been installed with our ATG equipment, or when the fleet types are retired or deinstalled, with the first expiration date occurring in 2019 and the last in 2025. The Unified Agreement will expire with respect to the 2Ku-installed fleet in 2019. 
 Each of our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines provides for early termination by the airline in specified circumstances and allows the airline to terminate the contract should the percentage of passengers using the Gogo service on the airlines flights not meet certain thresholds. We currently experience, and for the last five years have experienced, connectivity take rates in excess of those thresholds. In addition, under the Unified Agreement, American Airlines has the option to terminate Gogo service, and we expect it to exercise such option, on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG/ATG-4 service is provided. We currently expect more than 400 such aircraft to be deinstalled in 2018 and early 2019. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit these airlines to terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of other certain contractually stipulated events, including our failure to meet service level requirements and the circumstance in which another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over our passenger connectivity service, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit the airline to terminate the agreement with respect to certain fleets on specified dates, subject to payment of a specified termination fee. If our contracts with Delta Air Lines or American Airlines were to be terminated in whole or in significant part for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 No other contract accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Competition 
 Commercial Aviation 
 Our key competitors include Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Inmarsat, OnAir, Panasonic Avionics Corp., Rockwell Collins/ARINC, Thales, ViaSat and Zodiac Inflight Innovations, all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide inflight connectivity and/or entertainment. We are the only telecommunications company focused exclusively on global aviation and its unique connectivity requirements. We believe that our competitive advantages include our (i) breadth of technological solutions; (ii) global coverage; (iii) operational excellence; and (iv) variety of business models we offer to airlines. Some of our competitors already offer their equipment as standard line-fit options on various aircraft types. The strategic priorities, offerings and capabilities of our competitors vary, including the variety of technologies available for various aircraft types, the ability to offer inflight Internet solutions and video entertainment offerings, the ability to cost-effectively provide offerings on a global basis, the ability to manage capacity constraints, and the ability to offer, incorporate and manage new inflight connectivity technologies and solutions as they become available.

 Business Aviation 
 We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Rockwell Collins, Satcom Direct and ViaSat. Also, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Panasonic Avionics Corp. and SmartSky Networks have announced that they intend to enter the business aviation market. 
Licenses and Regulation 
 Federal Aviation Administration 
 The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We regularly obtain STCs for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines. 
 After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facilitys production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. 
 Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a No Hazard Determination for our cell sites which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites we may first be required to obtain such a determination. 
 Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. 
 In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. 
 Foreign Aviation Regulation 
 According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (CAAs) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered 
 
12 


  aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. 
 The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (BAA) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness (IPA) provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircrafts country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate (VSTC). For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partners service in any country in which they register aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners fleets. 
 U.S. Department of Transportation 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including inflight entertainment (IFE) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. Since a final rule on IFE has not been issued, however, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. 
 Federal Communications Commission 
 Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCCs prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. 
 Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, our BA business provides some of its voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, our BA segment provides an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. 
 We offer connectivity service in the United States to commercial and business aviation aircraft through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license that operates in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See ATG License Terms and Conditions. 
 Since June 12, 2015, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services have been classified as Title II telecommunications services, subject to FCC common carrier regulation and broad net neutrality rules pursuant 
 
13 


  to an FCC order released March 12, 2015 (Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibits broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contain an exception for reasonable network management. The Open Internet Order recognizes that whether a network management practice is reasonable varies according to the broadband technology involved, and we believe provides more flexibility to implement network management. 
 The Open Internet Order also imposes disclosure requirements on broadband providers, including more granular network performance reporting requirements. The FCC exempted smaller providers, such as Gogo, from its enhanced disclosure requirements until March 2022. 
 However, on January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order (Restoring Internet Freedom Order) that will repeal most of the Open Internet Order, reclassify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier information service, and remove virtually all of the compliance obligations that the Open Internet Order imposes on our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services. The Restoring Internet Freedom Order has not gone into effect as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and it is expected to be subject to additional judicial and executive branch review. Under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. Gogo continues to evaluate its possible remaining obligations under the new rules. 
 Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCCs data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (CMDS) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft, and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be commercially reasonable. The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. Neither the Open Internet Order nor the Restoring Internet Freedom Order altered Gogos obligations with respect to data roaming, but the FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. 
 In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible by persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision service. 
 In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold other FCC licenses, including microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network, two fixed satellite earth station licenses used for network testing and support, one experimental license used for testing equipment, two aircraft radio licenses, an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the U.S. and foreign points, and a non-exclusive license at 3650 MHz, which currently does not authorize operational use and would require registration with the FCC of transmitter site locations prior to commencing use. We also hold a license for blanket authority to operate Ku-band satellite transceivers on up to 2,000 aircraft, which allows us to provide domestic and international broadband service (although some countries require additional authorizations of their own). 
 ATG License Terms and Conditions 
 The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide substantial service to aircraft and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. 
 
14 


 Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no substantial service obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was recently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revises the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. 
 Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. 
 A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a similar agreement between the U.S. and Mexico is in the process of being negotiated. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The renewal of the primary spectrum license will depend upon the satisfaction by Gogo and SkySurf of certain conditions set forth in the license, including, without limitation, a network build-out requirement which has been met. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness and renewal of the primary spectrum license, issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf on June 30, 2009, which expires on June 29, 2019. 
 Prior to spectrum coordination with the ATG licensee in Mexico, the coordination agreement could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Once a provider of air-to-ground services is licensed in Mexico, we hope to negotiate an arrangement that will provide seamless connectivity on flights between Mexico and the U.S. 
 Equipment Certification 
 We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of CA or BA services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCCs technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. 
 Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations 
 As noted above, the Open Internet Order reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services. Certain statutory provisions of Title II now apply to these broadband Internet access services, including provisions that impose consumer privacy protections such as Customer Proprietary Network Information requirements. These provisions will no longer apply to Gogos mobile wireless broadband services upon the effective date of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which reclassifies broadband Internet access as a Title I information service. Notwithstanding the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. 
 We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Although the FTCs authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by 
 
15 


  communications common carriers has not been clearly delineated, FTC officials have publicly stated that they view the FTC as having jurisdiction over Internet service providers non-common carrier services. Some of our services are subject to the FTCs jurisdiction, and upon the effective date of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, we expect that the FTC will have jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that, inter alia: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the companys actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. 
 We collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information is intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website, applicable law and our contractual obligations to airlines, BA customers and other third parties, as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to state mini-FTC Acts, which also prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. 
 While we believe that we have implemented reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information, cyber-attacks on companies have increased in frequency and potential impact in recent years and may be successful despite reasonable precautions and result in substantial potential liabilities. 
 As we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which may result in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring data to countries that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. The United States is a jurisdiction whose processes these countries do not deem adequate for purposes of cross-border personal data transfers. 
 Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and European Union member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Gogo has entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union and Switzerland to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that EU data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation. 
 Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection 
 The FCCs Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our 
 
16 


  satellite-based BA services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. 
 CALEA 
 The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. Our network has been confirmed as compliant with CALEA by a third-party tester as of May 18, 2011. 
Foreign Government Approvals 
 In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service over the airspace of foreign countries or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which a Gogo-equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate (e.g., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating over the airspace of these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on Gogo and/or on its airline partners, allow airline partners affected by such requirements to terminate their contracts with us prior to expiration or, under a contract with one of our airline partners, require us to pay liquidated damages. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time. 
Seasonality 
 The demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. 
 We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we held United States patents expiring on dates ranging from February 2019 to July 2035, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from October 2018 to November 2034. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the 
 
17 


  United States and certain other countries include, among others, Gogo, Gogo Biz and Gogo Vision, although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. 
 We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. 
 We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,244 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
