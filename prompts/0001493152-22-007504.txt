Overview
 
We design and manufacture compact, sustainable electric vehicles for closed campus mobility, low speed urban and community transport, local on-demand and last mile delivery and government use. Our four-wheeled purpose-built electric vehicles are geared toward commercial customers, including universities, business and medical campuses, last mile delivery services and food service providers. We are currently updating our next model year (model year 2023) vehicle lineup in support of the aforementioned markets.
Strategic Review
 
Following the hiring of our new Chief Executive Officer in the third quarter of 2021, we initiated a strategic review of our product development strategy, as we focus on creating value within the electric vehicle, last-mile delivery, and smart payload and enabling infrastructure markets. While we complete our strategic review, we have paused all material research and development activity and expenditures, associated with our planned next-generation three-wheeled high speed vehicle.
 
In December of 2021 we began research and development on the new 411 fleet vehicle model refresh the AYRO Z, including updates on our supply chain evolution, the offshoring/onshoring mix, our manufacturing strategy, and our annual model year refresh program.
 
Products
 
Our vehicles provide the end user an environmentally friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (cars powered by gasoline or diesel oil), for light duty uses, including low-speed logistics, maintenance services, cargo services, and personal/group transport in a quiet, zero emissions vehicle with a lower total cost of ownership.
 
AYRO Club Car 411 and 411x
 
The AYRO Club Car 411 and 411x (the “AYRO 411 Fleet”) is a family of electric, four-wheel, compact, light-duty utility trucks sold exclusively through our contracted partner, Club Car, as part of a global multi-year sustainability solution development, sales and marketing agreement. Each of the AYRO 411 Fleet of vehicles is classified as a street legal low-speed vehicle (“LSV”), defined as a four-wheeled motor vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, that is capable of reaching speeds of at least 20 miles per hour (“mph”) but not greater than 25 mph, with a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 3,000 pounds and meeting the safety standards in Title 49 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, section 571.50.
 
The AYRO 411 Fleet has an expected range of up to 50 miles and a maximum speed range of 25 mph (or 40 kilometers per hour), in line with the United States Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) regulations for LSVs and with most state statutes, which typically limit the speed of LSVs to 25 mph on 35 mph posted roads. The current AYRO 411 Fleet includes:
 

● | the 411x Flatbed truck, which provides users with considerable versatility; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the 411x Pickup truck, generally utilized for open-air hauling; 
● | the 411x Cargo Van Box, a fully enclosed cargo box, which may be internally tailored for use; and 
● | The 411x Powered Cargo Box, in which combinations of refrigeration, warming boxes, beverage dispensers, coffee makers and even wash sinks may be configured.

The AYRO 411 Fleet has zero gas emissions, a full recharge capability of between six and eight hours using 120V/20A outlets and a payload capacity in excess of 1,000 pounds. We estimate that the AYRO 411 Fleet’s operating costs are approximately 50% lower per year compared to similarly sized gas-powered trucks and vans. Vehicles in the AYRO 411 Fleet are equipped with:
 

● | reinforced steel (coated) chassis housing the motor, controller and enclosed battery operating system; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | suspension with transverse leaf spring on the front and horizontal spring with coil-over shock in the rear; 
● | power assisted steering; 
● | street legal if registered and licensed per standard vehicles by dealer or user; 
● | multi-point, anchored DOT compliant safety harnesses for driver and passenger; 
● | a standard back-up camera (appears on larger LCD display – see below); 
● | a standard 7-inch (17.7 centimeter) LCD display; 
● | a standard manual parking brake; 
● | four-wheel all-disk braking system and corrosion resistant body panels; and 
● | heating and ventilation systems in the cabin of the truck. 

 
With its low speed, zero emissions, and cost-effectiveness, the AYRO 411 Fleet seeks to satisfy the needs of a variety of customers, including university and college campuses, retailers, airports and ports, business parks and campuses, warehouses, production facilities, resorts and theme parks, apartment complexes, and adult communities. We have completed model year 2022 enhancements to the AYRO 411, designated the “AYRO 411x,” which saw release in the third quarter of 2021. Development has commenced on the model year 2022 product line, designated the “AYRO Z,” which will represent a major technology refresh, and which will embrace a shift towards a North American sourcing strategy.
 
Three-Wheeled Electric Vehicle Product Offerings
 
In addition to the AYRO 411 Fleet, we previously manufactured and sold the AYRO 311 Autocycle, a compact, three-wheeled electric vehicle (the “AYRO 311”). The AYRO 311 was declared at end-of-life on August 17, 2020. Subsequent to the sale of residual 311 inventory to a third party, on February 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Arcimoto, Inc. to settle certain patent infringement claims (the “Arcimoto Settlement”), pursuant to which we agreed to cease the production, importation and sale of the AYRO 311, among other things. Accordingly, we would not be contractually permitted to resume production of the AYRO 311.
 
We have paused the development of future three-wheeled electric vehicles, originally intended to replace the AYRO 311, in order to focus resources on the development of the AYRO Z, a family of reconfigurable cargo systems tailored for the AYRO Z and the enabling web infrastructure that connects delivery professionals with the clients they serve. We expect to release the model year 2023 AYRO Z and the AYRO Z driver/client harmonization application in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Additional Models, Vehicles, Payloads and Infrastructure
 
We continue to invest in expanding our existing all-electric vehicle technologies, reconfigurable cargo subsystems, onboard and web-based fleet support applications, driver support systems and applications, as well as architectural innovations that maximize subsystem commonality across the AYRO vehicle fleet. Our product line roadmap contemplates growing our fleet of purpose-engineered vehicles and services with every passing model year, with a focus on the low speed vehicle segment, last mile delivery of a plurality of payloads, and potential line extension into efficient, safe micro-mobility platforms.
 
We are also currently in discussions with Club Car regarding a variety of new models and vehicles, and in discussions with a key supply partner in positioning the model year 2023 AYRO Z for sale on the General Services Administration schedule (“GSA Schedule”) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. The GSA Schedule is a long-term governmentwide contract with commercial companies that provide access to millions of commercial products and services at pre-negotiated prices. This would represent an increase of the total addressable market for the Company and further represent a demand hedge to the cyclicality of markets currently addressed.
 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
Manufacturing Agreement with Cenntro
 
In 2017, AYRO Operating partnered with Cenntro Automotive Group, Ltd. (“Cenntro”), which operates a large electric vehicle factory in the automotive district in Hangzhou, China, in a supply chain agreement to provide sub-assembly manufacturing services. Cenntro owns the design of the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles and has granted us an exclusive license to purchase the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles for sale in North America.
 
Under our Manufacturing License Agreement with Cenntro (the “MLA”), in order for us to maintain our exclusive territorial rights pursuant to the MLA, for the first three years after the effective date of March 22, 2020, we must meet the following minimum purchase requirements, which we believe we satisfied for the initial period: (i) a minimum of 300 units sold by the first anniversary of the effective date of the MLA; (ii) a minimum of 800 units sold by the second anniversary of the effective date of the MLA; and (iii) a minimum of 1,300 units sold by the third anniversary of the effective date of the MLA. Cenntro will determine the minimum sale requirements for the years thereafter, should the Company continue utilizing Cenntro as a vehicle supplier. Should any event of default occur, the other party may terminate the MLA by providing written notice to the defaulting party, who will have 90 days from the effective date of the notice to cure the default. Unless waived by the party providing notice, a failure to cure the default(s) within the 90-day time frame will result in the automatic termination of the MLA. Events of default under the MLA include a failure to make a required payment when due, the insolvency or bankruptcy of either party, the subjection of either party’s property to any levy, seizure, general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and a failure to make available or deliver the products in the time and manner provided for in the MLA. Cenntro waived these minimum requirements for 2021.

We import semi-knocked-down vehicle kits from Cenntro for the 411x models comprising our model year 2022 lineup. The vehicle kits are received through shipping containers at the assembly facility of Karma Automotive LLC (“Karma”), our manufacturing partner, in southern California, as well as at our customization, service and integration facility in Round Rock, Texas. The vehicles are then assembled with tailored customization requirements per order. The partnership with Cenntro allows us to scale manufacturing operations without significant investment in capital expenditures, and therefore bring products to market rapidly.
 
The new AYRO Z will utilize assemblies and products that reduce the Company’s dependency on Chinese imports and on-shore the supply chain to North America and European sources.
 
Final Assembly and Integration
 
For final assembly, tailoring, diagnostics testing and service of the 411 and 411x, we currently occupy 24,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space configured in a “U”-shaped assembly line with multiple stations per vehicle in our Round Rock, Texas facility and an equivalent space for final assembly at our manufacturing partner Karma’s plant in southern California. The chart below indicates the number of vehicles that can be assembled per month and the assembly time required for each. Assembly time also includes USDOT quality checks and testing as the final step of the assembly process. The number of vehicles indicated below assumes a single shift.

Vehicle | Assembly time (Man-Hours) | | Vehicle Assembly Capacity per month

Master Procurement Agreement with Club Car
 
In March 2019, we entered into a five-year Master Procurement Agreement (the “MPA”) with Club Car for the sale of our four-wheeled vehicles. The MPA granted Club Car the exclusive right to sell our four-wheeled vehicles in North America, provided that Club Car orders at least 500 vehicles per year.
 
Although Club Car did not meet the volume threshold for 2020 or 2021, we currently have no intention of selling our model year 2022 411x vehicles commercially other than through Club Car. Under the terms of the MPA, we receive orders from Club Car dealers for vehicles of specific configurations, and we invoice Club Car once the vehicle has shipped. The MPA has an initial term of five (5) years commencing January 1, 2019 and may be renewed by Club Car for successive one-year periods upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Pursuant to the MPA, we granted Club Car a right of first refusal for sales of 51% or more of AYRO Operating’s assets or equity interests, which right of first refusal is exercisable for a period of 45 days following delivery of an acquisition notice to Club Car. We also agreed to collaborate with Club Car on new products similar to its four-wheeled vehicle and improvements to existing products and granted Club Car a right of first refusal to purchase similar commercial utility vehicles which AYRO Operating may develop during the term of the MPA.
 
Manufacturing Services Agreement with Karma
 
On September 25, 2020, we entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Karma Agreement”) with Karma, pursuant to which Karma agreed to provide certain manufacturing services for the production of our vehicles. The initial statement of work provides that Karma will perform assembly of a certain quantity of the AYRO 411 vehicles and provide testing, materials management and outbound logistics services. For such services in the initial statement of work, we agreed to pay $1.2 million to Karma, of which (i) $0.52 million was paid at closing and (ii) $0.64 million was due and payable five months following the satisfaction of certain production requirements. This second payment was accrued for as of December 31, 2021.
 
The Karma Agreement expires (i) 12 months from the start of volume production of the vehicles or (ii) such earlier time as the parties mutually agree in writing. In addition, Karma, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Karma Agreement at any time, without cause, upon twelve months’ prior written notice. We may terminate the Karma Agreement, without cause, upon six months’ prior written notice.

Supply Agreement with Gallery Carts
 
During 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Gallery Carts, a leading provider of food and beverage kiosks, carts, and mobile storefront solutions. Joint development efforts have led to the launch of the parties’ first all-electric configurable mobile hospitality vehicle for “on-the-go” venues across the United States. This innovative solution permits food, beverage and merchandising operators to bring goods directly to consumers.
 
The configurable Powered Vendor Box, in the rear of the vehicle, features long-life lithium batteries that power the preconfigured hot/cold beverage and food equipment and is directly integrated with the 411 and 411x. The canopy doors, as well as the full vehicle, can be customized with end-user logos and graphics to enhance the brand experience. Gallery, with 40 years of experience delivering custom food kiosk solutions, has expanded into electric mobile delivery vehicles, as customers increasingly want food, beverages and merchandise delivered to where they are gathering. For example, a recent study conducted by Technomic found that a large majority of students, 77%, desired alternative mobile and to-go food options on campuses.
 
Gallery, a premier distributor of 411 and 411x low-speed electric vehicles manufactured by AYRO, has a diverse clientele throughout mobile food, beverage and merchandise distribution markets, for key customer applications such as university, corporate and government campuses, major league and amateur-level stadiums and arenas, resorts, airports and event centers. In addition to finding innovative and safe ways to deliver food and beverages to their patrons, reducing and ultimately eliminating their carbon footprint is a top priority for many of these customers.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue to develop and commercialize automotive-grade, sustainable electric transportation solutions for the markets and use cases that we believe can be well served by our purpose-built, street legal low speed electric vehicles. Our business strategy includes the following:

● | Leverage the relationship with Club Car to expand our product portfolio and increase our customer base. We are working on and have plans to expand our current electric transportation solutions portfolio in collaboration with Club Car. This plan includes next-generation light duty trucks and new purpose-driven electric vehicles. Additionally, we are collaborating with Club Car’s sales and marketing teams to expand adoption of our vehicles in the United States and intend to expand our geographical footprint within Club Car’s global distribution and channel network. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Scale up our operations to achieve growth. We intend to direct resources to scale up our operations, which we believe is needed to increase our revenue, including expanding and optimizing our automotive component supply chain and our flow-based assembly operations in Round Rock, Texas. Further, we plan to expand sales territories and add distribution channels, forming strategic partnerships to build out our whole product offering across multiple segments and to access additional sales channels or to accelerate product adoption for particular vertical markets, building our brand, and increasing manufacturing capacity to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles. Importantly, we will pursue a strategy to increase our North American content in future vehicle platforms, starting with the model year 2023 AYRO Z. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identify defined markets and use cases which are currently under-served but represent sizable market opportunity sub-sets of the electric vehicle market and focus development efforts on purpose-built electric vehicles to address such markets. We are currently developing a new series of modular, highly reconfigurable payload systems affording operators the maximum flexibility in the use of their fleet for a plurality of payloads. We intend to direct resources to advance the development of such reconfigurable payload solutions which we believe will afford customers the option of sharing transportation assets or configuring those assets differently for differing time of day or time of season use cases. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in research and development and qualification of sensors, cameras, software and mobility services seeking to enhance the value of using our electric vehicles and to derive incremental potential revenue streams for us and our partner ecosystem. We intend to offer a web-based application to accompany every vehicle sold or leased beginning in model year 2023 (expected to be released in October 2022) to enhance the use cases for those vehicles and optimize driver routing, user scheduling, and customer communication. Onboard sensors will collect vehicle health, location data, route data, payload data and environmental data to provide us, the customer and fleet operators the ability to do post-hoc analysis of forecast versus observed delivery efficiency. A subscription service can later be offered even to delivery operators operating vehicles other than ours, creating the potential for an additional revenue stream.

Trends Driving the Need for Electric Vehicles
 
The U.S. electric vehicle market is forecasted to grow substantially in the years ahead, driven by factors such as the country’s increasingly urbanized population, escalating gas prices and increased desirability of non-emissive transportation alternatives.
 
A segment of the electric vehicle market, low speed electric vehicles (“LSEVs”)—which are LSVs but cannot be powered by gas or diesel fuel—are growing increasingly popular as eco-friendly options for consumers and commercial entities. LSEVs run on electric motors fueled by a variety of different batteries, such as lithium ion, molten salt, zinc-air and various nickel-based designs.
 
Trends such as increasingly stringent government regulations aimed toward reducing vehicle emissions, growing urban populations and social pressure to adopt sustainable lifestyles all create a demand for more ecologically and economically sustainable methods of transportation. This demand continues to spur technological advancements and LSEV market growth.
 
Expanding rules and regulations governing vehicle emissions have contributed to growth in the LSEV market. In particular, the U.S., Germany, France, and China have implemented stringent laws and regulations governing vehicular emissions, requiring automobile manufacturers to use advanced technologies to combat high-emission levels in vehicles. To incentivize clean-energy use, many governments are increasingly instituting substantial incentives for consumers to purchase electric vehicles, such as:
 

● | tax credits, rebates, and exemptions; reduced vehicle registration fees; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced utility rates; and 
● | parking incentives. 

 
Further, governments are establishing infrastructure benchmarks to support the growth of the electric vehicle industry.

Competition and Market Opportunities
 
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for economy and alternative fuel vehicles, exhibits a high competitive intensity, especially amongst tier 1 competitors. The relatively modest LSEV market, being smaller in overall size, engenders a more modest competitive intensity. A few notable companies in the global LSEV market include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Ingersoll Rand, Inc., Speedway Electric, AGT Electric Cars, Bintelli Electric Vehicles and Ligier Group. Our relationship with Club Car provides us with distribution strength, affording us the ability to focus our resources on product development, product evolution, and product support.
 
When compared to internal combustion engine vehicle costs, our vehicles are significantly more attractive based on tax, title and license fees. Compared to a standard Ford F150 (gasoline) pickup truck (2.7 liter), the AYRO 411x Fleet provides an approximate 49% reduction in operating expenses and an approximate 100% reduction in CO2 emissions (if renewed energy is used to charge the AYRO vehicles, an increasing trend for most higher education campuses and government facilities).
 
Our closest competitor in the LSEV industry is the WAEV, Inc. (formerly Polaris) Gem (“Gem”). WAEV offers multiple passenger vehicle models and multiple utility vehicle models under the WAEV and Taylor-Dunn brands. While the GEM el XD model, which is similar to vehicles in the AYRO 411x Fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the AYRO 411x, the GEM el XD requires reconfiguration to match the standard AYRO 411x features, raising the final MSRP of each vehicle above that of the AYRO 411x Fleet alternative. The AYRO 411x Fleet has a greater bed and box capacity, 13% more horsepower and a 48% better turning radius, allowing use of the 411x Fleet in tighter spaces than are possible using the GEM el XD.
 
We expect competition in our industry to intensify over time. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our vehicles or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
 
Target Markets
 
The multipurpose applications and clean energy use of LSEVs make them popular across a wide array of industries and customers, including college and university campuses, resorts and hotels, corporate parks, hospitals, warehouses, individual consumers, last mile delivery service providers, municipalities, and the food service industry. A number of these market segments, and our competitive position within them, are discussed in greater detail below.
 
Universities. LSEVs are growing increasingly common on university and college campuses due to a number of factors. LSEVs fulfil the versatile needs of campuses better than golf carts or standard combustion vehicles because not only do LSEVs’ low speed thresholds promote safer driving among pedestrians, but the vehicles are also street legal with on-road safety features, enabling drivers to drive on roads and free up pedestrian space along sidewalks and smaller pathways. Additionally, the significantly reduced carbon imprint of LSEVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles appeals to environmentally aware students and professors looking to promote environmental sustainability on campus. By transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to LSEVs, campuses should be able to reduce significantly the costs spent on fuel, oil, parts, and maintenance. Our AYRO 411x Fleet provides all of these benefits to university and college campuses. We estimate that in the U.S., there are over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 10,000 students each with over 400 on-campus vehicles that are ideal targets for the AYRO 411x Fleet as campuses transition from fossil-fueled campus fleet vehicles to LSEVs.
 
Food Delivery Services. As the millennial generation assumes a more substantial portion of the consumer population, customers increasingly favor convenience and timeliness, spurring dramatic growth in online ordering and delivery services across a wide swath of industries, including food delivery and restaurant ordering services. Food delivery sales are anticipated to increase over 20% per year, culminating in an expected $365 billion worldwide by 2030, according to Upserve. Upserve further estimates that approximately 60% of U.S. consumers report that they order delivery or takeout at least once a week. Within the next decade, potentially over 40% of restaurant sales will be attributable to delivery services, according to Morgan Stanley. Every major urban environment having a 35mph or less speed limit is a target market for our current and future LSV fleet.

Last Mile Delivery Service. Retail focus on last mile delivery—the movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination—has grown exponentially over the past few years due to the rise in online ordering and e-commerce. Consumers’ ability to pick and choose products based on delivery speed and availability makes last mile delivery a key differentiator among retailers. Last mile delivery provides retailers timelier and more convenient delivery options not offered by the main three shipping services in the U.S. (the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS). Additionally, given the increasing designation of low emission zones in urban centers, retailers will need to continue to deploy eco-friendly vehicles. Retailers will likely expand the use of LSEV fleets to make deliveries in low emission zones due to their zero gas emissions and lower price than competing electric vehicles. We expect that the AYRO 411x Fleet, with a plurality of cargo bed options, is well positioned for hauling and delivery in those environments and should distinguish itself amongst the competition.
 
Municipalities. As more city governments adopt regulations geared toward reducing pollution from vehicles, cities are increasingly looking to replace their municipal vehicles with zero-emission fleets. Such fleet overhauls, however, can be costly. LSEVs are a cheaper and more practical option for cities daunted by the cost of standard electronic vehicles. Our LSEVs have both on and off-road capabilities, making them particularly versatile for municipalities.
 
On-Road and Personal Transportation. LSEVs offer a feasible and practical method of transportation, especially in urban centers. Because our LSEVs are street legal, they offer city dwellers a more sustainable, cost-efficient, easily maneuverable, compact and light weight option compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. Our LSEVs also offer a variety of specifications and equipment, meaning that consumers do not have to sacrifice comfort or convenience.
 
We primarily focus on the LSEV North American market, which is highly competitive and constitutes 28% of the global LSEV market according to WiseGuy Reports. We have examined various considerations with regard to our market impact, including cost comparisons to existing vehicles in the market, market validation and target commercial markets.
 
Business Developments
 
On September 25, 2020, we entered into the Karma Agreement with Karma. The term of the contract was 12 months from the start of volume production of the vehicles (which began in June 2021). Pursuant to the agreement, Karma provides manufacturing services, starting in 2021, under a statement of work including final assembly, raw material storage and logistical support of AYRO’s vehicles in return for compensation of $1.2 million. We paid Karma $0.52 million, which was recorded as prepaid expense as of December 31, 2020, and $0.68 million, of which $0.47 million was recorded as an expense due to fewer projected 411x units expected to be assembled in Karma in 2022. This second payment completes our Karma contract compensation. Additionally, we made a cash payment of $0.08 million and issued warrants to an advisor to the transaction at signing of the contract with a fair value of $0.07 million.
Resources
 
We source our semi-knocked-down kits for the model year 2022 AYRO 411 and 411x from Cenntro. While many of their components are commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) parts, many are specific to the 411 product and are subject to raw material limitations. However, in preparation for the model year 2023 platform, we are endeavoring to reduce supply risk by migrating our vehicle supply chain to the North American continent and by embracing parts and sub-assembly standardization, reducing discrete stock keeping units and simplifying the logistical complexity.

Intellectual Property
 
As we expand our vehicle & service roadmaps, and integrated technologies, our focus on identifying specific market and customer needs continues to drive purpose-built engineering efforts.
 
Leveraging the all-electric AYRO 411x Fleet LSVs, we develop applications or use case solutions optimized for the storage, delivery and logistics for delivering food, beverages, merchandise, equipment, tools and related goods. This is accomplished by integrating application-specific appliances, storage facilities, vehicle wraps and brands and related items. We leverage either integrated traction or a separate battery power system to provide AC power to the various appliances and solution elements. We are filing and have filed a number of provisional utility and/or design patents associated with the aforementioned verticalization development, and we have filed for both in the United States and internationally trademarks to cover the company name, company logo, and certain other key product and service marks. We continue to focus on innovative and applicable electric vehicle optimization designs that serve an expanding customer and application use base.
Patents
 
We currently have United States registrations for two design patents. Both were issued on February 11, 2020 and will expire on February 11, 2035. In addition to these issued patents, we have numerous non-public patent applications on file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
 
We filed United States registrations for three provisional patents in February 2021. Unless the patents are perfected within a twelve-month period from their filing date, they will expire. As of December 31, 2021 the Company has no plans to perfect these patents before expiration.
 
We have filed the first “generation 2” design patent filed with the USPTO on March 10, 2022. Follow-on non-design patents are in work, with an expectation to have patents representing defensive merit under USPTO evaluation by late summer 2022.
 
Trademarks
 
We have numerous granted and pending trademark applications in the United States and abroad. We registered the word “AYRO” as United States Registration No. 88431321 on June 23, 2020. This registration was also filed in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union under the Madrid Protocol as Registration No. 1507096. Our Company logo was registered as United States Registration No. 88859276 on October 13, 2020. This logo was also registered in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union under the Madrid Protocol as Registration No. 1554092. Our application for the color version of our Company logo was filed in the United States on October 9, 2020 as Serial No. 90245135 and is currently in prosecution with the USPTO.
 
Both our Company logo and our company tagline have evolved to better represent a vehicle marque and the science underlying sustainability. Accordingly, our registered filings will be updated in the first half of 2022.
 
Government Regulations
 
Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting AYRO are discussed below.

13
--

Mobile Source Emissions Control
 
The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States. The current (“Tier 2”) emissions regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, set standards for motorcycles. Tier 2 emissions standards also establish durability requirements for emissions components to 5 years or 30,000 kilometers.
 
California has received a waiver from the EPA to establish its own unique emissions control standards for certain regulated pollutants. New vehicles and engines sold in California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). CARB’s emissions standards for motorcycles are in line with those of the EPA. We currently expect that our vehicles will meet and exceed both the EPA’s and CARB’s standards.
 
Motor Vehicle Safety
 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or “Safety Act,” regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. If we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Certification
 
Our product programs are built on plug-in electric, zero emissions platforms. We report federal and state emissions data consistent with 10 CFR 474 and CARB requirements for Zero-Emission Vehicle certification.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
 
The Federal Communications Commission is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the communications law and regulations, including title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically Part 15, which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. With very few exceptions, all electronics devices must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before they can be advertised or sold in the U.S. market.
Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
As with helmet laws and driver license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork, nationwide. Our agreement with Club Car aims to provide U.S. and targeted countries channel and dealer coverage. For our electric vehicles, outside of our collaboration with Club Car or another third-party sales/distribution white label partner, we plan on a multi-faceted approach to sales, including exploring the following: (i) developing an expanded network of channel partners; (ii) entering into direct sales via a national leasing company that will in turn consummate sales with end users in a variety of states; and/or (iii) opening facilities in high growth states and delivering the vehicle to the end user via a common carrier. During the course of 2022, the Company expects to complete work on a Model Year 2023 refresh vehicle. That vehicle will share no commonality with the legacy 411 platform, and will be the product of a supply chain evolution from the far east to North America. We expect to continue offering this vehicle to the marketplace through our Club Car relationship, but may explore alternate channel partners for market segments that Club Car does not serve, including direct sales to select Governmental entities.
 
We are registered as a manufacturer in Texas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Arizona.
 
Pollution Control Costs
 
We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.
Research and Development
 
Our product development and engineering efforts align with the Society of Automotive Engineering (“SAE”) J2258_201611 standards for Light Utility Vehicles. The J2258 standard provides key compliance criteria for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (“GVWR”), occupant protection and safety restraint systems, lateral and longitudinal stability, center of gravity and operating controls, among others. Our test validation and inspection standards follow Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) 49 CFR 571.500 for LSVs with the additions of SAE J585 and FMVSS 111 for rear visibility, lighting, signaling, reflectors, changes in direction of movement, back-up camera response timing and field of view.
 
Our development standards and test compliance validation processes are supported by a variety of test documentation, including supplier self-reporting, third party laboratory test reports and regional compliance validation with CARB for speed, range and environmental performance.

Our production system follows a lean, cell-based manufacturing model. The process involves the following five sequential cells: (1) cab preparation, (2) chassis preparation, (3) system integration and testing, (4) final assembly and integration test, and (5) quality assurance and FMVSS Compliance. Assembly quality and shift efficiency metrics are measured daily by our production staff at end of every shift.
 
We maintain a certification and compliance check list for each vehicle. Our vehicles use an automotive style steering wheel, turn signal stalk, headlight, running light and reverse light controls, a multi-speed windshield wiper and washer and an accelerator and brake pedal consistent with controls employed in standard passenger cars. As the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles are direct drive vehicles, there is no stick shift, clutch, paddle shift, or belt driven CSV (continuously variable) transmission needed to operate the vehicles within the intended torque band and speed range. Accordingly, our vehicles are homologated under existing U.S., state and local LSV requirements under 49 CFR 571.3.
 
Segment Information
 
We operate as one reportable segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 32 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we maintain good relations with our employees. We have not furloughed employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to attract and retain quality employees, we offer industry-standard compensation and benefits packages to our employees and prospective employees.
Geographic Areas
 
We operate in the United States, and all our revenue was generated in the United States during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. All of our assets are held in United States.
Corporate History
 
Merger
 
On May 28, 2020, pursuant to the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Merger Sub, and AYRO Operating, Merger Sub was merged with and into AYRO Operating, with AYRO Operating continuing after the merger as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the effective time of the Merger, without any action on the part of any stockholder, each issued and outstanding share of AYRO Operating’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “AYRO Operating Common Stock”), including shares underlying AYRO Operating’s outstanding equity awards and warrants, was converted into the right to receive 1.3634 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”). Immediately following the effective time of the Merger, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and immediately following the Reverse Stock Split, the Company issued a stock dividend of one share of Company Common Stock for each outstanding share of AYRO Operating Common Stock to all holders of record immediately following the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the “Stock Dividend”). The net result of the Reverse Stock Split and the Stock Dividend was a 1-for-5 reverse stock split. Upon completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement and assuming the exercise in full of all pre-funded warrants issued pursuant thereto, (i) the former AYRO Operating equity holders (including the investors in a bridge financing and in private placements that closed prior to closing of the Merger) owned approximately 79% of the outstanding equity of the Company; (ii) former DropCar stockholders owned approximately 18% of the outstanding equity of the Company; and (iii) a financial advisor to DropCar and AYRO owned approximately 3% of the outstanding equity of the Company.

The Merger was treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes because substantially all of DropCar, Inc.’s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the Merger and therefore no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by the Company as a result of the Merger. AYRO Operating was treated as the accounting acquirer, as its stockholders controlled the Company after the Merger, even though DropCar, Inc. was the legal acquirer. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements are those of AYRO Operating as if AYRO Operating had always been the reporting company. All references to AYRO Operating, Inc. shares of common stock, warrants and options have been presented on a post-merger, post-reverse split basis.
 
Closing of Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On December 19, 2019, DropCar entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with DC Partners Acquisition, LLC (“DC Partners”), Spencer Richardson and David Newman, pursuant to which DropCar agreed to sell substantially all of the assets associated with its business of providing vehicle support, fleet logistics and concierge services for both consumers and the automotive industry to an entity controlled by Messrs. Richardson and Newman, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Business Development Officer at the time, respectively. The aggregate purchase price for the purchased assets consisted of the cancellation of certain liabilities pursuant to those certain employment agreements by and between DropCar and each of Messrs. Richardson and Newman, plus the assumption of certain liabilities relating to, or arising out of, workers’ compensation claims that occurred prior to the closing date of the Asset Purchase Agreement. On May 28, 2020, the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment”), which Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment (i) provided for the inclusion of up to $0.03 million in refunds associated with certain insurance premiums as assets being purchased by DC Partners, (ii) amended the covenant associated with the funding of the DropCar business, such that DropCar provided the DropCar business with additional funding of approximately $0.18 million at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and (iii) provided for a current employee of the Company being transferred to DC Partners to provide transition services to the Company for a period of three months after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on May 28, 2020, immediately following the consummation of the Merger.
