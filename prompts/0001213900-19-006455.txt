ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
NanoFlex Power Corporation, formerly known as Universal Technology Systems, Corp., was incorporated in the State of Florida on January 28, 2013. On September 24, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Global Photonic Energy Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (“GPEC”) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). Immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange Transaction and as a result, the Company owned 100% of the equity interests of GPEC and GPEC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On November 25, 2013, the Company changed its name from “Universal Technology Systems, Corp.” to “NanoFlex Power Corporation” and its trading symbol was changed to “OPVS” on December 26, 2013.
 
GPEC was incorporated in Pennsylvania on February 7, 1994. The Company is organized to fund, develop, commercialize and license advanced photovoltaic technologies that enable thin film solar products with what we believe to be industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost.
 
These technologies are targeted at certain broad applications, including: (a) portable and off-grid power generation, (b) building applied photovoltaics (“BAPV”), (c) building integrated photovoltaics (“BIPV”), (d) space vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), (e) semi-transparent solar power generating windows or glazing, (f) ultra-thin solar films for automobiles or other consumer applications and (g) solar powered sensors.
 
We believe these technologies have been demonstrated in a laboratory environment with our research partners. The Company is currently taking steps to pursue product development and commercialization on some of these technologies in collaboration with industry partners and potential customers.
 
Our Business
 
The Company’s business model has shifted to developing its own complete products utilizing its intellectual property portfolio to provide sustainable competitive advantage in the market place. NanoFlex’s product direction is aimed at providing competitively superior energy harvesting to power many types of consumer industrial devices. NanoFlex will also consider partnering, licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies to large, well-positioned commercial partners which can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, from which the Company expects to receive license royalties. Additionally, these manufacturing partners can also serve as a source of III-V solar cell supply for the Company to provide products to customers on its own through a “fab-less” manufacturing model, particularly in the early stages of market development.
 
The Company is developing its own products and working with industry partners to commercialize its technologies for key applications where it believes they present compelling competitive advantage. For example, the Company has established an engineering team comprised of five full-time engineers to support the transfer and implementation of technologies from university laboratories to NanoFlex products and industry partners’ commercial product designs and fabrication processes. To this end, on August 26, 2015, the Company signed a Joint Development Agreement with SolAero Technologies Corp. (“SolAero”), which provides for the joint development of high efficiency solar cells utilizing the Company’s proprietary manufacturing processes in conjunction with SolAero’s advanced high efficiency solar cell technologies. In May 2017, SolAero was awarded an approximately $6.3 million contract with the Army Research Laboratory (Mantech) to design flexible folding solar panels that fold and fit in soldier back packs and charge the 25 pounds of batteries typically carried by a soldier into battle. These solar panels utilize III-V solar technology with NanoFlex process cost reduction intellectual property and will generate approximately 310 watts under one sun and will weigh approximately three pounds. The Company is a subcontractor to SolAero, and our portion of the contract is approximately $3.3 million of which $1.6 million is subcontracted to the University of Michigan over a four-year period. On February 1, 2019 we were informed by SolAero that Mantech had terminated the contract as provided for in the agreement. The Company will be fully reimbursed for all costs incurred through that date. The Company is attempting to ascertain the reason for the cancellation.

As reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017, on February 2, 2017, the Company entered into a License Agreement with SolAero pursuant to which, the Company agreed to grant SolAero a non-exclusive worldwide license to use, sell, offer for sale, import or otherwise dispose of certain products (the “Licensed Products”) using the Company’s patented proprietary manufacturing processes relating to Gallium Arsenide-based photovoltaic cells (the “Licensed Patents’) within the space and near-space fields of use (the “Licensed Field”). SolAero is to pay the Company a royalty based on sales of the Licensed Products within the Licensed Field. The agreement does not provide SolAero with the right to sublicense the Licensed Patents. The term of the agreement runs from February 2, 2017, through the expiration date of the last expiring patent included in the Licensed Technology. However, each party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party.
 
By establishing our own engineering team, we have become less reliant on our university partners. As a result, we have suspended our sponsored research agreement with the University of Southern California which covered our OPV technologies. In addition, on August 31, 2017, we suspended our research agreements with the University of Michigan and established a time and materials contract to access its LNF lab as needed to continue to commercialize our technologies. The University of Michigan research team is a subcontractor to NanoFlex in connection with the ARL Mantech contract.
 
The Company is continuing to seek additional partners for its GaAs-based processes and technologies and our engineering team is focused on further development of these processes and technologies and their use in NanoFlex manufactured and marketed products.
 
The Company is in the development stage as it has not yet commercialized any products or received any royalties licensing its intellectual property. It is the opinion of the Company’s auditors’ that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern based on its need to continue raising capital to support its activities.
 
Sponsored Research and License Agreements
 
Research and development of the Company’s high efficiency solar thin films and OPV technologies have been conducted in collaboration with University partners through sponsored research agreements. 
 
The Company established direct research and development agreements with the University of Michigan (“Michigan”) on June 16, 2016, which were amended on July 21, 2016, to provide engineering support and facility access associated with technology transfer and commercialization of its high efficiency thin film solar technologies. The Company suspended these research agreements with Michigan on August 31, 2017 and established a time and materials contract to access Michigan’s LNF lab as needed. The Company also subcontracted with Michigan to support the ARL Mantech contract.
 
A separate research agreement dated December 20, 2013, among the Company and the University of Southern California (“USC”) (the “2013 Research Agreement”), governs research conducted by USC and Michigan on high efficiency thin film and OPV technologies. Michigan is a subcontractor to USC on this research agreement. The 2013 Research Agreement expires on January 31, 2021.
 
On August 8, 2016, the Company amended the 2013 Research Agreement with USC, suspending the agreement effective as of August 15, 2016. The Company requested this amendment to temporarily suspend its OPV-related sponsored research activities to reduce near-term expenditures while it seeks a development partner for OPV commercialization and to allow the Company to bring its account with USC current through a payment plan. The suspension is to continue until the date that is 30 days after expenses incurred by USC have been reimbursed by the Company. Under this amendment, the Company was required to repay expenses to USC in quarterly installments through February 2018, unless earlier repaid at the Company’s option. The amended agreement provides USC with the option to terminate the agreement upon any late installment payments. The final installment was paid in January 2018.

Under the Company’s currently effective License Agreement, as amended on August 22, 2016, among the Company and USC, Michigan, and Princeton University (“Princeton”) (the “Fourth Amendment to License Agreement”), wherein the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the Company’s sponsored research agreements, the Company agreed to pay for all reasonable and necessary out of pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of patent applications designated by the Company. In addition, the Company is required to pay to the Universities 3% of net sales of licensed products or licensed processes used, leased or sold by the Company, 3% of revenues received by the Company from the sublicensing of patent rights and 23% of revenues (net of costs and expenses, including legal fees) received by the Company from final judgments in infringement actions respecting the patent rights licensed under the agreement. A previous amendment to the License Agreement (the Third Amendment to License Agreement dated December 20, 2013) amended the minimum royalty section to eliminate the accrual of any such royalties until 2014. Furthermore, the amounts of the non-refundable minimum royalties, which would be applicable starting in 2014, were adjusted to be lower than the amounts in the previous License Agreement. Minimum royalties are $100,000 per year for the remainder of the contract. 
 
There is currently no ongoing research activity at USC, Michigan and Princeton related to the Company, although the Company maintains licensing rights to technology previously developed by the universities.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development costs pertaining to our sponsored research efforts and our establishment of our internal engineering team of $936,789 and $708,840, respectively.

Philosophy and Approach
 
The Company is currently focusing its efforts on its architectures, manufacturing processes, and technologies to provide manufacturers of compound semiconductor solar cells with the capability of producing ultra-high efficiency GaAs solar cells in thin-film form factors at a substantially reduced cost that is competitive with existing thin-film solar technologies. We believe this has the potential to open new market segments such as portable field generation, mobile power, BAPV, BIPV and aerospace which are not well-served by crystalline silicon solar technologies. The Company is also seeking partners to commercialize its OPV thin film solar technologies which aim to provide highly flexible solar energy solutions for new applications such as BIPV (semi-transparent solar films for glass) and ultra-thin films for coatings on automobiles, other applications that demand design flexibility and light weight and solar powered IoT sensors. Additionally, we believe OPV technologies have the potential to achieve a very low-cost structure relative to other solar technologies due to minimal material usage and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing.
 
The Company plans to license or sublicense its intellectual property to industry partners and customers. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, but also serve as a source of solar cell supply for the Company to provide products to customers on its own, particularly in the early stages of market development. This business model is oriented around licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies to large, well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. This model is also intended to quickly establish the Company as an important player in the solar industry with rapid, high-margin revenue growth. Potential partners for our high efficiency technologies include current manufacturers of compound semiconductor solar cells, who recognize the potential for our technology to dramatically reduce production costs, improve their margins, and open new market opportunities. Potential partners for our OPV technologies include manufacturers of electronics, including organic electronics, existing developers of OPV solar technologies, producers of advanced materials and films, manufacturers of building materials, and glass manufacturers. 
 
In addition, the Company believes that there are several avenues for early revenue generation that become possible with the establishment of its developmental engineering team. First among these avenues is government funding. The Department of Energy (“DOE”), Department of Defense (“DoD”), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) all have interests in technologies that can deliver lightweight, high-efficiency solar power that contribute toward ubiquitous solar.
 
The Company also anticipates that advancements achieved by its engineering team can attract other industry partners to acquire early licenses to use its intellectual property. Finally, new licenses and agreements can be made possible by ongoing technology development, especially that relating to perfecting and broadening of the Company’s intellectual property in ultra-thin-film semi-transparent organic solar cells.

High Efficiency Thin Film Solar Technologies
 
The Company’s first technology platform is focused on improving the manufacturing process and device architecture of solar cells based on III-V compound semiconductors, including GaAs, and is currently advancing toward commercialization. GaAs is a key component of many ultrahigh-performance electronic technologies used in cellular telephones and military applications. The very highest single-junction and multi-junction solar cell efficiencies (approximately 29% and 44%, respectively, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”)) are based on GaAs. However, they are prohibitively expensive for mass markets and hence are only considered for specialty applications where performance and weight requirements outweigh cost considerations, such as space-borne applications. Broader market acceptance of ultra-high efficiency compound semiconductor solar technologies requires substantial cost reductions.
 
The Company’s patented technology has the potential to enable these cost reductions by: (1) reducing the cost of the solar cell by re-using expensive GaAs source material and (2) using mini-concentrators to decrease the size of the active solar cell used within a solar module. Furthermore, the Company’s technology combines the high-power conversion efficiency of compound semiconductor solar cells with an extremely light weight and flexible form factor that meets requirements for applications that are not well-served by crystalline silicon technologies, due to heavy weight and rigidity, or by other thin films due to low power conversion efficiency.
 
The primary cost in fabricating GaAs-based solar cells is the very high cost of the GaAs substrates on which the thin active region (called the epitaxial layers) is grown. These substrates, or “parent wafers,” constitute the largest portion of the total cost of a GaAs-based solar cell. During the fabrication process currently used in industry, these expensive parent wafers are destroyed when the solar cell layer is removed, yielding only a single solar thin film for each expensive parent wafer. Existing GaAs solar cell fabricators continue to seek methods to prevent damage to the parent wafer to enable multiple re-growths thereby fabricating multiple solar thin films from a single parent wafer. The Company, through its researchers, has developed an architecture and process enabling the active solar cell layer (approximately 1/1,000th of the thickness of a human hair) to be removed from the parent wafer on which it is grown in a non-destructive manner without degradation in surface area, thereby allowing for the re-use of the wafer multiple times. Further, lab tests also reflect no degradation in solar cell performance from each growth and removal cycle.
 
We believe this patented ND-ELO process revolutionizes the cost structure of GaAs-based compound semiconductor solar cell technology, allocating the high cost of the parent wafer to multiple solar thin films, substantially reducing the total cost per watt for each solar cell. Further, as part of the ND-ELO process, the ultra-thin photovoltaic layer is bonded to a flexible and thin secondary substrate such as plastic or metal foil using our adhesive-free, lightweight, ultra-strong and flexible process called cold-weld bonding. The cold-weld bonding process enables highly flexible and lightweight thin film solar cells.
 
A second aspect of the Company’s high efficiency thin film solar technology centers on minimizing the required size of the high-efficiency solar cell through the use of mini-concentrators, thereby further reducing cost. In this design, narrow strips or small area thin-film cells are placed at the trough of low-profile plastic parabolic concentrators. The concentrators harvest solar energy using a wide acceptance angle and focus it into the small solar cell. This enables solar energy harvesting throughout the day and the integrated device is able to capture approximately the equivalent energy production density (measured in kW-hrs/m2) as a full-sized solar cell at a substantially reduced cost.
 
With the combination of the high conversion efficiencies of compound semiconductor solar cells and the cost reductions associated with implementing our proprietary ND-ELO processes and mini-concentration technologies, we believe the costs of ultra-high efficiency GaAs-based solar cells can approach cost-per-Watt metrics associated with competing solar technologies, particularly thin films such as CIGS, while providing substantial performance advantages associated with power per surface area and power per weight.

Organic Photovoltaic Technologies
 
The Company’s second technology platform is based on flexible, thin-film OPV technologies that have been researched and developed over the last two decades by our sponsored research partners. Relative to other solar technologies, we believe OPV presents compelling advantages relating to form factor flexibility and aesthetics and has the potential to realize extremely low production costs.
 
Because the organic films are lightweight and extremely thin (in this case the entire structure is approximately 1/10,000th of the thickness of a human hair), they can be made semitransparent and adjusted to any desirable color. As a result, we believe there are significant opportunities to achieve heretofore unrealizable applications such as window glazing and ultra-thin films or coatings to be incorporated into non-conformal or non-planar surfaces. 
 
OPV technologies have potential to achieve a very low-cost structure, derived from low materials cost and highly efficient roll-to-roll processing. The ultra-thin layer of OPV requires small quantities of materials. Furthermore, layers of OPV material can be deposited directly onto plastic or metal foils and there is no need for energy-intensive fabrication processes required by other solar technologies, such as silicon. Rather, there is the opportunity to “print” organic solar cells onto continuous rolls of plastic in high-speed and low energy intensity manufacturing process. We believe the potential for printed electronics - making solar films roll-to-roll rather than by batch processing - makes OPV a potentially revolutionary step in the widespread acceptance and deployment of solar energy.
 
The Company’s approach has been to advance all dimensions of OPV technology, including the invention and development of new materials, new high efficiency device architectures, and high-speed, low-energy-intensity production processes such as organic vapor phase deposition and solar cell modulization.
 
OPV’s form factor flexibility offers the potential for solutions in various tints and transparencies, offering unique solutions well-suited for BIPV applications, including facades, curtain walls, skylights, and windows. Our discussions with architects emphasize a need for BIPV solutions offering design flexibility and high-quality aesthetics. Furthermore, OPV also offers the potential for very low costs due to its low material usage and suitability for roll-to-roll processing.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company is engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of advanced photovoltaic technologies that enable thin film solar products with what we believe can be industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost. Our sponsored research programs at the University of Southern California (“USC”), the University of Michigan (“Michigan”), and Princeton University (“Princeton”) have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending patents worldwide covering flexible, thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Pursuant to our license agreement with our university research partners, we have obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property which resulted from sponsored research programs with the universities. While each patent is issued in the name of the respective university that developed the subject technology, the Company has exclusive commercial license rights to all of the patents and their attendant technologies, and the patents are referred to herein as being the Company’s patents.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 81 issued patents and 41 pending non-provisional applications, and one pending provisional application. In addition, in countries and regions outside the U.S., including, but not limited to, China, European Patent Convention, India, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, there were a total of approximately 50 issued patents and 128 pending patent applications. These numbers exclude issued and pending patents that the Company has identified for abandonment to optimize its patent portfolio and reduce unnecessary or redundant costs while still protecting critical technologies. The duration of the issued U.S. and foreign patents is typically 20 years from their respective first effective filing dates. In addition to our issued patents set forth above, we have numerous patent applications in process. While each patent is issued in the name of the respective university that developed the subject technology, the Company has exclusive commercial license rights to all of the patents and their attendant technologies, and the patents are referred to herein as being the Company’s patents.
 
These patented and patent-pending technologies fall into two general categories – (1) cost reducing and performance-enhancing fabrication processes and device architectures for ultra-high efficiency Gallium Arsenide (“GaAs”)-based solar thin films and (2) organic photovoltaic (“OPV”) materials, architectures, and fabrication processes for low cost, ultra-thin solar films offering high quality aesthetics, such as semi-transparency and tinting, and highly flexible form factors. The technologies are targeted at certain broad applications that require high power conversion efficiency, flexibility, and light weight. These potential applications include: (a) mobile and off-grid solar power generation, (b) BAPV, (c) BIPV, (d) space vehicles and UAVs, (e) semi-transparent solar power generating glazing on windows, (f) ultra-thin solar films for automobiles or other consumer and industrial applications and (g) solar powered sensors.

The patent applications currently being filed are part of a dynamic, comprehensive development strategy to protect our commercialization rights. Following this developmental strategy, current work builds on earlier work, with new discoveries continually developed and protected. Additionally, as we progress with product development and commercialization, we also have focused on optimizing the patent portfolio, reducing unnecessary or redundant costs while still protecting critical technologies.
 
Exemplary U.S. patents related to our high efficiency thin film solar technologies include U.S. Patent Nos. 8,378,385, 8,927,319, 9,118,026, 9,548,218, 9,461,193, 9,412,960, 10,069,033, 10,074,820 and 10,141,465 which will expire on September 9, 2030, October 23, 2030, September 14, 2031, February 7, 2033, August 7, 2033, December 16, 2033, January 15, 2035, June 26, 2034, and April 6, 2035, respectively. In addition to these issued patents, we are pursuing additional protection for our high efficiency thin film portfolio in over 15 pending U.S. patent applications, and 1 pending PCT application, which will be filed in the U.S. before its due date. If U.S. patents are successfully issued with respect to these pending applications, we expect that the earliest expiration date for the patents will be no earlier than June 2032.
 
Exemplary U.S. patents related to our OPV-related technologies include U.S. Patent Nos. 9,666,816, 9,391,284, 9,515,275, 8,912,036, 8,158,972, 9,768,402, 8,785,624, 9,447,107, 8,816,332, 9,130,170 9,847,487, 10,069,095, and 10,141,531, which will expire on August 22, 2028, August 28, 2028, October 26, 2029, March 19, 2030, March 24, 2030, April 6, 2031, June 27, 2031, September 9, 2031, February 21, 2032, November 1, 2032, November 22, 2033, March 14, 2034, and November 27, 2033, respectively.  In addition to these issued patents, we are pursuing additional protection for our OPV-related portfolio in over 20 pending U.S. patent applications.
 
Some of our technology holdings include foundational concepts in the following areas:
 
High Efficiency Thin Film Solar Technologies:
 

● | Accelerated and recyclable liftoff process. Our research partners have invented and patented manufacturing processes and materials that allow current manufacturers of high efficiency solar cells to reduce their existing fabrication costs, because the process preserves the integrity of the parent substrate which can be re-used without chemo-mechanical polishing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cold-weld bonding of inorganic solar cells to plastic substrates and metal foils. This cold-weld bonding process enables the direct bonding of active solar material to a thin plastic or metal substrate without using adhesive. This creates thin-film cells that are lighter weight and highly flexible. 
● | Low cost plastic mini-compound parabolic concentrator arrays. This allows a fraction of the GaAs solar cell material while collecting an equivalent amount of energy over the course of a sun arc. 
● | Integrated tracking technology. Lattice-like solar cells, with a design inspired by Kirigami, that can stretch like an accordion, allowing them to tilt along the sun’s trajectory and capture up to an estimated 36% more energy than flat cells. 
● | Micro-inverters monolithically integrated into high efficiency solar cells during production. Integrating micro-inverters into the solar cell has the potential to greatly reduce the total cost of a photovoltaic system.

Organic Photovoltaics:
 

● | Multi-junction organic solar cell. Individual conventional solar cells have limited spectral coverage, voltage output, and tradeoff between absorption length and charge collection length. By stacking multiple solar cells with complementary absorption profiles, voltages of the cells can be added (at a constant current). This can make a more efficient cell. The researchers at Michigan have achieved 12.6% power conversion efficiency in the lab. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fullerene acceptors. Fullerenes include molecules such as C 60 , C 70 , C 84 and derivatives that are designed to dissolve in solvents and are the most prevalent acceptor in organic photovoltaics. Fullerenes offer better efficiency than any other acceptor molecule implemented to date. 
● | Blocking layers. In most solar cell designs, excitons must be blocked and reflected away from the metallic (or transparent) contact so that they can be dissociated at the donor-acceptor junction. Additionally, it is desired that these layers block the wrong carrier from contacting the electrode. 
● | New materials for visible and infrared sensitivity. Current OPV materials absorb light in the visible and deep red part of the solar spectrum, but do not collect light in the near infrared (“NIR”). Extending efficient light collection into the NIR has the potential to increase photocurrent generation by 40%, markedly improving OPV performance. 
● | Scalable growth technologies. A number of growth technologies have been developed for organic materials. These include vacuum thermal evaporation and organic vapor phase deposition for materials that can be sublimed or evaporated directly and gravure or ink-jet printing of dissolved materials. All of these processes are compatible with rigid planar substrates, but more importantly can also be applied to flexible plastic or metal foil substrates, for roll-to-roll fabrication of OPVs.


● | Inverted solar cells. One of the most air sensitive parts of the OPV is the region between the anode and electron acceptor. This region is degraded by oxygen and water in the dark and even more so under illumination. This interfacial region in a “conventional” OPV is exposed to the atmosphere directly, requiring that the OPV be kept in a hermetic package. If the OPV is prepared as an inverted cell, the air sensitive anode/organic interfacial region is placed below the donor, buffer layer and cathode. Thus, the device itself provides a level of “packaging,” markedly slowing environmental degradation of the device, minimizing packaging requirements for long term deployment in the field. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Materials for enhanced light collection via multi-exciton generation. An approach for improving the power conversion efficiency by collecting the high energy part of the spectrum, i.e. UV-to-green, and double the energy collected from this part of the solar spectrum using singlet fission (“SF”). SF materials absorb high energy light and generate two excitons for every photon absorbed, thus doubling the light collection efficiency. The SF approach has the potential to give a single solar cell efficiency well over the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit, without increasing the cost to produce the cell. 
● | Mixed layer and nanocrystalline cells. In planar (e.g., bilayer) cells, the thickness of a layer is limited by the distance an exciton is expected to travel before it recombines. If the layer is too thick, photons absorbed may never result in collected charge. If the layers are too thin, there is insufficient material available for absorption of the light. By mixing the donor and acceptor throughout a thicker layer, an additional donor-acceptor interface is created throughout the layer, improving photocurrent generation capability. Nanocrystalline cells have a higher degree of phase separation between the donor and acceptor with nanocrystalline domains, with high purity and domain sizes in the nanometer scale.
● | Solar films and coatings. OPV technology enables materials to be deposited onto virtually any smooth substrate (can be curved or non-planar). The idea is to create solar coatings or films that can be applied quickly and easily to any surface, including, for example, mobile communications devices, electric cars, roofing materials, building siding and glass. 
● | Transparent/semi-transparent cells. In certain applications it may be desirable to have a partially transparent solar cell. These applications include tinted windows. Instead of just absorbing or reflecting the light, the light would be absorbed and converted into energy. The unique nature of organics allows the Company to tune the wavelengths absorbed to those that it does not want transmitted or that are not useful for vision, such as in the infrared region of the spectrum.

Development Goals
 
The Company plans to accelerate the commercialization of its high efficiency technology (as set forth below) but there can be no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary capital to fund such plans. Our research and development efforts are now focused primarily on developing energy harvesting products which capitalize on our high-performance thin film photovoltaic intellectual property. In addition, we will engage in collaborative research and development with industry partners, including existing compound semiconductor solar cell manufacturers. Our engineering team is in position to develop NanoFlex products as well as support the transfer of technologies from university laboratories to implementation in industry partners’ commercial product designs and fabrication processes.
 
Our engineering team is now focused on developing new NanoFlex products as well as working closely with potential customers such as military users for mobile field applications, and system integrators, installers, and architects for BAPV and BIPV applications. This customer interaction allows the Company to better understand application specific requirements and incorporate these requirements into our product development cycle. Our primary technical objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of our high efficiency solar thin film technologies in NanoFlex products. We plan to demonstrate ND-ELO technology on GaAs wafers of increasing diameter and on compound semiconductor solar cells of increasing complexity. The Company plans to produce prototypes for demonstrations, test, and evaluation. Once competitive advantage is demonstrated in an application the Company plans to scale its product production for its own sales and marketing plans.
 
The Company aims to achieve greater than 15% power conversion efficiencies on organic solar cells with operational lifetimes of 20 years on barrier-coated plastic or metal foil substrates, and to demonstrate roll-to-roll “printing” of solar cells on plastic or metal foil substrates of increasing width.
 
Overall Operating Plan
 
Our business model is now shifting to focus on the production of NanoFlex products which have a competitive advantage using our intellectual property. We expect to work with well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. These manufacturing partners can also serve as a source of solar cell supply for NanoFlex to provide products to customers on its own as well as through a “fab-less” manufacturing model.
 
To support this work, our III-V solar engineering team leverages the facilities and equipment at the University of Michigan on a commercial contract basis, which we believe is a cost-effective approach to move the technologies toward commercialization. We believe that this allows our engineering team to develop our flexible solar panel products as well as without the need for large-scale capital investment in clean room facilities and solar cell fabrication equipment. 
 
We are also pursuing sponsored development funding to generate revenue in the near-term as well as subsidize our product development with non-dilutive financing. In connection with our focus on potential government-sponsored research projects, on June 19, 2017, the Company announced that that it is part of a consortium that was awarded a $6.3 million contract from the Army Research Laboratory’s Army Research Office to develop high power, flexible, and lightweight solar panels for portable power applications. The consortium consists of NanoFlex, SolAero, the University of Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin. Pursuant to the foregoing and as part of the consortium, SolAero was awarded a 4-year contract amounting to $6.3 million with the Army Research Lab (ARL) to develop solar power mats. SolAero has engaged the Company as a subcontractor for $3.3 million over 4 years of which $1.6 million will be paid to the University of Michigan as a subcontractor to the Company. The Company’s contract with SolAero provides for direct reimbursement of the Company’s costs, including indirect overhead. On February 1, 2019 we were informed by SolAero that Mantech had terminated the contract as provided for in the agreement. The Company will be fully reimbursed for all costs incurred through that date. The Company is attempting to ascertain the reason for the cancellation. Having an established technical team enables us to more effectively pursue and execute sponsored research projects from the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Department of Energy (“DOE”), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), each of which has interests in businesses that can deliver ultra-lightweight, high-efficiency solar technologies for demanding applications. However, there can be no assurance that the Company can effectively pursue such research projects, nor if it can, that such pursuit will be successful.

As reported in the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017, on February 2, 2017, the Company entered into a License Agreement with SolAero Technologies Corp. (“SolAero”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to grant SolAero a non-exclusive worldwide license to use, sell, offer for sale, import or otherwise dispose of certain products (the “Licensed Products”) using the Company’s patented proprietary manufacturing processes relating to Gallium Arsenide-based photovoltaic cells (the “Licensed Patents”) within the space and near-space fields of use (the “License Field”). SolAero is to pay the Company a royalty based on sales of the Licensed Products within the Licensed Field. The agreement does not provide SolAero with the right to sublicense the Licensed Patents. The term of the agreement runs from February 2, 2017 through the expiration date of the last expiring patent included in the Licensed Technology. However, each party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party.
 
There can be no assurance that our overall term operating plan will be successful or that we will be able to fulfill it, as it is largely dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised.
 
Near Term Operating Plan
 
Our near-term focus is on advancing our product development efforts while containing costs. The Company requires approximately $13 million to continue its operations over the next twelve months to support its development and commercialization activities, fund patent application and prosecution, service outstanding liabilities, and support its corporate functions. Our operating plan over the next twelve months is comprised of the following:

1. | Product development and prototype product demonstrations with key customers;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Prioritizing and optimizing our existing IP portfolio to align it with the commercialization strategy and reduce costs;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Development of our product supply chain inclusive of manufacturing and operations organizations;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Development of our sales and marketing organization, website, and other marketing plan resources; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. | Raising adequate capital (approximately $13 million) to support our activities for at least 12 months.

 
The Company believes that it has made progress with each of the components of this operating plan and has aligned its operations and cost structure with expediting the development and commercialization of our high efficiency solar technologies. The Company has taken steps to reduce patent expenses, particularly related to optimizing its OPV patent portfolio. The Company has realigned its research and development operations with several strategic actions, including hiring Company engineers to focus on high efficiency product development and technology transfer from Michigan to a commercial environment. The Company believes that it is making positive progress with these efforts.
 
There can be no assurance that the Company’s near-term operating plan will be successful or that it will be able to fulfill it as it is largely dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised nor that we will be awarded the government contracts that it is currently pursuing.
 
In the event that we raise less than the required amount of capital, our focus is planned to be on prioritizing our commercialization effort to capture near-term revenue opportunities and limiting spending on general and administrative expenses and patent costs.
 
Market Opportunity
 
There are several key trends that we believe are reshaping the future of the global energy mix, including continued rapid growth in the use of solar technologies, a retreat from nuclear power in some countries, and the emergence of unconventional natural gas production. These trends are driving a pronounced shift away from oil, coal, and nuclear towards renewables and natural gas. Expectations are building for a concerted global effort to tackle climate change, according to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2016.

Expansion of solar generation worldwide is a necessary component of any serious strategy to mitigate climate change, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) Energy Initiative. In recent years, solar costs have fallen substantially, and installed capacity has grown very rapidly. Nonetheless, solar energy currently accounts for only about 1% of global electricity generation.
 
Solar PV installations have experienced rapid growth over the past several years. According to IHS Technology, global solar installations were estimated to have reached 77 gigawatts (“GW”) in 2016, 90 GW in 2017 and are forecast to reach 113 GW in 2018.
 
The dominant solar photovoltaics (“PV”) technology, used in approximately 90% of installations, is wafer-based crystalline silicon (“c-Si”), with thin-film technologies, such as cadmium telluride (“CdTe”), copper indium gallium selenide (“CIGS”), and amorphous silicon (“a-Si”), accounting for approximately 10% of the PV market, according to the MIT Energy Initiative. However, current c-Si technologies have inherent technical limitations, including high processing complexity and low intrinsic light absorption, which requires a thick silicon wafer, resulting in rigidity and heavy weight, according to the MIT Energy Initiative. We believe these form factor constraints largely limit the addressable market for crystalline silicon-based solar to rooftop and utility-scale installations, which currently dominate the solar power installed base.
 
The Company plans to initially focus its high efficiency technologies and products on applications that are not well-served by c-Si-based solar panels and rather demand solar solutions with some combination of high power, light weight, and flexibility. These markets include aerospace (space vehicles and UAVs), mobile and field generation, and BIPV and BAPV, where high efficiency GaAs thin films can be applied to multi-story rooftops as well as building facades and IoT applications for solar powered sensors and devices. Likewise, the Company will focus its OPV technologies on products where its highly flexible form factor and semi-transparency add value, such as glazing applications, including skylights, curtain walls, facades, and windows as well as IoT applications for solar powered sensors and devices.
 
Global BIPV installations were 4.9 GW in 2017 and are projected to increase to 11.1 GW in 2020, according to Science Direct Energy Procedia (2017) 993-999. We expect adoption of BIPV solutions will be driven in part by Net Zero Energy Building (“NZEB”) regulations, which require buildings to produce as much energy as it uses over the course of a year. NZEB goals are achieved through a combination of energy efficiency measures and onsite renewable energy generation. The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) has set several NZEB goals, including targeting all new residential construction and all new commercial construction within the State to be net zero energy by 2020 and 2030, respectively, and 50% of existing buildings will be required to retrofit to meet NZEB goals by 2030.
 
Competition
 
The Company is focused on developing commercializing and licensing advanced solar technologies that will enable entry of solar PV into new applications and also potentially compete with established solar technologies in traditional solar markets.
 
The solar PV sector is highly competitive, characterized by intense price competition among commercialized technologies and aggressive investment in emerging technologies as companies attempt to compete within the solar markets as well as within the overall electric power industry. The current solar market is dominated by c-Si technology, with some penetration by CdTe and CIGS thin film technologies, according to SolarBuzz. C-Si solar cells are produced at massive scale and have established a low-cost position within the rooftop and utility-scale PV markets. Advanced solar technology development efforts encompass various multiple technology platforms at various stages of development.
 
Within emerging applications, we anticipate our technologies will compete primarily with advanced technologies on a basis of cost and performance, but importantly on functionality and aesthetics as we open new applications to solar power. Additionally, we believe that we will compete with other research and development organizations for funding from government agencies, laboratories, research institutions, and universities. Some of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole.

High efficiency compound semiconductor solar technologies have been limited to specialty, niche applications due to their high costs; although numerous research efforts are focused on reducing manufacturing costs. Within the high efficiency solar sector, there are a small number of manufacturers, including Spectrolab, a subsidiary of The Boeing Company; SolAero, Azur Space (Germany); MicroLink Devices; Sharp Corporation (Japan); Alta Devices, a subsidiary of Hanergy Thin Film (China); Spectrolab, SolAero, and Azur Space produce commercial GaAs solar cells for highly specialized applications such as military and space-borne systems, which are inelastic to the high prices associated with the technology. Some of these companies are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs to enable entry of high efficiency compound semiconductor solar technologies into commercial terrestrial markets. We believe the Company’s patented GaAs ND-ELO and mini-concentration technologies present the opportunity to significantly reduce the cost for high efficiency solutions and believe that we could potentially license our technology to these companies.
 
OPV technologies are in the development stage, with numerous activities ongoing among government laboratories, universities, and private enterprises. Currently, we are not aware of any commercialized OPV technologies, but we believe there are a limited number of developers planning introduction within the next several years.
 
Ongoing research and development on OPV materials and devices are currently being performed by Heliatek (Dresden, Germany); Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation; LG Chemical; BELECTRIC OPV (Kolitzheim, Germany); Solvay (Brussels, Belgium; acquired Plextronics); Polyera (Skokie, Illinois); and Solarmer Energy (El Monte, California); among others. Research institutions may also become our competitors, such as University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Berkley, Fraunhofer-Institut fur Solare Energiesysteme (ISE), Empa, a Swiss federal laboratory for materials science and technology. We believe the Company’s exclusive intellectual property rights surrounding technologies for small molecule OPVs present a formidable obstacle for those wishing to compete with us and present opportunities for potential partnerships.
 
Regulation
 
The Company has not yet introduced commercial products and, as such, has not commenced any governmental approval process. The Company anticipates that the applicability and extent of government approval requirements will depend on the particular end-market. Successful introduction of our products into certain markets may require significant government testing and evaluation prior to high volume procurement. We anticipate that the installation of products based on our high efficiency and OPV technologies will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering and related matters.
 
Governments implement various policies to facilitate the adoption of solar power, including customer-focused financial incentives such as capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net metering. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
 
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. In certain developing countries, governments are establishing initiatives to expand access to electricity, including initiatives to support off-grid rural electrification using solar power.
 
Employees
 
Currently, the Company employees consist of seven full-time personnel – our Chief Executive Officer, five engineers, and an office manager. The Company’s Chief Technology Officer provides support on a consulting basis. Depending on the availability of capital, the Company plans to expand its engineering team, hiring process and product engineers to support stage gate product development leading to product launches and licensing agreements. In addition, the Company expects to hire marketing and supply chain organizations.
