Item 1.    Business
GENERAL
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (“A&F”), a company incorporated in Delaware in 1996, through its subsidiaries (collectively, A&F and its subsidiaries are referred to as the “Company” and “we”), is a global, digitally led omnichannel retailer. The Company offers a broad assortment of apparel, personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids, which are sold primarily through its digital channels and Company-owned stores, as well as through various third-party arrangements. The Company’s two brand-based operating segments are Hollister, which includes the Company’s Hollister, Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist brands, and Abercrombie, which includes the Company’s Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. These five brands share a commitment to offering unique products of enduring quality and exceptional comfort that allow customers around the world to express their own individuality and style. The Company operates primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. 
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. This typically results in a fifty-two-week year, but occasionally gives rise to an additional week, resulting in a fifty-three-week year. Fiscal years are designated in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, as well as the remainder of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commenced. All references herein to the Company’s fiscal years are as follows:

Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines and the Company experienced widespread temporary store closures. As of January 29, 2022, all U.S. Company-operated stores were fully open for in-store service; however, temporary store closures have subsequently been mandated in certain parts of the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region in response to COVID-19. During periods of temporary store closures, reductions in revenue have not been offset by proportional decreases in expense, as the Company continues to incur store occupancy costs such as operating lease costs, net of rent abatements agreed upon during the period, depreciation expense, and certain other costs such as compensation, net of government payroll relief, and administrative expenses resulting in a negative effect on the relationship between the Company’s costs and revenues.
Although U.S. and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains and temporary store closures. The extent of future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, are uncertain as current circumstances are dynamic and depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the emergence of new variants of coronavirus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, and the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines, boosters or medical treatments. The Company plans to follow the guidance of local governments to evaluate whether future store closures will be necessary. 
The Company’s digital operations across brands have continued to serve the Company’s customers during periods of temporary store closures. In response to elevated digital demand during this period, the Company leveraged its omnichannel capabilities by continuing to offer Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store, including curbside pickup at a majority of U.S. locations, and by utilizing ship-from-store capabilities, including same-day delivery across its entire U.S. store fleet. Despite the recent strength in digital sales, the Company has historically generated the majority of its annual net sales through stores and there can be no assurance that the current level of digital penetration will continue when stores operate at full capacity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
STRATEGY AND KEY BUSINESS PRIORITIES
The Company remains committed to, and confident in, its long-term vision of being a leading digitally-led omnichannel global apparel retailer. The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to make progress against initiatives that support this vision, while balancing the near-term challenges and the continued global uncertainty presented by COVID-19 and the changing global geopolitical environment.
Navigating COVID-19 and current geopolitical landscape
As discussed above under “Impact of COVID-19”, the Company’s progress executing against its key transformation initiatives prior to Fiscal 2020 created the foundation to allow the Company to respond quickly to COVID-19. The Company remains focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19.
The Company continues to monitor the latest developments regarding the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related economic measures taken by the United States, European Union and others. The Company has no associates, stores or direct operations in Russia or Ukraine, and no significant direct exposure to the Russian ruble. The duration and outcome of this conflict, any retaliatory actions taken by Russia and the impact on regional or global economies is unknown, but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Omnichannel initiatives
As customer shopping preferences continue to shift and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, the Company aims to create best-in-class customer experiences and grow total company profitability by delivering improvements through a continuous test-and-learn approach. Stores were the primary fulfillment point for orders prior to Fiscal 2020. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2020, the Company experienced an acceleration in sales fulfilled through the digital channel. Despite, this acceleration in channel shift, stores continue to be an important part of the customers’ omnichannel experience and the Company believes that the customers’ experience is improved by its offering of omnichannel capabilities, which include: 
•Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store, allowing customers to purchase merchandise through one of the Company’s websites or mobile apps and pick-up the merchandise in store, which often drives incremental in-store sales;
•Curbside pickup at a majority of U.S. locations.
•Same-day delivery service across its entire U.S. store fleet. Each brand’s website features a “Get It Fast” filter to easily find products that are available, or shoppers can choose the same-day delivery option for available items at checkout. 
•Order-in-Store, allowing customers to shop the brands’ in-store and online offerings while in-store;
•Reserve-in-Store, allowing customers to reserve merchandise online and try it on in-store before purchase;
•Ship-from-Store, which allows the Company to ship in-store merchandise to customers and increases inventory productivity; and
•Cross-channel returns, allowing customers to return merchandise purchased through one channel to a different channel.
The Company also believes that its loyalty programs, Hollister’s Club Cali® and Abercrombie’s myAbercrombie®, are important parts of its omnichannel strategy as the Company aims to seamlessly interact and connect with customers across all touchpoints through members-only offers, items and experiences. Under these programs, customers accumulate points primarily based on purchase activity and earn rewards as points are converted at certain thresholds. These rewards can be redeemed for merchandise discounts either in-store or online. The loyalty programs continue to provide timely customer insights and the Company believes these programs contribute to higher average transaction value.

Digital operations
In order to create a more seamless shopping experience for its customers, the Company continues to invest in its digital infrastructure. The Company has the capability to ship merchandise to customers in more than 110 countries and process transactions in 28 currencies and through 28 forms of payment globally. The Company operates desktop and mobile websites for its brands globally, which are available in various local languages, and four mobile apps. In addition, in its efforts to expand its international brand reach, the Company also partners with certain third-party e-commerce platforms. The Company continues to develop its mobile capabilities as mobile engagement continues to grow, with over 80% of the Company’s digital traffic generated from mobile devices in Fiscal 2021. 
Store operations
The Company continues to thoughtfully open new stores and invest in smaller omni-enabled store experiences that align with local customer shopping preferences. New store formats are designed to provide the opportunity for higher productivity in a smaller footprint. During Fiscal 2021, the Company opened 38 new store locations, remodeled two store locations and right-sized an additional five store locations. Hollister and Abercrombie both have stores in updated formats, which are designed to be open and inviting, and include accommodating features such as innovative fitting rooms and omnichannel capabilities. These stores are tailored to reflect the personality of each brand, with unique furniture, fixtures, music and scent adding to a rich brand experience. The Company’s stores continue to play an essential role in creating brand awareness serving as physical gateways to the brands. Stores also serve as local hubs for online engagement as the Company continues to grow its omnichannel capabilities to create seamless shopping experiences. 
The Company continues to evaluate and manage its store fleet through its ongoing global store network optimization initiative and has taken actions to optimize store productivity by remodeling, right-sizing or relocating stores to smaller square footage locations, and closing legacy stores. As part of this initiative, the Company closed two flagship locations during Fiscal 2021, leaving the Company with five operating flagships at the end of Fiscal 2021, down from seven at the beginning of the year. In addition, the Company closed 42 non-flagship locations, resulting in 44 total store closures during Fiscal 2021. These actions reduced total Company store gross square footage by approximately 0.2 million gross square feet, or 3%, as compared to Fiscal 2020 year-end. The actions taken in Fiscal 2021 continued to transform the Company's operating model and reposition the Company for the future as the Company continues to focus on aligning store square footage with digital penetration.
All of the retail stores operated by the Company, as of January 29, 2022, are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers. These leases generally have initial terms of between five and ten years. Certain leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. The leases expire at various dates between Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2032.
As of January 29, 2022, the Company operated 729 retail stores as detailed in the table below:

Third-party operations

As of January 29, 2022, the Company had nine wholesale partnerships, primarily internationally. As of January 29, 2022, the Company’s franchisees operated 23 international franchise stores across the brands located in Mexico, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co. | 2021 Form 10-K

SOURCING OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
The Company works with its network of third-party vendors to supply compelling, on-trend and high-quality product assortments to its customers. These vendors are expected to respect local laws and have committed to follow the standards set forth in the Company’s Vendor Code of Conduct, which details the Company’s dedication to human rights, labor rights, environmental responsibility and workplace safety.
The Company sourced merchandise through approximately 114 vendors located in 16 countries, including the U.S., during Fiscal 2021. The Company’s largest vendor accounted for approximately 14% of merchandise sourced in Fiscal 2021, based on the cost of sourced merchandise. The Company believes its product sourcing is appropriately distributed among vendors. 
Refer to Note 6, “INVENTORIES,” for a summary of inventory sourced based on vendor location and dollar cost of merchandise receipts during Fiscal 2021.
DISTRIBUTION OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
The Company’s distribution network is built to deliver inventory to Company-operated and international franchise stores and fulfill digital and wholesale orders with speed and efficiency. Generally, merchandise is shipped directly from vendors to the Company’s distribution centers, where it is received and inspected before being shipped to the Company’s stores or its digital or wholesale customers.
The Company relies on both Company-owned and third-party distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of its merchandise. Additional information pertaining to certain of the Company’s distribution centers as of January 29, 2022 follows:

Location | Company-owned or third-party
New Albany, Ohio (Primarily serves store and digital operations) | Company-owned 
New Albany, Ohio (Serves only digital operations) | Company-owned 
Bergen op Zoom, Netherlands | Third-party 
Shanghai, China | Third-party 

During Fiscal 2021, the Company opened a facility in the Phoenix, Arizona, which replaced the Company’s third-party distribution center in Reno, Nevada to increase capacity and improve fulfillment capabilities. The Company primarily used four contract carriers to ship merchandise and related materials to its North American customers, and several contract carriers for its international customers during Fiscal 2021.
COMPETITION
The Company operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Competitors include: individual and chain specialty apparel retailers; local, regional, national and international department stores; discount stores; and online- exclusive businesses. Additionally, the Company competes for consumers’ discretionary spend with businesses in other product and experiential categories such as technology, restaurants, travel and media content. 
The Company competes primarily on the basis of differentiating its brands from competition through: product, higher quality and increased newness; brand voice, amplifying and consolidating brand messaging; and experience, investing in immersive, participatory omnichannel shopping environments.
Operating in a highly competitive industry environment can cause the Company to engage in greater than expected promotional activity, which would result in pressure on average unit retail and gross profit. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - Our failure to operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential impacts competition may have on the Company. 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
Historically, the Company’s operations have been seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters (“Spring”) and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters (“Fall”). The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during Fall, due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods. Refer to “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

The Company strives to create a culture that not only drives strategic and key business priorities forward, but is welcoming, inclusive, diverse and encourages associates to create a positive impact in their global communities. The Company believes that the strength of its unique culture is a competitive advantage, and intends to continue building upon that culture to improve performance across its business. This will become even more important as the Company expands globally and works towards achieving its long-term vision of being a leading digitally-led omnichannel global apparel retailer.
Therefore, the Company believes that the attraction, retention, and management of qualified talent representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets - and fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment - are integral to its success in advancing the Company’s strategies and key business priorities and avoiding disruptions in the business. The Company relies on its associates across the organization, including those at its corporate offices, stores, and distribution centers, as well as their experience and expertise in the retail business. Examples of key initiatives that are intended to attract, retain, and manage the Company’s human capital resources include the following: 
•Offering competitive compensation and benefits, including cash-based and equity-based incentive awards in order to align the interests of associates and stockholders. Maintaining competitive compensation and benefit programs helps the Company attract, motivate, and retain the key talent necessary to achieve outstanding business and financial results. In 2021, the Company expanded the pool of associates eligible to receive cash-based, performance-based incentive awards to include additional job levels. In addition, the Company continues to evolve its consideration of and approach to work flexibility, including supporting remote work arrangements for key roles and “work from anywhere days and weeks” for our corporate home office associates where feasible.
•Improving associate engagement through open communication channels and with a focus on development. The Company regularly holds all-company meetings to communicate with its associates. The Company also collects feedback through various engagement surveys to better understand associate experience and drive improvements, with the most recent organization-wide survey conducted in August 2021.
•Fostering associate development by providing a wide variety of growth and development opportunities throughout associates’ careers in order to be able to pivot resources to align with overall corporate strategies when necessary. This includes stretch assignments, internal career pathing, self-awareness exercises, and active coaching. The Company also uses leadership standards to help associates identify the core behaviors essential for their career growth, as well as personal growth, on their journey at the Company. 

Abercrombie & Fitch Co. | 2021 Form 10-K

•Embracing diversity and inclusion in all forms, including gender, race, ethnicity, disability, nationality, religion, age, veteran, LGBTQIA+ status, and other factors. The Company continuously reviews representation, pay, and promotion among associates with diverse backgrounds, including those in senior leadership positions. The Company also encourages associates to enhance their understanding of diversity and inclusion through the Company’s various associate resource groups, which allow associates from different business functions around the world to discuss relevant topics and help address region-specific needs. Additionally, the Company invests in year-round competency building training for associates on topics of bias, allyship, and advocacy. 
•Encouraging community involvement by promoting various charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs, which fosters a collaborative and rewarding work environment. The Company provides support to global organizations in the form of donations, volunteerism and in-kind support. In partnership with its customers and associates, the Company is proud to support community partners with a focus on youth mental health and wellness, diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental advocacy. The Company supports its associates in giving back to the community through volunteering by offering associates a paid volunteer day each year for eligible volunteer work. 
•Focusing on the health and safety of its associates by investing in various wellness programs throughout the year that are designed to enhance the physical, financial, and mental well-being of its associates globally. The Company is committed to providing a safe working environment for our people, as well as supporting our people in achieving and maintaining their health and well-being goals. To support this commitment, the Company provides benefits-eligible associates and their families with access to free and confidential counseling through our Employee Assistance Program, as well as free access to Headspace, a mediation and mindfulness app, and also provides regular programming on financial planning and mental-health. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and continue to implement safety measures in all our facilities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our customers and our store associates, our distribution center associates, and our corporate associates who returned to the office. During Fiscal 2021, certain segments of the Company’s corporate associate population continued to work-from-home, and after thoughtful planning and while following appropriate laws and health guidance, the Company implemented phased return-to-office protocols. The Company also provided associates with access to vaccinations by hosting multiple vaccine and booster clinics for global home office and distribution center associates. 
The Company employed approximately 31,500 associates globally as of January 29, 2022, of whom approximately 24,500 were part-time associates. As of January 29, 2022, the Company employed approximately 22,800 associates in the U.S., and employed approximately 8,700 associates outside of the U.S. The Company employs temporary, seasonal associates at times, particularly during Fall, when it experiences its greatest sales activity due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods. 
The number of associates represented by works councils and unions is not significant and is generally limited to associates in the Company’s European stores. 
Board oversight
A&F’s Board of Directors and its committees also play an integral role in the Company’s human capital management. For example, the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s strategies, policies and practices regarding social issues and trends, including diversity and inclusion initiatives, health and safety, human rights, and philanthropy and community investment matters. In addition, among other things, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s overall compensation structure, policies and programs, as well as administration of our cash-based and equity-based performance incentive programs. Members of the Board of Directors also review succession plans for the Company’s executive officers and discuss with senior leadership the Company’s human capital management strategies, programs, policies and practices, including those relating to organizational structure and key reporting relationships, along with development of strategies and practices relating to recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s associates as needed.
