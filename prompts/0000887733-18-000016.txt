Item 1. Business
Our Company
Central Garden & Pet Company (“Central”) is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States. The total annual retail sales of the pet food, treats & chews, supplies and live animal industry in 2017 was estimated by Packaged Facts and the pet industry to have been approximately $58.3 billion. We estimate the annual retail sales of the pet supplies, live animal, and treats & chews and natural pet food markets in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $27.3 billion. The total lawn and garden consumables, decorative products and live plant industry in the United States is estimated by Packaged Facts and IBISWorld to be approximately $33.2 billion in annual retail sales in 2017, including fertilizer, pesticides, growing media, seeds, mulch, other consumables, decorative products and live plants.

Acquisitions
General Pet Supply
In April 2018, we purchased substantially all of the assets of General Pet Supply, a leading Midwestern U.S. supplier of pet food and supplies for approximately $24 million. The acquisition is expected to broaden our national pet supplies distribution footprint, expand our pet food distribution business and provide us with access to the veterinary channel.
Bell Nursery
In March 2018, we purchased Bell Nursery, a leading grower and distributor of live flowers and plants in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, for approximately $61 million and contingent consideration up to $10 million. The acquisition is expected to complement our existing garden portfolio.
We also purchased two small wholesale distributors of fish and small animals during fiscal 2018 for approximately $8 million.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have a number of competitive strengths, which serve as the foundation of our business strategy, including the following:

• | Market Leadership Positions Built on a Strong Brand Portfolio. We are one of the leaders in the U.S. pet supplies market and in the U.S. consumer lawn and garden supplies market. We have a diversified portfolio of brands, many of which we believe are among the leading brands in their respective U.S. market categories. The majority of our brands have been marketed and sold for more than 30 years.


• | History of Innovative New Products and Customer Service. We continuously seek to introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and in new product categories. Over the last two years, we have received a number of awards for innovation, customer service and marketing.

Innovation
For innovation in 2018, Kaytee won the Pet Business Industry award in the small animal toys category, both Global Pet Expo and Super Zoo awards in the small animal category for new product with Premium Timothy Hay Treats, and Pet Valu's Best New Product in Small Pet award; Zilla won a Global Pet and Super Zoo award for the Reptile Spring Cave Accessory and a Super Zoo award for vertical decor; and for the second consecutive year, Aqueon won Pet Valu's Best New Product award for the Neo Glow fish tank. Also in 2018, Farnam's Super Mask won EquineSeniors.com's "Good-Horsekeeping" award for Best Fly Mask with Ears.
In 2017, Central won Walmart's Innovation Award for a private label program, and the Pet segment's Kaytee brand won awards at Global Pet for the LED Run-About Ball, the CritterHome Habitat and the CritterTrail Display. Also in 2017, the CritterTrail LED Habitat won the Pet Business Industry Recognition Award and Zilla's Front Opening Terrarium won a Global Pet Award while its Floating Basking Platforms won the Pet Business Editor's Choice. Additionally, in 2017, Aqueon won the Pet Product News Editor's Choice Award for QuietFlow LED Pro Filters and Pro Sol Light Fixtures as well as the Pet Retail Brands' Best New Product Award for the Aqueon Betta Puzzle modular enclosure. 
Customer Service
For customer service in 2018, the Garden segment has been recognized by Lowe's for the third consecutive year as its Lawn & Garden Supplier of the Year. In 2018, the Pet segment won Petco’s Strategic Initiative Vendor in Companion Animal and Pet Valu’s awards for Highest Sales Service Level and Highest Year over Year Sales Growth in Aquatic & Reptile. 
In 2017, the Garden segment won several awards from our largest customers including one of Lowe's three highest awards as Seasonal Vendor of the Year, Walmart's Supplier of the Year in Lawn & Garden and Walmart's H3 (Humble, Hustle & Hungry) Award. In 2017, the Pet segment won the Pet Retail Brands Specialty Pet Vendor Partner of the Year Award for efforts in building strategic relationships and offering the highest level of support and collaboration.
Marketing
For marketing in 2018, Central won numerous Equine media awards from American Horse Publications and National Animal Supplement Council’s Visibility Awards for advertising, marketing, multimedia ads, social media campaigns, print and education of customers and the industry. 
In 2017, Central won Summit Creative Awards for its S.L.A.P. Public Service Campaign for Mosquito Awareness and its Bug Free Grains Ad Campaign in the B2B category as well as numerous American Horse Publications Awards for print, e-newsletter, website and brand multi-media ad campaigns.

• | Strong Relationships with Retailers. We have developed strong relationships with major and independent brick & mortar retailers, as well as e-commerce retailers providing them broad product offerings including new product innovation, premium brands, private label programs, proprietary sales and logistics capabilities and a high level of customer service. Major retailers value the efficiency of dealing with suppliers with national scope and strong brands. We believe our ability to meet their unique needs for packaging and point of sale displays provides us with a competitive advantage. Independent retailers value our high level of customer service and broad array of premium branded products. We believe these strengths have assisted us in becoming one of the largest pet supplies vendors to PetSmart, PETCO and Walmart and among the largest lawn and garden supplies vendors to Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s, and the club and mass merchandise channels, as well as a leading supplier to independent pet and garden supplies retailers in the United States.


• | Favorable Long-Term Industry Characteristics. We believe the U.S. pet supplies market will grow over the long-term due to favorable demographic and leisure trends. The key demographics bolstering our markets are the growth rates in the number of millennials who now account for 35% of pet owners and account for more than half of small animal, reptile and saltwater fish owners. According to the 2017 - 2018 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, the number of U.S. pet owners in recent years has reached record highs, with 84.6 million households, or 68%, owning a pet. In addition, many pet supplies products (e.g., toys, pest control, grooming supplies, beds and collars, etc.) are routinely consumed and replenished. Also, as many as 82% of dog owners and 65% of cat owners regularly purchase some type of treat. 

We believe that gardening is one of the most popular leisure activities in the United States. According to the National Gardening Survey, U.S. households participating in lawn and garden activities is at an all-time high of 77% with 
3

participation by 18-34-year-old households also at an all-time high. Participation is highest amongst married households, persons aged 45-64, households with three or more persons; households with children; employed and those persons making $75,000 or more per year. Both the 18-34 and 45-64 demographic participation percentages are projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to remain consistent for the foreseeable future. The 2018 National Gardening Survey also notes that the trends of more people gardening in their yards, container gardening, food gardening and organic gardening are examples of wider interest in a rapidly changing industry. We perceive this market as staying intact and showing slow positive growth.

• | Sales and Logistics Networks. We are a leading supplier to independent specialty retailers for the pet and lawn and garden supplies markets through our sales and logistics networks. We believe our sales and logistics networks give us a significant competitive advantage over other suppliers. These networks provide us with key access to independent pet specialty retail stores and retail lawn and garden customers that require two-step distribution facilitating:


◦ | acquisition and maintenance of shelf placement;


◦ | prompt product replenishment;


◦ | customization of retailer programs;


◦ | quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences;


◦ | rapid deployment and feedback for new products; and


◦ | immediate exposure for new internally-developed and acquired brands.

We plan to continue to utilize our team of dedicated sales people and our sales and logistics networks to expand sales of our branded products.
Business Strategy
Our objective is to grow revenues, profits, and cash flow by enhancing our position as one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies industries. We seek to do so by developing new products, increasing market share, acquiring businesses and working in partnership with our customers to grow the categories in which we participate. To achieve our objective, we plan to capitalize on our strengths and favorable industry trends by executing on the following key strategic pillars to drive our growth:
Accelerate the Growth Momentum of Our Portfolio.

• | We are managing each business differentially, based on clearly articulated strategies that define the role of each business within our portfolio. We have assessed the profitability and growth potential of each of our businesses. All businesses have a clear role in the portfolio and a strategy that is consistent with that role. Some of our businesses are managed to optimize top-line growth, whereas others are more focused on reducing costs and maximizing operating income. We have three-year pipelines in both innovation activities and cost savings initiatives to make sure we have the pieces in place to deliver the organic growth targeted for our businesses. 


• | We are building out our portfolio in attractive, broadly-defined Pet & Garden markets. We seek to acquire businesses that are accretive to our growth. Our M&A model is one of our key strengths. Since 1992, we have completed over 50 acquisitions to create a company of approximately $2.2 billion in sales. In the last two years, we have acquired four new businesses including our entry into the live plant business. We consider this to be an attractive, fragmented category in the garden industry. We are patient and disciplined value buyers, typically focused on manageable-sized opportunities in the garden and pet areas. However, we are open to any business which can leverage our capabilities and allow us to add value through our low-cost manufacturing capabilities, operating synergies, or strong distribution network. We generally prefer to acquire businesses with proven, seasoned management teams, which are committed to stay with the acquired business after closing. We have been successful in growing our acquisitions organically after acquiring them into our portfolio. We are also committed to exiting businesses where we cannot find a path to profitability and have done so in the past. We continually review our businesses to ensure they can meet our expectations and, in some cases, have implemented strategies to reverse sub-par performance.

Keep the Core Healthy.

• | We are building on our strong customer relationships by developing and executing winning category growth strategies. We produce both branded products and private label products for our customers as well as distribute third party brands that gives our retail partners an unparalleled breadth of selection of premium and value products. Importantly, we are reinvesting some of our annual cost savings in order to ensure sufficient demand creation investment to drive sustainable organic growth and build share. 


• | To grow, we are also seeking to develop more differentiated and more defensible new products. We are doing so by continuously striving to get a deeper understanding of our consumers, comprehending what products and features they desire and how they make their purchase decisions. We are increasing our overall investment in consumer insights and research and development in order to achieve our innovation goals with a strong pipeline of new products. 

Build Digital Capabilities for Competitive Advantage and a Compelling Consumer Experience. 

• | We are freeing up our businesses in e-commerce by ensuring we have the right policies, products, and programs to allow all channels to compete effectively. We recognize that consumers are increasingly researching, if not buying products on-line, and hence we are advancing our digital capabilities. One key area is in marketing communication where we are working to better reach consumers at key points in their path to purchase with advanced capabilities in search engine optimization, reputation management and social listening to name a few. Concurrently, we are optimizing our supply chain for high-demand e-commerce items to ensure customer and consumer availability requirements are met at optimal cost. Finally, we are also expanding our data analytics capability to improve and accelerate business insight. In a marketplace that is moving very quickly, fast decision-making is important to gaining a competitive advantage. 

Drive Cost Savings and Productivity Improvements to Fuel Growth.

• | Optimizing our supply chain footprint is a priority as we seek to become more efficient and cost-effective. Having the right facilities in the right locations is critical to both lowering costs and enabling our businesses to meet the growth demands of our existing and new customers, from both our legacy and acquired businesses. In addition, while we value being a decentralized company, we believe we have significant opportunities to improve our performance by driving processes and programs to allow us to align for scale and share best practices. The initiatives, along with our systematic cost savings programs being driven by each business unit, should enable the overall company to reduce our cost of goods sold and administrative spending by 1% to 2% annually. We expect these cost savings will enable us to continue to invest more in our businesses to fuel growth. 

Attract, Retain and Develop Exceptional Employees.

• | We have approximately 5,400 employees in over 95 locations. We believe people work at Central because they love the categories in which we operate and that creates a passionate and effective group. We also have a strong leadership team representing a mix of successful entrepreneurs and classically trained consumer products executives that have delivered favorable growth over the last few years. We place an emphasis on helping our employees develop their skills and focus on succession planning to ensure we can grow sustainably year-after-year.

Pet Segment
Pet Overview
We are one of the leading marketers and producers of pet supplies in the United States. In addition, our Pet segment operates one of the largest sales and logistics networks in the industry, strategically supporting our brands. In fiscal 2018, Pet segment net sales were $1,340.9 million and operating income was $140.3 million.
Pet Industry Background
According to the Packaged Facts U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2018 - 2019, the percentage of U.S. households with dogs or cats in 2017 remained at 52% where it has been since 2011.
The pet industry includes food, supplies, veterinarian care, services and live animals. We operate primarily in the pet supplies segment of the industry as well as in the live fish and live small animal categories. This segment includes: products for dogs and cats, including edible bones, premium healthy edible and non-edible chews, rawhide, toys, pet beds, pet carriers, grooming supplies and other accessories; products for birds, small animals and specialty pets, including cages and habitats, toys, chews, and related accessories; animal and household health and insect control products; products for fish, reptiles and other aquarium-based pets, including aquariums, furniture and lighting fixtures, pumps, filters, water conditioners and supplements, and information and knowledge resources; and products for horses and livestock. Packaged Facts estimates that the pet supplies, natural dog and cat food, pet treats & chews and live fish, small animals and pet birds industry had $27.3 billion in revenue in 2017.
We believe the U.S. pet supplies market will grow over the long-term due to favorable demographic and leisure trends. The key demographics bolstering our markets are the growth rates in the number of millennials who now account for 35% of pet owners and account for more than half of small animal, reptile and saltwater fish owners. According to the 2017 - 2018 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, the number of U.S. pet owners in recent years has reached record highs, with 84.6 million households, or 68%, owning a pet. In addition, many pet supplies products (e.g., toys, pest control, grooming supplies, beds and collars, etc.) are routinely consumed and replenished. Also, as many as 82% of dog owners and 65% of cat owners regularly purchase some type of treat.
The U.S. pet supplies market is highly fragmented with approximately 1,400 manufacturers, consisting primarily of small companies with limited product lines. The majority of these manufacturers do not have a captive sales and logistics network and must rely on us or other independent distributors to supply their products to regional pet specialty chains and independent retailers. According to Packaged Facts, dog & cat supplies sales increased 21% from 2013 to 2017. Sales are expected to increase an additional 17% by 2022, indicating the strength of this category.
The pet food and supplies industry retail channel also remains fragmented with only two national pet specialty retailers, PetSmart and PETCO and over 7,300 independent pet supply stores and smaller pet chains as well as club and mass merchandise stores in the United States. According to Packaged Facts, pet specialty chain sales have declined from 24% in 2014 to a projected 20% of overall pet product sales in 2018, and are expected to decline to 16% by 2022. At the same time, internet sales (including online sales by omnichannel players) are expected to have increased from 5% in 2014 to 15% in 2018 and are projected to increase to 20% of U.S. retail sales of pet products by 2022. Pet products have also become a growing category in mass merchandisers, discounters, grocery outlets and the e-commerce channel. Mass merchandisers, supermarkets and discounters have historically carried a limited product assortment that features primarily pet food, but we believe these retailers are devoting more shelf space to meet increased consumer demand for premium pet supplies. Independent pet stores typically have a relatively broad product selection and attempt to differentiate themselves by offering premier brands and knowledgeable service.
Proprietary Branded Pet Products
Our principal pet supplies categories are dog and cat, aquatics, bird and small animal, wild bird feed, live fish and small animal, and animal health products.
Dog & Cat. Our dog and cat category, featuring the brands Nylabone®, Four Paws®, Cadet®, Dallas Manufacturing Company (DMC™), K&H Pet Products™, TFH® Publications, AvoDerm®, Pinnacle®, Pet Select and Mikki®, is an industry leader in manufacturing and marketing premium edible and non-edible chews, interactive toys, natural dog and cat food, grooming supplies and pet care print and digital content. 

• | Nylabone is predominately made in the United States and has a strong history of developing innovative products such as NutriDent® Edible Dental Brush Chews, Nubz® and Healthy Edibles® as well as numerous other award-winning dog toys and healthy chews.

• | Four Paws Products include industry leaders in grooming and waste management products under the Wee Wee® and Magic Coat® brands.


• | Pet Home Essentials combines our acquisition of DMC, the industry-leading dog & cat bed company and supplier to many of the largest retailers for private label and branded bedding, and our acquisition of K&H, a producer of premium pet supplies and the largest marketer of heated pet products in the country.


• | TFH Publications is a globally recognized publisher of both pet books and an aquatics magazine.


• | Breeder’s Choice, featuring the Pinnacle and AvoDerm brands, is a manufacturer of natural pet food for our own brands, other parties and private label.

Aquatics. We are a leading supplier of aquariums and related fixtures and furniture, water conditioners and supplements, sophisticated lighting systems and accessories featuring the brands Aqueon, Zilla, Kent Marine, Coralife and Blagdon.
Small Animal, Pet Bird & Wild Bird Feed. We are a leading marketer and producer of supplies and pet food for small animals, pet birds, and wild birds. We offer a full range of products including species specific diets, treats, habitats, bedding, hay and toys under the Kaytee®, Forti-Diet and Critter Trail® brands. Many of our branded Kaytee wild bird mixes are treated with a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. Kaytee is one of the most widely recognized and trusted brands for birds and small animals. 
Animal Health. We are a leading marketer and producer of mosquito and other insect control products produced by Wellmark International and sold primarily under the Bio Spot Active Care™, Adams, Altosid®, Centynal™, ClariFly®IGR, Comfort Zone®, Diacon®, Pre Strike and Extinguish® brand names. Wellmark is the only domestic producer of (S)-Methoprene, which is an active ingredient to control mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, ants and mites in many professional and consumer insect control applications. We also sell (S)-Methoprene to manufacturers of other insect control products, including Frontline Plus. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of innovative products for horses in the fly control, supplements, grooming, deworming, wound care, leather care & rodenticides categories. Our portfolio of brands includes Farnam, Horse Health Products, Vita Flex, Just One Bite and Rodentex. These brands, along with a diverse stable of sub-brands (including IverCare®, Bronco®, Super Mask® II, Endure®, Red Cell®, Horseshoer’s Secret® and Vetrolin®), position us as a leader in these categories.
Live Fish and Small Animals.  We are a leading wholesaler of aquarium fish and small animals to pet specialty and mass merchandiser stores in the U.S. due to our acquisition of Segrest, Inc. in October 2016.
Pet Sales Network
Our domestic sales and logistics network exists to promote both our proprietary brands and third-party partner brands. It provides value-added service to approximately 6,000 customers, many of which are independent specialty stores with fewer than 10 locations. This includes acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick response to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for acquired brands. The combination of brands in the network that are supplied in single shipments enables our independent customers to work with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their pet supplies requirements. We also operate a sales and logistics facility in the United Kingdom.
Pet Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is multi-tiered and designed to capture maximum market share with retailers. Our customers include retailers, such as club, regional and national specialty pet stores, independent pet retailers, mass merchants, grocery and drug stores, as well as the e-commerce channel. We also serve the professional market with insect control and health and wellness products for use by veterinarians, municipalities, farmers and equine product suppliers. Costco Wholesale accounted for approximately 11% of our Pet segment's net sales in fiscal 2018. PetSmart, PETCO, Walmart and Amazon are also significant customers.
To optimize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, our focused sales resources are segmented as follows:

• | a sales organization operating by category and channel;


• | dedicated account teams servicing our largest customers;


• | a group of account managers focused on regional chains;


• | a geographic based group of territory managers dedicated to the independent retailer; and


• | a specialized group of account managers dedicated to the professional and equine markets.

7

These sales teams deliver our marketing strategy that is consumer, brand and channel driven. We provide value creation with a focus on innovation, product quality and performance, premium packaging, product positioning and consumer value. We collaborate closely with our customers to identify their needs, jointly develop strategies to meet those needs and deliver programs that include print, broadcast, direct mail and digital execution.
Pet Competition
The pet supplies industry is highly competitive and has experienced considerable consolidation. The e-commerce channel has been growing at a rapid rate in recent years. Our branded pet products compete against national and regional branded products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in the product categories we participate in are Spectrum Brands and Hartz Mountain. The Pet segment competes primarily on the basis of brand recognition, innovation, upscale packaging, quality and service. Our Pet segment’s sales and logistics operations compete with Animal Supply Co., Phillips Pet Food & Supplies and a number of smaller local and regional distributors, with competition based on product selection, price, value-added services and personal relationships.
Garden Segment
Garden Overview
We are a leading company in the consumer lawn and garden market in the United States and offer both premium and value-oriented branded products. We market and produce a broad array of premium brands, including Pennington, The Rebels, AMDRO, Lilly Miller, Ironite, Sevin, and Over-N-Out. We also produce value brands at lower prices, including numerous private label brands. In addition, our Garden segment operates a sales and logistics network that strategically supports its brands. In fiscal 2018, Garden segment net sales were $874.5 million and operating income was $95.6 million.
Garden Industry Background
The garden industry includes consumables (fertilizer, pesticides, seed, growing media, mulch and products sold in bulk) as well as landscaping products (decorative products such as pottery, wild bird & animal products, water features and lighting) and arches/trellises. We operate primarily in the garden consumables and decorative segments of the industry. Packaged Facts and IBIS estimate that garden consumables, decorative and live plant retail sales were $21.0 billion in 2017.
We believe that gardening is one of the most popular leisure activities in the United States. According to the National Gardening Survey, U.S. households participating in lawn and garden activities is at an all-time high of 77% with participation by 18-34-year-old households also at an all-time high. Participation is highest amongst married households, persons aged 45-64, households with three or more persons; households with children; employed and those persons making $75,000 or more per year. Both the 18-34 and 45-64 demographic participation percentages are projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to remain consistent for the foreseeable future. The 2018 National Gardening Survey also notes that the trends of more people gardening in their yards, container gardening, food gardening and organic gardening are examples of wider interest in a rapidly changing industry. We perceive this market as staying intact and showing slow positive growth.
The lawn and garden market is highly concentrated with most products sold to consumers through a number of distribution channels, including home centers, mass merchants, independent nurseries and hardware stores. Home and garden centers and mass merchants typically carry multiple premium and value brands. Due to the rapid expansion and consolidation of mass merchants and home and garden centers, the concentration of purchasing power for the lawn and garden category has increased dramatically. We expect the growth of home and garden centers, such as Home Depot and Lowe’s, and mass merchants, such as Walmart, to continue to concentrate industry sales. We estimate the retail sales of the lawn and garden supplies and live plant industry, the categories in which we participate, to be approximately $19.7 billion. We believe that the industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slow rate. 
Proprietary Branded Lawn and Garden Products
Our principal lawn and garden product lines are grass seed, wild bird feed, insect control products, lawn and garden care products, including fertilizers, and decorative outdoor patio products. Our Pennington® brand is one of the largest in grass seed, pottery and wild bird feed, and our Amdro® brand is a leading portfolio of control products.
Grass Seed. We are a leading marketer, producer and distributor of numerous varieties and mixtures of cool and warm season grass for both the residential and professional markets, as well as forage and wild game seed mixtures. We sell these products under the Pennington Seed, Pennington, Penkoted®, Max-Q®, ProSelectTM, Tournament Quality CM, MasterTurf®, The Rebels and Smart Seed® brand names. We also produce numerous private label brands of grass seed. The Pennington grass seed manufacturing facilities are some of the largest and most modern seed coating and conditioning facilities in the industry. 
Wild Bird Products. We are the leading marketer, producer and distributor of wild bird feed, bird feeders, bird houses and other birding accessories in the United States. These products are sold primarily under the Pennington brand name. Many of our branded Pennington wild 
8

bird mixes are treated with a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. An example is our Pennington brand mixes which are enriched with Bird-Kote®, our exclusive process which literally seals each seed with a nutritious coating containing vitamins and minerals that are beneficial to the health of wild birds. 
Fertilizers and Controls. We are a leading marketer, producer and distributor of lawn and garden weed, moss, insect and pest control products and soil supplements and stimulants. We sell these products under the AMDRO, Lilly Miller, Moss Out®, Corry’s®, IMAGE®, Sevin®, Over-N-Out®, Rootboost®, Knockout®, and Strike® brand names, as well as private label for Walmart and Lowe's. We manufacture several lines of lawn and garden fertilizers and soil supplements, in granular and liquid form, under the Pennington, Alaska Fish Fertilizer®, Pro Care, and Ironite® brand names and other private and controlled labels. 
Decor. We are a leading marketer and distributor of decorative indoor and outdoor pottery products in the United States. These products, sold under the Pennington name, include terra cotta, stoneware, ceramic and porcelain pots. We also market a complete line of wooden garden products, including planters under the Pennington brand name.
Live Plants. We are the primary supplier of flowers and plants to Home Depot in the mid-Atlantic region. These plants and flowers are sold by Bell Nursery, which we acquired in March 2018.
Garden Sales Network
Our sales and logistics network exists primarily to promote our proprietary brands and provides us with key access to retail stores for our branded products, acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products, immediate exposure for acquired brands and comprehensive and strategic information. The network also sells other manufacturers’ brands of lawn and garden supplies and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments enabling over 4,000 customers to deal with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their lawn and garden supplies requirements.
Garden Sales and Marketing
The marketing strategy for our premium products is focused on meeting consumer needs through product performance, innovation, quality, upscale packaging and retail shelf placement. The marketing strategy for our value products is focused on promotion of the quality and efficacy of our value brands at a lower cost relative to premium brands. Our customers include retailers, such as mass merchants, home improvement centers, independent lawn and garden nurseries, drug and grocery stores, and professional end users. Sales to Walmart represented approximately 29%, 31% and 31%, sales to Lowe’s represented approximately 21%, 21% and 20%, and sales to Home Depot represented approximately 27%, 20% and 19% of our Garden segment’s net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
To maximize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, we market our products through the following four complementary strategies:

• | dedicated sales forces represent our combined brand groups;


• | retail sales and logistics network, which provides in-store training and merchandising for our customers, especially during the prime spring and summer seasons;


• | dedicated account-managers and sales teams located near and dedicated to serve several of our largest customers; and


• | selected independent distributors who sell our brands.

Garden Competition
The lawn and garden products industry is highly competitive. Our lawn and garden products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our turf and forage grass seed products, fertilizers, pesticides and combination products compete principally against products marketed by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (“Scotts”). In addition, Spectrum Brands is a strong competitor in yard and household insecticides. Our Garden segment competes primarily on the basis of its strong premium and value brands, quality, service, price and low-cost manufacturing. Our Garden segment’s sales and logistics operations also compete with a large number of distributors, with competition based on price, service and personal relationships.
Manufacturing
We manufacture the majority of our branded products in 33 manufacturing facilities, located primarily in the United States. In addition, certain of our proprietary branded products are manufactured by contract manufacturers. We have also entered into an exclusive arrangement with a third party to manufacture one of our registered active ingredients, (S)‑Methoprene, for use in that third party’s flea and tick control products.

Purchasing
We purchase most of our raw materials from a number of different suppliers. We purchase one of the raw materials used to manufacture (S)‑Methoprene from a single source of supply. We maintain an inventory of this raw material (in addition to our (S)‑Methoprene inventory) to reduce the possibility of interruption in the availability of (S)‑Methoprene, but a prolonged delay in obtaining (S)‑Methoprene or this raw material could result in a temporary delay in product shipments and have an adverse effect on our Pet segment’s financial results.
The key ingredients in our fertilizer and insect and weed control products are commodity and specialty chemicals, including urea, potash, phosphates, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides.
The principal raw materials required for our wild bird feed operations are bulk commodity grains, including millet, milo and sunflower seeds, which are generally purchased from large national commodity companies and local grain cooperatives. In order to ensure an adequate supply of grains and seed to satisfy expected production volume, we enter into contracts to purchase a portion of our expected grain and seed requirements at future dates by fixing the quantity, and often the price, at the commitment date. Although we have never experienced a severe interruption of supply, we are exposed to price risk with respect to the portion of our supply which is not covered by contracts with a fixed price.
Logistics Network
Our distribution network consists of 55 facilities strategically placed across the United States, one facility in the United Kingdom, one facility in Canada and two facilities in China to allow us to service both our mass market customers as well as our independent specialty retail stores for our branded products. This network also supports distribution of many other manufacturers’ brands and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments, enabling us to serve our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner.
Significant Customers
Walmart, our largest customer, represented approximately 16%, 16% and 15% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Home Depot, our second largest customer, represented approximately 11%, 8% and 8% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, Lowe's, Costco and PetSmart are also significant customers, and together with Walmart and Home Depot, accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 44% in fiscal 2017 and 42% in fiscal 2016. 
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
Our branded products companies hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries and have several patent applications pending. We consider the development of patents through creative research and the maintenance of an active patent program to be advantageous to our business, but do not regard any particular patent as essential to our operations.
In addition to patents, we have numerous active ingredient registrations, end-use product registrations and trade secrets. The success of certain portions of our business, especially our animal health operations, partly depends on our ability to continue to maintain trade secret information which has been licensed to us, and to keep trade secret information confidential.
Along with patents, active ingredient registrations, end use product registrations and trade secrets, we own a number of trademarks, service marks, trade names and logotypes. Many of our trademarks are registered but some are not. We are not aware of any reason we cannot continue to use our trademarks, service marks and trade names in the way that we have been using them.
Employees
As of September 29, 2018, we had approximately 5.400 employees, of whom approximately 4,900 were full-time employees and 500 were temporary or part-time employees. We also hire substantial numbers of additional temporary employees for the peak lawn and garden shipping season of February through June to meet the increased demand experienced during the spring and summer months. The majority of our temporary employees are paid on an hourly basis. Except for approximately 50 employees at a facility in Puebla, Mexico, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Environmental and Regulatory Considerations
Many of the products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Such regulations are often complex and are subject to change. In the United States, all pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), in addition to individual state and/or foreign agency registrations, before they can be sold. Fertilizer products are also subject to state Department of Agriculture registration and foreign labeling regulations. Grass seed is also subject to state, federal and foreign labeling regulations.
10

The Food Quality Protection Act ("FQPA") establishes a standard for food-use pesticides, which is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, which are also used on foods, will be evaluated by the EPA as part of this non-dietary exposure risk assessment.
In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification of individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. We believe we are operating in substantial compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations.
Various federal, state and local laws, including the federal Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), also regulate pet food products and give regulatory authorities the power to recall or require re-labeling of products.  Several new FSMA regulations became effective in recent years.  We believe we are in substantial compliance with all currently effective requirements and are taking steps to ensure that we are in compliance with all regulatory requirements going forward.
Various local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. With our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and most of these facilities have not been subjected to Phase II environmental tests to determine whether they are contaminated.
Environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal. Regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations. Although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and have strict internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products, there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations. However, neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury, property damages or governmental enforcement.
