Our Corporate History and Background
 
My Cloudz, Inc. was incorporated on July 31, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. From our formation on July 31, 2014 until October 9, 2017, we were engaged in the business of cloud storage services. Sommay Vongsa served as President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director from July 31, 2014, until his resignation on October 9, 2017. Concurrent with his resignation, Mr. Vongsa appointed Darren Long, as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chairman of the board of directors, and Secretary; Timothy Orr, as the Company’s new President and a director; and Brian Martinho, as the Company’s new Treasurer and a director.
 
The Company does not have any current plans, arrangements, discussions or intentions, whether written or oral, to engage in a merger or acquisition with an identified or unidentified company or person to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.
 
From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of GridIron BioNutrients, the principal business of cloud storage services.

 Principal Products 
 
 Gridiron BioNutrients principal products currently include: 
 
 Gridiron MVP™ Water Beverage (16.9oz) 
  Gridiron MVP™ Concentrate (2oz / 4oz) 
 
 These products contain a proprietary blend of humic and fulvic acid, trace minerals, probiotics, electrolytes, cannabidiol (CBD) within an alkaline of pH10. 
 
 Gridiron has secured the rights to this proprietary formulation through its CEO, Mr. Long. 
  (VERBAL AGREEMENT). 
 
 Gridiron has the exclusive right(s) to develop CBD products with this formulation. However, Gridiron is limited to developing only CBD products with this formulation and as such does not have any rights to develop products that do not contain CBD with this formulation. 
 
 In addition to the Gridiron MVP™ beverage and concentrate Gridiron currently has the following products available to market: 
 
 Gridiron Salve 
  Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Drops (1oz /2oz) 
  Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Capsules 
 
 Gridiron executed a 1 month “trial period” Manufacture Distribution Agreement on September 22, 2017 with a manufacturer of high quality CBD for the above mentioned products. The Distribution Agreement allows Gridiron to “White Label” (market and distribute) on a non-exclusive basis the above products under the Gridiron name. The Company anticipates executing a long term Manufacture Agreement with this Company or a similar Company within the next three months. 
 Distribution of Products 
 
 Gridiron’s products are currently available for sale on its website http://gridironbionutrients.com. The Company intends to retain a consultant(s) to provide avenues to distribution its products within the next twelve months. However, in order to retain any consultant(s) the Company will require funding and currently the Company does not have the required funding to accomplish this task. If the Company is unable to secure financing; it would likely result in a material loss of any investment made into the Company. 
 Competition 
 
 Competition within the Cannabidiol (CBD) industry is intense with many well established Companies within the market and numerous start-up companies entering the market. Gridiron intends to brand and market high quality CBD products through both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that will serve to make the Company a market leader. 
 
 In addition to the products described herein the Company intends to add an additional CBD water beverage to its product line within the next 4-5 months. The Company can provide no assurance or guarantee that it will be able to develop and/or maintain any strategic alliances now or in the future or that its anticipated new CBD beverage will be accepted by the market if and when developed. If the Company cannot develop and maintain strategic alliances or be successful with the offer of its CBD products and proposed CBD products it would be a significant material negative impact on the business that could result in a significant loss to any investment made into the Company.

 Sources of Raw Materials 
 
 Gridiron MVP™ product(s) contain proprietary blend of nutrients that are sourced from various third parties and formulated into the water beverage and concentrate. If for any reason any of these sources are disrupted and the Company is unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to formulate the Gridiron MVP™ product(s) it would materially impact the business that may result in significant losses. Moreover, the Company will be dependent upon third party bottling facilities for its Gridiron MVP™ product; currently the Company has no arrangements or otherwise with any bottling facility and cannot provide any assurance that a suitable bottling facility can be retained or maintained in the future. 
 
 The Company currently has a Distribution place for the Gridiron Salve, Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Drops (1oz /2oz) and Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Capsules. If there is a disruption with the manufacturer of these products for any reason with the Company it could result in significant delays and/or the inability to deliver the products to customers which would negatively impact the Company’s business.
