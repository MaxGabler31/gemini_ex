Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on September 14, 2017 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We are an investment vehicle of Carlyle International Energy Partners, L.P. (CIEP). 
 Carlyle operates one of the largest and most diversified Energy and Natural Resource alternative investment platforms in the world, with more than $27 billion in assets under management and 95 active portfolio companies focused across five distinct investment disciplines: International Energy (CIEP), North American Energy, North American Power, Global Infrastructure and Energy Mezzanine (collectively the Carlyle Energy Platform). 
 CIEP is Carlyles primary vehicle for international energy investing. The CIEP investment team includes 14 investment professionals who collectively bring more than 230 years of experience investing and operating energy businesses across CIEPs targeted markets. CIEP currently holds or is committed to acquire a diversified portfolio of upstream, midstream and downstream assets spread across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. The CIEP investment team led by Marcel Q. H. van Poecke (the CIEP International Energy Investment Team) is actively investing CIEP, a $2.5 billion fund, which had a 29% gross internal rate of return as of December 31, 2018. The CIEP International Energy Investment Team is primarily based in London. 
 We are led by Mr. van Poecke, Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Brooke B. Coburn, our President. Mr. van Poecke is both the Head of the CIEP International Energy Investment Team and the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. van Poecke has more than 25 years of experience in the Energy sector, primarily as an entrepreneur, investor and executive manager. Mr. van Poecke is also the Chairman of Atlaslnvest group, a private holding and investment group. Mr. Coburn joined The Carlyle Group in 1996 and is currently a Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer of Carlyles Energy and Natural Resources Platform and Co-Head of Carlyle Growth Partners and Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund, the US Middle Market Buyout and Growth Capital activities of The Carlyle Group. Mr. Coburn is also a member of the CIEP Investment Committee. None of CIEP, the CIEP International Energy Investment Team or the CIEP Investment Committee presently, other than our directors and officers, has any arrangement with, obligations or duties to us. For further information, please see Conflicts of Interest. 
 In addition to the deep experience and capabilities of the CIEP International Energy Investment Team, CIEP also benefits from close coordination with the four other global energy investing disciplines that collectively constitute the Carlyle Energy Platform. A central objective of the Carlyle Energy Platform is to actively leverage deal flow, market intelligence, operating expertise, and other industry insights and capabilities across the different markets where Carlyle operates. Given the interconnected nature of global energy markets, where developments in one country or region can heavily impact commodity supply, demand and pricing in distant regions, Carlyle believes the scale and diversification of Carlyles integrated global platform provides it with valuable insights to inform its investing activities and create competitive advantages. 
 In addition to the Carlyle Energy Platform, CIEP also benefits from access to broader capabilities inherent in the Carlyle global investment platform (which we refer to as the One Carlyle capabilities) including: 
 

 | Global market capabilities resulting from 31 offices across six continents, led by local investment professionals with deep familiarity of local markets and language skills;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Industry insights from more than 637 investment professionals with deep sector expertise;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
1 


 
 | Portfolio company operational improvement capabilities deriving from more than 26 seasoned operating executives with experience helping Carlyle to accelerate growth and profitability. Additionally, Carlyle portfolio companies have the ability to access the firms Leveraged Purchasing Forum, which leverages the firms scale and scope to drive best practices and procurement discounts across various functional areas; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Carlyle is one of the largest private equity issuers of deal related debt globally, with an average of $30 billion in loan and bond issuance annually. The Carlyle Global Capital Markets team ensures the direct management of the syndication and placement of Carlyles paper, helping us achieve best in class terms and market execution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the deep expertise of the CIEP International Energy Investment Team, combined with additional leverage from the Carlyle Energy Platform and the firms broader One Carlyle capabilities afford our management team distinct advantages in identifying an appropriate target company and driving future value creation. 
 We intend to generate superior capital appreciation through a focus on international energy opportunities where a hands-on operationally focused transformational investment thesis can be pursued. Specifically, we will seek to invest in fundamentally sound businesses that are underperforming their potential and could significantly benefit from our knowledge and operational experience in the international energy arena. We believe the CIEP International Energy Investment Team has the capability to deliver enhanced risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through a variety of means, including, but not limited to, utilization of technical expertise, superior evaluation of project returns and better cost controls. Furthermore, we will evaluate opportunities to identify investments where we can effect an outsized positive transformation or augmentation of existing business or properties to maximize their overall value proposition to our shareholders. 
 We will seek to capitalize on the experience and expertise of the Investment Committee of CIEP, which includes William E. Conway, Jr., Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, Daniel A. DAniello, Co-Founder and Chairman of The Carlyle Group, Glenn Youngkin, President and Chief Operating Officer of The Carlyle Group, Andrew Marino, Managing Director, and Brooke B. Coburn, Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer of The Carlyle Groups Energy and Natural Resources platform, and Co-Head of Carlyle Growth Partners and Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund, all of whom have extensive experience making energy investments together at The Carlyle Group over the past ten years. Kenneth Hersh, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NGP Energy Capital Management, an international energy investor with a strong track record of successful energy investments, is also a member of the Investment Committee and brings over 25 years of experience to CIEP. 
 In addition, we believe our ability to complete an initial business combination will be enhanced by our having entered into the forward purchase agreement pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to purchase up to 25,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, plus up to 8,333,333 warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $250,000,000 in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Our sponsor will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed by us and our sponsor to be retained by the post-business combination company for working capital or other purposes. These purchases will be made regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders in connection with our initial business combination and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the international energy sector, including any of the upstream, midstream, downstream or service sectors of the oil and gas industry that complements the 
 
2 


  experience of our management team and can benefit from our management teams operational expertise. Our acquisition strategy leverages our teams network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the energy industry could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties to improve their overall value proposition. 
 We believe that subsectors within the energy market are driven by global macro trends including economic growth and industrialization, which create increased global demand for hydrocarbons, energy infrastructure and supporting services. We believe that the focus of many investors on unconventional energy projects in North America has led to a dearth of capital for energy projects in the rest of the world, which will lead to attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities internationally. In addition, the following factors are contributing to increased international opportunities: 
 

 | over 70% of required oil and gas investments are made outside of the US, but over two thirds of capital raising has occurred in the US;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | growing geographical mismatch between the location of oil and natural gas resources and main demand centers is set to drive an expansion of international trade;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a significant number of the lowest cost production basins are outside the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | limited access to debt and equity capital for energy projects outside the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we believe that recent upstream project deferrals and cancellations should accelerate global oil production decline rates and create future supply shortages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a number of energy companies announcing plans to divest non-core operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | commodity revaluation since 2014 and tightened international capital markets conditions have caused market dislocation which has created a favorable buying opportunity where financially strong buyers, not reliant on high leverage, are well-placed;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | consensus on oil price forecasts now exists between asset buyers and sellers after the precipitous price drop in 2014 and 2015;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | meeting the required growth in global energy supply requires significant investment, not only in sub-surface resources, but also in above ground infrastructure including investments in pipeline, storage terminals, refining, LNG and generation infrastructure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | distressed situations within the oil field services sector leading to opportunities at attractive valuations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the primary regions of energy demand growth are all outside the United States due to growing demand in the developing world.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While pursuing an initial business combination and subsequent transactions, we plan to utilize the network and industry experience of CIEP and the CIEP International Energy Investment Team. Over the course of their careers, the members of the CIEP International Energy Investment Team, the Investment Committee and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through both the CIEP International Energy Investment Team and the Investment Committees extensive experience in both investing in and operating in the energy industry. 
 We will derive substantial benefit from our sponsors association with a large and diversified global firm. As an investment vehicle of CIEP, we will draw upon the full resources and institutional infrastructure of The Carlyle Group, which consists of over 625 investment advisory professionals, operating out of 31 offices spread across six continents. 
 
3 


 We believe the CIEP International Energy Investment Teams capabilities and expertise will allow us to efficiently evaluate opportunities and select only those where the CIEP International Energy Investment Team can add significant value through their operational expertise, which should allow us to invest opportunistically across the energy value chain. We will rely on the CIEP International Energy Investment Teams past investment and operating experience investing in upstream, midstream, downstream and service companies. 
 Acquisition Strategy 
 Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses or asset portfolios that we believe: 

 | can utilize the extensive networks and insights the CIEP International Energy Investment Team has built in the international energy arena;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are fundamentally sound but are underperforming their potential as a result of underinvestment, lack of strategic focus and operational dis-synergies in the current commodity price environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | exhibit unrecognized value, desirable re-investment opportunities, and a need for capital to achieve the targets development strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will seek to acquire the target on terms and in a manner that leverages our management teams experience investing within the energy industry. Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified risks. 
 The CIEP International Energy Investment Team has seen a significant number of larger target opportunities recently. One such transaction that CIEP was involved in was its $3.9 billion acquisition of Neptune Energy Group, a global exploration and production business focused on North West Europe and with operations in North Africa and South East Asia (closing occurred in the first quarter of 2018). In addition, CIEP has built several additional large-scale portfolio companies that span the energy value chain across the globe, including upstream company Assala Energy (60kbpd operated production in Gabon; closing occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017), midstream company HES International (1.45mmcbm storage capacity across Europe), and downstream company Varo Energy (165kbpd refining capacity in North West Europe). 
 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.

 Significant Activities Since Inception 
 On December 5, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering of 30,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-third of one warrant, to purchase one Class A ordinary share. Each whole public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $300,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the sale of the units, we consummated the private placement of 5,333,333 warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, issued to our sponsor, generating total proceeds of $8,000,000. 
 Approximately $300 million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants to our sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders. 
 In addition, on December 5, 2017, we entered into the forward purchase agreement pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to purchase up to 25,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, plus up to 8,333,333 warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $250,000,000 in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. 
 Our units began trading on December 1, 2017 on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RWGE.U. Commencing on January 22, 2018, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The ordinary shares, and warrants are trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols RWGE and RWGE WS, respectively. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (net of amounts previously disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new ordinary or preference shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in order to consummate such transaction. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSEs 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

 Conflicts of Interest 
 Carlyle manages several Carlyle Funds. Further, members of our management team are employed by Carlyle or have fiduciary and contractual obligations to other entities that may or may not be affiliated with Carlyle. The Carlyle Funds and such other entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If the Carlyle Funds or such entities decide to pursue and are successful in procuring any such acquisition opportunity, such opportunity could become unavailable to us. In addition, investment ideas generated within Carlyle may be suitable for both us and for a current or future Carlyle Fund, including CIEP, and may be directed to such Carlyle investment vehicle rather than to us. Carlyle does not have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which it becomes aware. Any presentation of such opportunities to CIEP may present additional conflicts, given CIEPs significant investment in us and the overlap between members of the management team and CIEP International Energy Investment Team. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity, including CIEP. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any business opportunity offered to any of our officers or directors shall be presented to the company only to the extent that such business opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer and such opportunity is one we are permitted to complete on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, business combination opportunities presented to our officers or directors in the context of their positions with any other entity, including CIEP, to which they have fiduciary or contractual obligations will in any event be deemed presented to him or her in his or her capacity as a representative of such other entity. Further, CIEP, members of our management team and our CIEP-related directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, for these reasons, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. 
 We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation, which we refer to as an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a future issuance of equity or equity-linked securities to any such entity. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 
6 


 While we believe that our structure and our management teams backgrounds and experience will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination as of December 31, 2018 in the amount of $294,842,146, after payment of $10,500,000 of deferred underwriting discounts and before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
 In addition, we believe our ability to complete an initial business combination will be enhanced by our having entered into the forward purchase agreement pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to purchase up to 25,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, plus up to 8,333,333 warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $250,000,000 in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. 
 Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 In addition to the forward purchase agreement, we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the forward purchase agreement, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. 
 These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus relating to our initial public offering or reports we file with the SEC and know what types of businesses we are 
 
7 


  targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finders fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finders fee, consulting fee, or other compensation for introducing a target business to us. We agreed to reimburse our sponsor up to a total of up to $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor, officers and directors for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors or other Carlyle funds. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity and he or she has fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, including CIEP, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have and may in the future have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any business opportunity offered to any of our officers or directors shall be presented to the company only to the extent that such business opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer and such opportunity is one we are permitted to complete on a reasonable basis. We may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a future issuance to any such entity. 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
 Under the NYSEs listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 


 
 | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest earned on the trust account (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding if the warrants are surrendered to the company or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which it agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and any public shares it may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after our initial public offering. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. 
 
11 


 If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of our initial business combination. 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our sponsor agreed to vote its founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our sponsors founder shares, we would need 11,250,000, or 37.5%, of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote, or how they vote on, the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which it agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. The other members of our management team entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after our initial public offering. 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete our initial business combination. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares 
 
12 


  sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with Exercising Redemption Rights 
 In connection with any vote held to approve a proposed business combination, public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right 
 
13 


  to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors in all cases subject to and the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period. 
 Our sponsor entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which it has waived its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor or management team acquire public shares on the open market after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any officer or director, or any other person. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account plus the interest earned on the funds in the trust account available to us, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. If those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a 
 
14 


  waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. We believe our sponsors only assets are securities of the company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,000,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby 
 
15 


  exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Facilities 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Suite 220 South, Washington, D.C. 20004. The cost for our use of this space is included in the up to $20,000 per month fee we pay to our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain audited financial statements and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
16 


 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2011 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 30 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
