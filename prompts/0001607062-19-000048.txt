ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
International Baler Corp. was incorporated on September 10, 1975, in the State of Delaware under the name B.W. Energy Systems, Inc. Its name was changed to Waste Technology Corp. in August 1983. In March 2009, Waste Technology Corporation’s wholly-owned subsidiary, International Baler Corporation (IBC), was merged into Waste Technology Corporation and the Company changed its name to International Baler Corporation. International Baler Corporation maintains its executive offices and manufacturing facilities at 5400 Rio Grande Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida 32254. The Company’s telephone number is (904) 358-3812. The Company's fiscal year end is October 31.
 
General
 
The Company is a manufacturer of baling equipment which is fabricated from steel and utilizes hydraulic and electrical components to compress a variety of materials into bales for easier handling, shipping, disposal, storage, and for recycling. Materials commonly baled include scrap metal, corrugated boxes, newsprint, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and other solid waste. More sophisticated applications include baling of textile materials, fibers and synthetic rubber. The Company offers a wide variety of balers, standard models, as well as custom models to meet specific customer requirements.
Products
 
Balers utilize mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical mechanisms to compress a variety of materials into bales for easier and lower cost handling, shipping, disposal, storage, and/or bulk sales for recycling. The Company offers a wide variety of balers, certain types that are standardized and others that are designed to specific customer requirements. The Company's products include (i) general purpose horizontal and vertical balers, (ii) specialty balers, such as those used for textile materials, used clothing, aluminum cans, 55-gallon drums and synthetic rubber; and (iii) accessory equipment such as conveyors, fluffers, bale tying machines, and plastic bottle piercers (machines which puncture plastic bottles before compaction for greater density).The Company also provides service and repair work to general purpose and specialty balers.
General Purpose Balers
 
These balers are designed for general purpose compaction of waste materials. They are manufactured in either vertical or horizontal loading models, depending on available floor space and desired capacity. Typical materials that are handled by this equipment include paper, corrugated boxes, and miscellaneous solid waste materials. These balers range in bale weight capacity from approximately 300 to 3,000 pounds and range in price from approximately $5,000 to $600,000. General purpose baler sales constituted approximately 61% and 58% of net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Specialty Balers
 
Specialty balers are designed for specific applications which require modifications of the general baler configuration. The rubber baler is designed to apply pressure in such a way as to compress the synthetic rubber into a self-contained bale that does not require tying. The scrap metal baler is designed to form a bale, referred to as a scrap metal "briquette" of specified size and weight. The drum crusher baler is capable of collapsing a standard 55-gallon drum into a "pancake" approximately four (4) to eight (8) inches high, which also serves to contain any remaining contents. The textile baler is capable of compressing and baling loose fibers, which do not ordinarily adhere to each other under pressure. In addition, a double chamber baler has been designed for use by the clothing and textile industries.
 
Specialty balers range in price from approximately $5,000 to $550,000, and are less exposed to competitive pressures than are general purpose balers. Specialty baler sales constituted approximately 7% and 15% of net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Accessory Equipment
 
The Company manufactures and markets a number of accessory equipment items in order to market a complete waste handling system. This equipment includes conveyors, which carry waste from floor level to the top of large horizontal balers; extended hoppers on such balers; rufflers, which break up material to improve bale compaction; electronic start/stop controls and hydraulic oil coolers and cleaners. For 2018 and 2017, accessory equipment did not represent a significant percentage of net sales.
Warranties and Service
 
IBC typically warranties its products for one year from the date of sale as to materials, three (3) years for structural damage, and six months as to labor, and offers services for other required repairs and maintenance. Service is rendered by repairing or replacing parts at IBC's Jacksonville, Florida, facility, and by on-site service provided by Company personnel who are based in Jacksonville, Florida, or by local service agents who are engaged as needed. Repair services and spare parts sales represented approximately  27% and 25% of the Company’s net sales for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Manufacturing
 
The Company manufactures its products in its facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where it maintains a fully equipped and staffed manufacturing plant. IBC purchases raw materials, such as steel sheets and beams and components such as hydraulic pumps, valves and cylinders, and certain controls and other electric equipment which are used in the fabrication of the balers. The Company has no long-term supply agreements, and has not experienced unusual delays in obtaining raw materials or components.
 
The raw materials required by IBC to manufacture the balers, principally steel, motors, and hydraulic systems, are readily available from a number of sources and IBC is not dependent on any particular source. IBC is not dependent on any significant patents, trademarks, licenses, or franchises in connection with its manufacture of balers.
 
While IBC maintains an inventory of raw materials, most of it is intended for specific orders and inventory turnover is relatively rapid. Approximately 60% of its inventory turns over in 45 to 90 days and the remaining balance, consisting of customized equipment, turns over in 3 to 6 months. IBC's business is not seasonal.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
IBC sells its products throughout the United States and to some extent in Europe, the Far East, and South America to manufacturers of synthetic rubber and polymers, plastic recycling facilities, power generating facilities, textile mills, paper mills, cotton gins, supermarkets and other retail outlets, paper recycling facilities, and municipalities.
 
IBC has a sales force of three (3) employees who rely upon responses to advertising, personal visits, attendance at trade shows, referrals from existing customers and telephone calls to dealers and/or end users. Approximately 45% of sales are made through manufacturer's representatives and dealers. Sales made through the Company’s dealers are generally discounted and sales are recorded net of the discount amount. Occasionally sales are made with a commission payment, selling expense, through a representative who is not a dealer.

The Company's general purpose balers are sold throughout the United States to such end users as waste producing retailers, manufacturing and fabricating plants, bulk material producers, and solid waste recycling facilities. Specialty balers are sold worldwide, including Europe, the Far East, and South America to manufacturers of rubber and polymers, plastic recycling facilities, paper recycling facilities, textile mills and power generating facilities. During fiscal 2018, foreign sales amounted to $687,407 or approximately 6% of the Company’s net sales while in fiscal 2017, foreign sales amounted to $2,077,036, approximately 19% of the Company’s net sales. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company had no significant sales to any one foreign country.
 
During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, IBC had sales to more than 300 customers. In fiscal 2018, three customers accounted for 11.8%, 11.2% and 9.0% of total net sales, respectively, while in fiscal 2017, three customers accounted for 17.9%, 11.4% and 8.0% of net sales, respectively.
 
The Company builds only a small quantity of balers for its inventory and generally builds based on firm sales orders. The Company's open sales orders at October 31, 2018 were $2,300,000 and at October 31, 2017 were $3,450,000. The Company generally delivers its orders within four (4) months of the date booked.
 
Competition
 
The potential market for the Company's balers is nationwide and overseas, but the majority of the Company’s general purpose baler sales are in the United States. The Company competes in these markets with approximately 20 companies, none of which are believed to be dominant, but some of which may have significantly greater sales and financial resources than the Company. The Company is able to compete with these companies due to its reputation in the market place, its ability to service the balers it manufactures and sells, as well as its ability to custom design balers to a customer's particular needs. The Company experiences intense competition with respect to its lower priced or general purpose balers, based upon price, including freight, and based on performance. The Company experiences less competition with respect to its specialized baler equipment, such as synthetic rubber, scrap metal, and textile balers.
Regulation
 
Machinery, such as the Company's balers, is subject to both federal and state regulation relating to safe design and operation. The Company complies with design requirements and its balers include interlocks to prevent operation while the loading door is open, and also includes required printed safety warnings.
Research and Development
 
The Company has the broadest line of products in the baler industry and continues to provide its customers with new products and product improvements. The Company invests a minimal amount on general research and development of new products.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
The Company generally believes that it has complied with and is in compliance, with all federal, state, and local environmental laws.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2018, the Company employed 57 full-time employees as follows: 4 in management and supervision: 9 in sales and service; 34 in manufacturing; 6 in engineering; and, 4 in administration.
