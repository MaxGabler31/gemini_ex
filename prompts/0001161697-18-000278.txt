History

The Company was formed as RX Scripted, LLC on December 30, 2004 as a North Carolina limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation as RX Scripted, Inc. on December 5, 2007.

On or around January 7, 2010 the Company’s name was changed to MedCareers Group, Inc. Additionally, as a result of filing the Certificate, the Company’s symbol on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board changed to “MCGI”, effective January 7, 2010.

On or around November 19, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with Nurses Lounge, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Nurses Lounge”) and the nine shareholders of Nurses Lounge (the “Nurses Lounge Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Exchange, we agreed to issue 24,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the Nurses Lounge Shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nurses Lounge. Although 24,000,000 restricted shares were issued in connection with the Exchange, certain significant shareholders of the Company also agreed to cancel some of the shares they owned so that the net effect of the Exchange was an increase to the outstanding shares by 7,175,000 shares rather than 24,000,000. Included in the shareholders receiving shares in connection with the Exchange, was Timothy Armes founder and president of Nurses Lounge, Inc., who received 14,902,795 shares.

Pursuant to the Exchange, Nurses Lounge, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and as a result of the Exchange, the Cancellation Agreements and the Voting Agreement, Timothy Armes, the former largest shareholder of Nurses Lounge obtained majority voting control over the Company; provided that effective upon the expiration of the Voting Agreement in November 2012, Mr. Armes is no longer our majority shareholder.

Effective September 10, 2011, Timothy Armes, the Company’s then majority shareholder was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director of the Company.

 History and Description of the Operations of Nurses Lounge

At the beginning of 2003 in Dallas, Texas, Timothy Armes took over control of the nursing Internet portal and nursing job board NursesLounge.com and re-launched the web site shortly thereafter. Mr. Armes also launched a localized direct mail magazine as a companion to the website. Years of managing a portal and publishing a monthly magazine gave Mr. Armes insight to numerous organizations in need of a more efficient way to communicate important information to nursing professionals such as news, meetings and continuing education requirements on a timely basis.

With this understanding, and the development of social media technology, Mr. Armes designed and launched a beta version of a professional network for nurses in the summer of 2009 designed to provide a common platform for nursing organizations such as nursing schools, associations and major nurse employers to connect and communicate more effectively to their nurse constituents and broader nursing profession.

In June of 2014 Nurses Lounge began the development of a 2.0 version of the network. The new version was a complete upgrade that went into beta testing on August 1, 2014 and then live on September 2, 2014. With the completion of this upgrade Nurses Lounge functions as a true Professional Network for Nurses (or comparatively a Linkedin for Nurses). Like Linkedin, when a nurse joins they can create an online professional profile and invite colleagues to join their online professional network.

With the added capabilities of the new network, the new version was launched with an “Interactive Lounge” (comparable to a group on Linkedin or Facebook) for approximately 600 schools that offer a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), 1,000 nursing schools that offer an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN), 6,000 medical facilities, plus interactive lounges for 97 nurse specialties. Representatives from these organizations can take administrative control of these lounge pages, customize their pages with images, logos, and videos, as well as the ability to post news and info that is instantly distributed to their nurse followers.

There is no cost to schools, associations or other non-profit organizations to utilize the Nurses Lounge communication and networking capabilities while employers, and other for profit organizations, are charged minimal set-up fees that also may include unlimited job postings for a limited time.

As members of the Nurses Lounge, nurses are able to participate in groups created by organizations such as schools, associations and employers in order to keep current on news, information, meetings and jobs openings as well as to network professionally with like-minded colleagues. Participation and postings by members in Lounges creates new connections and makes it easier for people to find and connect with each other. Finally, by inviting new colleagues and contacts to join them in the Nurses Lounge, members both grow their own network of connections and help to increase membership in Nurses Lounge.

Along with the professional network, Nurses Lounge has a fully functional job board for nursing professionals as well as a nursing faculty for nursing schools looking to hire faculty.

Nurses Lounge expects to generate a substantial percentage of revenue from the job board and, as nurse membership grows, expects to generate additional revenue from targeted ads and email campaigns both from employers and nursing schools looking to fill online classes as well as continuing education offerings.

Over the last year we have concentrated our efforts into re-launching the employer area of our network into a talent acquisition platform for hiring nurses as well as the launch of a searchable degree program directory.

Along with the talent acquisition platform, we have included what we believe to be the first nurses only map oriented job search. This allows nurses the potential to see hundreds of jobs available them within a geographic radius. By clicking on a pin on the job map they can view and apply for jobs at that specific location.

The degree program directory, targeted to 4 year BSN schools, has 26 degree categories to search such as online RN to BSN programs as well as various PhD programs. We do not charge schools for posting their programs in the directory. However, we do request that they place our social link on their web site and invite their students and alumni to follow them in the Nurses Lounge.

Additionally, we plan to be current with all required filings including the January 31, 2018 Form 10-K. With the completion of this process coming to a close, we are presently looking at various strategic options to enhance shareholder value, including the option of selling our subsidiary, which could relieve the Company of much of its debt.

 Competition

While there are various online community forums and nurse portals, Nurses Lounge does not believe that there is a direct competitor designed from the ground up as a professional network for nurses and to solve many of the day-to-day communications problems nursing organizations have. The largest competitors of Nurses Lounge bill themselves as “communities” that claim to provide news, career advice and social interaction, and include Nurse.com - owned by OnCourse Learning (purchase from Gannet in 2014) and Allnurses – a nursing forum and discussion board. Additionally, and to a lesser extent, Nurses Lounge indirectly competes with other websites that encourage users to create connections with other colleagues and persons with similar interests such as Linkedin and Facebook, however, unlike like these websites which have very broad general appeal, Nurses Lounge focuses solely on the nursing pro and the organizations which support them.
Proprietary Rights

We plan to rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights moving forward. There can be no assurance that the steps we plan to take in the future to protect our future proprietary rights, however, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Although we believe that our websites and services will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize our intellectual property, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant sums on litigation, pay damages, delay our products and software, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that are the subject of any such infringement. Therefore, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our planned business, operating results and financial condition.
Nursing Profession Overview

From Nurses Lounge business viewpoint, the nursing profession is broken down into the individual registered nurses (RNs) and the professions stake holder organizations consisting of nursing schools, associations and employers.

Throughout their career, nurses need to be connected with numerous organizations in order to simply stay up to date with basic continuing education requirements which they need to meet state guidelines and/or employers qualification to maintain employment.

As such, we believe that there is an opportunity to unite the industry on one simple to use communication platform that can upgrade, simplify and reduce the cost of communications used by stakeholder organizations while providing nurses quick access to the information important to their careers. The market for nurses is growing in the United States and we believe that our website has a significant number of potential users based on the following:


• | According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Projections 2012-2022 released in December 2013, Registered Nursing (RN) is listed among the top occupations in terms of job growth through 2022. The RN workforce is expected to grow from 2.71 million in 2012 to 3.24 million in 2022, an increase of 526,800 or 19%. The Bureau also projects the need for 525,000 replacements nurses in the workforce bringing the total number of job openings for nurses due to growth and replacements to 1.05 million by 2022.
• | According to a 2013 survey conducted by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing and The Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers, 55% of the RN workforce is age 50 or older. 
• | Approximately 700 schools offer a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and other advanced degrees such as Masters and PhD. 
• | Approximately 2,500 community college type schools offer a 2 year Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN). 
• | Approximately 6,000 hospitals are located across the U.S. where approximately 60% of all nurses are employed, according to American Association Colleges of Nursing (AACN).
