Overview 
 
We design and cause to be designed advanced zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems for integration in new school buses and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. We also design and cause to be designed patented conversion kits to replace conventional drivetrain systems for combustion powered vehicles with zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain systems. The hybrid drivetrain systems are available in both an assistive hybrid format and a full-traction format for use in private and commercial fleet vehicles of all sizes. We expect to expand our product offerings to include the sale of zero-emission systems in vehicles manufactured by outside original equipment manufacture (OEM) partners, can be marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through our developing distribution and service network.
 
Our drivetrain systems can be built with optional telemetrics for remote monitoring, electric power-export and various levels of grid-connectivity. Our zero-emission systems may also grow to include automated charging infrastructure and “intelligent” stationary energy storage that enables fast vehicle charging, emergency back-up facility power, and access to the developing, grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs.
 
We are a provider of new zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles and replacement drivetrains focused on total cost of ownership. Our drivetrain systems are designed to help fleet operators unlock the benefits of green technology and address the challenges of local, state and federal regulatory compliance and traditional-fuel price cost instability.
 
We generated virtually no revenue from inception through December 31, 2016, and generated $425,000 of revenue in 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net losses were $21.9 million, $10.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
 
On January 9, 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,666,667 units for aggregate gross proceeds of $11.0 million. For each unit sold in the offering, we issued one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 1.5 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.50. Net proceeds received after deducting commissions, expenses and fees of approximately $1.2 million were approximately $9.8 million. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, the proceeds from our offering under Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) of $12.6 million, net of payments to selling stockholders of approximately $1.7 million, when combined with the follow-on raise discussed above is a total of approximately $23.6 million, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $19.8 million
 
Market Overview
 
Concerns regarding climate change and other environmental considerations have led to the implementation of laws and regulations that restrict, cap, or tax emissions in the automotive industry and throughout other industries. In particular, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 emission standards, California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations, and recently implemented policies in Europe, generally referred to as Stage I, II, III and IV regulations, require a significant reduction in the level of emissions and particulate matter produced by diesel power systems and are increasing the costs associated with producing carbon-intensive fuels. These regulations are expected to increase both the cost and size of emission-compliant diesel power products, primarily due to the need to incorporate additional combustion and after-treatment components.
 
A variety of market factors are contributing to the increased use of alternative fuels and growth of alternative fuel technology, including economics, energy independence, environmental concerns, and the widespread availability of alternative fuels. As the price of crude oil remains volatile and the threats of climate change and air pollution remain public concerns, we believe the search for more cost effective and cleaner fuels has become more important. Electricity has emerged as a cleaner-fuel solution to these challenges. The price of alternative fuels such as electricity is often substantially less than diesel or gasoline, and alternative fuels can result in the production of lower amounts of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.

In 2016, the number of electric cars surpassed two million in cumulative global car stock to date after reaching one million in cumulative global car stock in September 2015, up from about 665,000 as of the end of 2014. Additionally, in 2016, the number of electric buses grew to approximately 345,000 vehicles, double the number on the road in 2015 and an increase from 46,000 in 2014. Despite significant increases, including global sales of over 750,000 electric cars in 2016, electric vehicles (EVs) still represent only approximately 0.2% of the total number of passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation as of June 2017 and the EV market share exceeds 1% of total car sales in only six countries: the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and China, with Norway leading with a 29% market share. Further, while the United States accounted for the largest portion of the global stock of electric cars in 2015 and accounted for approximately 20% of all new EVs sold worldwide in 2016, in 2016, China surpassed the United States, accounting for approximately 45% of all new EVs sold worldwide.
 
In the United States, sales of new EVs increased by 37% in 2016 as compared to 2015, and more than half of such sales occurred in California, likely driven by the state’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, buy-down and grants for EVs which require that a certain percentage of an automobile manufacturer’s sales must be zero-emission vehicles.
 
By 2019, global sales of EVs are estimated to exceed two million units, which would represent an increase from the 549,000 units sold in 2015, and by 2020, the global stock of electric cars may range between 9 million and 20 million. Further, in North America, some estimates suggest that the annual sales of hybrid and electric buses and trucks may increase 20.5% and 30.9% year-over-year through 2025, respectively. It is estimated that China has more than 200 million electric two-wheelers, between three and four million low-speed EVs and more than 300,000 electric buses in 2017, up from more than 170,000 and 112,400 buses in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and continues to seek electrification of other modes of transportation. Additionally, the output of the special purpose vehicle market in China increased 10.7 times year-over-year to 47,800 in 2015, and in the first two months of 2016, increased by approximately 116%. In September 2017, China announced that it intends to compel automobile manufacturers to accelerate the production of EVs by 2019, suggesting a concerted effort by the government of China to phase out traditional internal combustion engines as soon as practicable.
 
The overall market for EVs consists of multiple, discrete markets for various vehicle types, including passenger cars, buses, two-wheelers and others. Passenger cars are the most prominent, but two-wheelers are far more prevalent, particularly in Asia, and buses and trucks, although smaller in number are significantly higher in price and often purchased in bulk by major corporate customers or government or transit agencies. Because light duty passenger vehicles represent the largest potential market and have received the most attention from both analysts and policymakers, most global forecasts look at light duty EV sales.
 
Charging infrastructure is another important factor in EV adoption rates. The United States currently has 12,845 public electric charging stations and 32,069 public charging outlets. Some areas have considerably more charging stations than others, contributing to greater EV usage in those regions. Examples of particularly well equipped areas include the East and West Coasts of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe.
 
Electric Vehicle Markets
 
EVs include those that plug in to sources of electricity to recharge, such as: plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and pure electric battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as well as simple hybrid vehicles that combine a conventional powertrain with some kind of electric propulsion. Electric motors all share simple mechanics and high energy conversion efficiency, which can reach 90% over a range of speeds and power outputs. Especially in start-stop city driving, regenerative braking can help convert motive energy back into electricity and reduce wear on brakes. Electric motors can also provide high torque from rest and do not need multiple gears to match power curves, obviating the need for gearboxes and torque converters.

Passenger Vehicles
 
Total worldwide sales of passenger EVs only surpassed two million in 2016. Despite recent growth, this still represents only 10% of the multi-nation Electric Vehicles Initiative’s goal of 20 million passenger EVs on the roads by 2020, or 2% of global cars.
 
In 2015, sales of plug-in EVs (including both pure plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and PHEVs, light trucks in the United States and Canada and light commercial vehicles in Europe) significantly increased. Global sales reached almost 540,000, a nearly 70% increase from 2014, which itself saw an approximate 50% increase from 2013. Notwithstanding this positive trend, EVs still comprised only 0.86% of the global auto market in 2016. In 2016, sales of plug-in EVs (including both pure PEVs and PHEVs, light trucks in the United States and Canada and light commercial vehicles in Europe) increased further to 773,600, a 42% increase from 2015.
 
Regionally, the largest increase occurred in China, which more than tripled EV sales in 2015 and accounted for more than 40% of the electric cars sold globally in 2016, more than double the amount sold in the United States, followed by Europe and the United States. Globally, approximately 95% of electric car sales occur in just ten countries: China, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. China and Europe, in particular, have been able to accelerate sales growth, likely due to stronger government support, particularly in the form of rebates, tax abatements, and other financial incentives for purchasing EVs.
 
Commercial Vehicles
 
As relatively simple as the pricing analysis is for individual consumers, the purchase and deployment of heavy duty commercial vehicles involve consideration of many more variables. Here, the type of customer is a major determinant, whether it is a commercial customer buying trucks for a fleet or a municipal entity purchasing buses for public use. Navigant Research forecasts global sales of electric drive and electric-assisted medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles (over 10,000 gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)) to grow from 16,000 in 2014 to almost 160,000 in 2023, for total sales of over 800,000 of such vehicles during the period. Navigant Research expects the EV market share to increase from 0.4% to 2.9% of all medium and heavy duty commercial vehicle sales over the same period.
Environmental Benefits
 
Because heavy-duty commercial vehicles consume considerably more fuel than light duty passenger vehicles, the environmental benefits of replacing conventionally fueled commercial vehicles with EVs can also be substantial. Whereas an electric passenger car will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3 tons per year as compared to a conventional car, replacing a conventional Class 8 port drayage truck with an electric equivalent can bring an 18 metric ton annual reduction in GHG emissions. Replacing a conventional diesel bus with an all-electric bus can achieve a 78 metric ton reduction in GHG emissions. Electric buses can also reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 47 kg per year compared to a diesel bus and 19 kg compared to a Clean Natural Gas (CNG) bus. As discussed below, these pollution reductions have had the greatest impact in the electric bus market, where municipalities are the principal purchasers. 
Electricity Cost Considerations
 
Despite the higher electricity consumption of electric trucks, more widespread adoption could lead to more efficient utilization of utility and power generation assets and thus not necessarily lead to higher rates. At this point, deployment of electric trucks and buses is still too small to assess their full impact on electricity prices. As a study by the clean transportation nonprofit CALSTART emphasizes, evaluating this impact will involve weighing potential efficiency benefits, the impact on utility distribution grids, including the cost of potential upgrades, and the need for additional infrastructure.
 Trucks
 
Some of the main markets for electric trucks include delivery vans, shuttle buses, and utility or work trucks, each of which has its own set of challenges. Where PHEVs have greater operational flexibility, and require less charging infrastructure, BEVs can be either short range, which can charge quickly and operate with limited interruption, or long range, requiring longer charging times but more intraday operational flexibility. The table below presents a few of the examples of different kinds of vehicles, battery sizes, and electricity demands.

Table 1: Electricity Needs of Electric Truck and Bus Types
 

Technology Type | Example | Average Peak Demand | Battery Size 
-----------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------+--------------
Short Range PHEV | Volvo PHEV Class 8 Drayage Truck | 10 kW | 10kWh 
Work Truck PHEV | Odyne Advanced Diesel PHEV Truck | 3.3 kW | 14/28 kWh 
Long Range PHEV | Efficient Drivetrain PHEV/CNG Class 4 Truck | Up to 6.6 kW | 40 kWh 
Short Range BEV | Proterra Fast Charge Catalyst | 280 to 380 kW* | 53 or 131 kWh
Medium Range BEV | Transpower Electric Drayage Drive | 70 kW | 215 kWh 
Long Range BEV | BYD 40-foot Electric Transit Bus | 80 kW or 200 kW | 324 kWh 

 
* For deployments of 4 to 8 buses per fast charger
 
Because of charging needs and restrictions, short-haul fleet vehicles that operate in a limited geographic area and return to central locations, such as delivery vans and shuttle buses, are the best candidates for electrification.
 
Buses—Transit
 
For a number of reasons, we believe buses present a more promising near-term market for electrification than other commercial vehicles. First, most bus purchases are public in nature, coming from transit agencies or school districts. As a later survey of government policies in the United States and abroad will show, many locales require public transportation operators to purchase and operate low-emissions vehicles. For public entities, cleaner transportation systems can provide benefits beyond reduced operating costs, in the form of less pollution and lower abatement and cleanup costs. Second, electric drive buses are likely to have lower fuel and maintenance costs, typically a large cost area for transit operators, compared to conventional diesel buses. Third, we believe electric buses have smoother, faster acceleration and provide a quieter, smoother ride, benefiting both passengers and the surrounding urban environment.
 
Similar to passenger cars and commercial fleets, high initial costs and the logistics of charging remain the greatest drawbacks. As detailed in the table below, depending on the market, hybrid buses can cost at least 40% more than, and sometimes over twice as much as, conventional diesel or CNG buses. Electric buses can be anywhere from two to nearly five times as expensive as conventional buses.
 
Table 2: Hybrid and Electric Transit Bus Estimated Prices by Region, 2014
 

Market | Conventional (Diesel and CNG) | | Hybrid | Electric
--------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+--------+---------
China | $ | 60,000–90,000 | | $ | 125,000–200,000 | $ | 280,000–350,000
India | $ | 75,000–110,000 | | $ | 175,00–255,000 | $ | 325,000–410,000
Russia | $ | 130,000–180,000 | | $ | 245,000–325,000 | $ | 400,000–500,000
South America | $ | 200,000–225,000 | | $ | 280,000–340,000 | $ | 410,000–500,000
North America | $ | 420,000–580,000 | | $ | 620,000–700,000 | $ | 850,000–980,000
Europe | $ | 300,000–410,000 | | $ | 450,000–540,000 | $ | 595,000–680,000
Rest of World | $ | 100,000–350,000 | | $ | 195,000–500,000 | $ | 300,000–700,000

 
Hybrid buses have gained greater traction than pure electric models in China and India, the two largest markets for electric buses. Both countries have some of the world’s worst urban pollution, as well as cities where buses form a greater part of public transportation than rail systems. Both China and India have a number of domestic hybrid and electric bus manufacturers, including Yutong, Xiamen King Long Motor Group, BYD, Nanjing Golden Dragon Bus, and Zhongtong Bus in China and Tata and Ashok Leyland in India. Of the 500,000 city buses in operation in China in 2014, analysts estimate that 80,000 were electric (presumably including hybrid electric models), with 27,000 more sold in 2014 and about 20,000 sold through the first half of 2015. The five companies just mentioned accounted for 62.5%, or 17,011, of the buses sold in 2014.

Electric drive or hybrid electric buses made up 17% of bus fleets in the United States in 2014, with most being gasoline or diesel hybrids, which made up between 30% and 40% of new bus sales. At the end of 2016, there were over 300 zero-emissions buses, that is, fully electric or fuel cell-powered buses, operating in transit fleets throughout the nation. A CALSTART executive has estimated that that zero-emissions models will make up 20% of the transit bus market by 2030. As an example of the cost impact of purchasing new electric buses, the Chicago Transit Authority recently committed to purchase 20–30 buses over the next few years, at a total pre-subsidy cost of $30 million to $40 million.
 
In the United States, the major sellers of battery electric buses through 2014 were Proterra and BYD, having sold 110 and 102 electric buses respectively. BYD expected to sell an additional 200 electric buses in the United States in 2015, and has sold approximately 5,200 worldwide.
 
Buses—School
 
School buses present another significant potential market for electrification. The United States has 480,000 school buses carrying 25 million children to school every day. The typically short, predictable routes of school buses are particularly suited to running solely on electricity. Traditional diesel school buses, which make up over half the total fleet, not only consume large amounts of fuel—more than 800 million gallons of diesel a year in the United States, at a fuel economy of only 4 mpg—but also directly impact children with tailpipe emissions. In response, a number of states have included school buses in clean transportation mandates, and some school districts, notably in California and Illinois, have begun to replace diesel buses with electric. Navistar introduced the first known hybrid model in 2007, improving fuel economy by 30%, or up to 65% for a plug-in hybrid model, and other manufacturers followed suit, but we are not aware of any current hybrid manufacturing of school buses taking place.
 
As of 2016, the number of electric buses in China had already reached approximately 343,500 units, including 300,000 BEVs. Efforts by the government of China, including its use of subsidies and ambitious efforts by certain cities regarding electrification of their bus fleets, continue to influence substantially the rate of growth of the electric bus market. For example, Shenzhen has sought to convert 100% of its bus fleet to electric buses in 2017.
 
Market Drivers
 
A number of factors impact both the supply and demand for various types of EVs and we believe that we are well positioned to benefit as a result of these driving forces. Except for energy storage technologies, discussed earlier, subsequent sections will address these market drivers in greater detail.
 
We believe prominent drivers of supply include:
 

· | The declining cost and higher availability of energy storage technologies, specifically the cost and capacity of rechargeable lithium ion batteries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Grants, loans, tax breaks, and other financial support available for energy storage and EV research and development; 
· | Requirements that a specific percentage of automakers’ models be electric or other zero-emission vehicles; and 
· | Fuel economy standards that require automakers to meet certain fleet-wide benchmarks. 

 
We believe prominent drivers of demand include:
 

· | Mandates that government fleets purchase certain percentages of low emission, energy efficient, or other alternative fuel vehicles; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Mandates for transport agencies, ports or school districts to purchase or convert to electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;

-


· | Rebates, tax credits, and other incentives for purchasing or leasing electric or other alternative fuel vehicles; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The availability of charging stations and other charging infrastructure, driven in turn by government funding, tax credits, rebates, and other incentives and regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing the number of charging stations;
· | The cost of electricity to recharge PEVs, impacted by special rates introduced by utilities; 
· | Preferential treatment in registration, emissions testing, and access to highways, city centers, and HOV lanes; and 
· | The cost of traditional petroleum-based fuels compared to the resultant incremental costs of owning and operating an EV. 

 
United States—Federal Laws and Incentives
 
As numerous as U.S. policies at the state and federal levels may at first appear, unlike in China and many European nations, few federal and state policies directly single out EVs. More broadly, federal U.S. policies encourage greater use of vehicles that run on some kind of alternative fuel, whether electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel or ethanol. In addition, the U.S. federal government has less of a comprehensive, coherent framework aimed at increasing EV use than do countries like China and many European nations.
 
United States—State Laws and Incentives
 
Among U.S. states, California is notable for pioneering a number of measures that have encouraged EV production and adoption, often later copied by other jurisdictions. These include financial incentives like tax credits and rebates for both individual and fleet owners, HOV lane access, and various grant and loan programs. Besides setting the nation’s most stringent tailpipe emissions standards, California has required automakers to produce increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles, of which EVs make up a significant portion, along with creating a market that allows manufacturers to buy and sell credits awarded for selling EVs. Assembly Bill (AB) AB 923 became effective January 1, 2005 and effective January 1, 2012, AB 470 authorized using AB 923 funding for the purchase of new school buses or retrofit of existing buses to accomplish the primary goal of reducing children’s exposure to both cancer-causing and smog-forming pollutants. Administered by CARB, AB 923 authorizes state funding of up to $400,000 per new zero-emission school buses and up to $200,000 for the conversion of existing school buses ten years old or newer. The purchase of new buses, restricted to replacement of existing buses prior to AB 923, is now permitted for fleet expansion as well. The buses’ GVWR to be eligible for funding must exceed 14,000,001 GVWR. All-electric school bus conversions that use technologies already demonstrated on school buses, and with engineering plans, are eligible for AB 923 funding. All vehicles receiving AB 923 funding must have CHP Safety Certifications that are submitted to CARB prior to receiving funding. AB 923 contains other legal and technical requirements for the buses, with which we believe all of our products comply.
 
Fleet Operator Challenges
 
Fleet operators and their companies face a number of challenges in the market today, including:
 

· | Difficulty complying with existing and new federal and state emission restrictions and compliance requirement. Federal regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, and state regulatory agencies, such as CARB, have set forth mandates designed to reduce emissions from mobile sources. At least 10 other states follow CARB rules and regulations making similar requirements and more are expected to join along with the EPA at the federal level.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Finding cost savings while managing high fuel, maintenance and repair costs. The federal Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007 set strict air quality standards for particulate matter, nitrous oxide and GHG reductions from new manufactured vehicles which were further tightened in 2010 to further reduce the amounts of particulate matter, nitrous oxide and GHG emitted by newly manufactured vehicles. 


8
-


· | Extending the lives of existing vehicles. Due to reductions in capital expenditure budgets and the legislatively mandated addition of expensive and limiting emission reduction equipment, it is challenging to prolong the lives of existing vehicles because of the increased cost of expensive maintenance, service and repairs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Difficulty planning for the operation of their fleet when fuel supplies are interrupted, such as during a natural disaster. Existing vehicles rely on fuel that must be pumped (using electricity) which may be a challenge to source when supply is interrupted during natural or man-made disasters. It may be possible for emergency service organizations to use the large battery packs of electric drive, commercial fleet vehicles as a mobile source of stored electrical energy. This electrical energy could supplement traditionally fueled back-up generators. 
· | Difficulty in improving the environment around these heavy-duty commercial fleets. Many studies have shown that the air quality in and around vehicles fueled by fossil-fuels poses a health risk not only to drivers of these vehicles but to their passengers and those in and around these vehicles. Especially at risk are children as passengers on older diesel fueled buses, as their lungs, brains and other organs have not fully developed and the air quality surrounding a typical school bus using diesel fuel can pose serious health risks. By using zero-emission buses, trucks and cars, we believe we are creating a healthier environment in and around the vehicles they operate for their employees, customers and the communities they serve.

Our Solution
 
We design advanced zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles and replacement drivetrain systems that improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. Our drivetrain systems are designed to help vehicles run more efficiently and cost effectively. We subcontract the manufacturing of our completed drivetrains to two facilities in Northern California, to which we provide our patented zero-emission drivetrain design and which is completed under our supervision. At this time, we do not manufacture complete vehicles. We sell our zero-emission drivetrains to third party OEMs with whom we partner and they manufacture the complete vehicle after installing the drivetrain under our supervision. As of December 31, 2017, we have built 15 drivetrains, six of which we have installed and the balance of which we have used for proof-of-concept and testing.
 
We enable our customers to:
 

· | Add Emission-Compliant ADOMANI Vehicles and Drivetrain Systems to Their Fleets. Our commercial fleet vehicles and drivetrain systems are designed to reduce or eliminate the use of traditional petroleum-based fuels that create greenhouse gases and particulate matter. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Reduce Total Cost of Ownership. Our technology is designed to reduce fuel budgets by eliminating or reducing the reliance on traditional petroleum-based fuels, instead using the more energy efficient and less variably priced grid-provided electricity. 
· | Prolong Lives of Existing Vehicles. Zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs. These reduced maintenance costs may take the form of longer service intervals between brake system maintenance, reduction or elimination of internal combustion engine oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of transmission oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of air filter changes, reduction or elimination of emissions systems services, reduction or elimination of diesel emission fluid use, elimination of emissions tests on traditional fuel vehicles (if converted to a zero-emission electric drivetrain) and the elimination of certification tests of high pressure tanks on propane, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas powered vehicles (if converted to a zero-emission electric drivetrain).

· | Plan for Natural Disasters When Fuel Supply May be Interrupted. Our zero-emissions systems can serve as on-site emergency back-up energy storage if grid power becomes intermittent or fails temporarily during natural or man-made disasters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Improve the Environment Around Vehicles. As a result of our zero-emission systems, drivers, operators, customers and the communities they serve could have healthier environments in and around these vehicles. 

    Development of the Business to Date
 
We have developed and commercialized our products and services, which primarily include:
 

· | Zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for use in “new” school bus and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for use in “existing fleet” school bus and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. 
· | Conversion hybrid drivetrain systems in an assistive hybrid format for use in private and commercial fleet vehicles of all sizes. 
· | Conversion hybrid drivetrain systems in a “full-traction” format for use in private and commercial fleet vehicles of all sizes. 
· | Purpose-built, zero-emission vehicles of all sizes manufactured by outside OEM partners but to be marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through the developing ADOMANI distribution and service network.
· | Optional drivetrain components that allow for advanced remote monitoring features of vehicle location (geofencing), driver behavior, drivetrain health (error codes) and battery management systems. 
· | Optional drivetrain components that allow for electric power-export and various levels of grid connectivity. 

 
We have taken an active role in building awareness and support for our zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems in industry specific target groups and at all levels of government and regulatory agencies and the constituencies they serve. We have accomplished this through prior and current memberships in industry groups (private and governmental) and participation in their events; speaking engagements; management interviews; pilot product exhibits; fleet vehicle demonstrations and responses to Requests For Information and Requests For Proposals. In addition to the visibility we have achieved through these efforts, we believe that having an office in Silicon Valley will assist us in finding and recruiting appropriately trained engineers and technicians.
 
As discussed below under the section entitled “—Partnerships/Teaming Agreements”, we have entered into a number of agreements with third parties and continue to explore additional alliances, to establish our decentralized assembly, sales and service model. We believe we can preserve cash resources and yet still scale-up quickly when demand requires by leveraging the unused or underutilized service technician time, specific vehicle type expertise and service facility equipment of specific partners in ways to off-load some defined tasks, providing seasonal demand adjustments to technician headcount that will partially mitigate the human resource costs and challenges associated with scaling-up or down an employee base.
 
Our Strengths
 
We believe the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:

--


· | Product Diversity. We have multiple product offerings including zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains, new purpose-built zero-emission EVs and stationary energy storage solutions and, as a result, the ability to scale-up, scale-down or refine a specific product line in response to market demands and the evolving local, state and federal regulatory and incentive programs. Also, within each product area, we have multiple suppliers of key drivetrain components, allowing price flexibility both for our final products and replacement parts required over the product lifespan. This allows us to meet the expectations and budget constraints of public or private commercial fleet operators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Regulatory Agency Familiarity. By taking an active role in many trade industry groups and related events, we have developed and continually strive to maintain strong relationships with key local, state and federal regulatory agencies involved in the growing zero-emission and hybrid vehicle industry. To meet their own aggressive emissions targets, these regulatory agencies have encouraged the growth of zero-emission EVs and hybrid drivetrains, especially in connection with heavy-duty commercial fleets. 
· | Relationships With Purchasers. To help shorten the sales cycles for our products, we have identified and built relationships with key commercial operators that have purchasing authority or influence over their organizations. We are also able to leverage past sales and marketing relationships that were built by our experienced management team. 
· | Additional Sales Potential. We have additional sales potential with commercial fleet customers. These potential additional sales could include: automated charging infrastructure, intelligent stationary energy storage systems that enable higher levels of vehicle fast-charging, emergency back-up facility power for use during grid power outages, enabling technologies to access the developing grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs, or enabling technologies that allow for the avoidance of electric utility demand charges. 
· | Unique Market Knowledge. We have specific and tailored sales cycle knowledge based on the over 30 years of experience of our management team. 

Our Strategy
 
We intend to capitalize on these opportunities by pursuing the following key strategies:
 

· | Develop Sales Staff. We plan to hire and train our initial sales staff to complement our current group. Training will include familiarizing them with the many and varied funding options available, and how to access those opportunities, or help our customers access them. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build Dealership Networks. We intend to build dealership networks for the local sales and service of our zero-emission replacement drivetrain vehicles and new purpose-built zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles either manufactured by or for us. 
· | Develop Third Party Relationships. We plan to complete existing negotiations with partners and seek additional partners for the manufacture of our zero-emission systems. 
· | Provide Demonstrations. We will seek out and respond to local, state and federal pilot demonstration opportunities in interest areas for which we have relevant current product offerings or, in areas of interest that are congruent with product(s) that are on our product development roadmap but still in early stage development. 
· | Obtain Approvals From Incentive Programs. We will seek to have our products approved for various local, state and federal vehicle designations and incentive programs, like the California Heavy Duty Voucher Incentive Project administered by CARB, meant to accelerate the purchase of cleaner, more efficient trucks and buses in California.

· | Grow Our Manufacturing, Installation and Service Capability. As facility space and technician time requirements at partners are exceeded, we intend to expand or relocate to larger ADOMANI-owned or leased facilities dedicated to the manufacture, installation and service of our zero-emission systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Introduce New Products. As new markets develop, we plan to expand our zero-emission systems into ancillary product verticals, such as charging infrastructure also called Electric Vehicle Service Equipment, stationary energy storage, vehicle-to-grid hardware and capabilities. 
· | Develop Our International Business. We plan to develop our business internationally. For example, we intend to pursue opportunities in China through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADOMANI China. While we believe that China is an important market for us due in part to its publicly announced emphasis on hybrid and all-EVs and large population, we remain in the early stages of the development of our business plan to pursue such opportunities, including the consideration of a proposal to develop a facility in Nantong, China to fulfill conversion kit orders within China, and continue to assess the logistics and costs associated with the production and sale of our zero-emission drivetrains into China.

Testing
 
Our suppliers are vetted before their products are accepted for use in our products. Our drivetrains and finished products are inspected, road-tested and receive a complete quality control report prior to delivery.
Customer Service, Support and Training
 
The sales team, both direct and contractors, will be used as the first point of customer contact for customer support and training. At the point that the sales force can no longer handle the volume of these requirements, we will hire, train and support an additional internal staff.
Technology
 
Zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for purpose-built new vehicles generally include the following; electric traction motor/generator of sufficient kW power for grade, speed, acceleration and efficiency requirements, a motor controller/inverter system that modulates electrical power flow between the battery packs and traction motor, a gear reduction system or multispeed transmission, systems to electrify power steering/brakes, a vehicle control unit (VCU), high-voltage traction battery packs with integrated battery management system (BMS), battery disconnect units (BDU), thermal management systems, vehicle charging hardware, electric HVAC systems, DC to DC inverter(s) to reduce traction battery pack voltage sufficient to operate on-board, low voltage systems, wiring harnesses, user/driver interface and remote diagnostic/tracking/fault code/data logging systems. Although clear industry power-export standards have not yet been adopted, systems and options for a variety of vehicle-to-other power management options (such as grid, building, stationary energy storage, etc.) that are being developed by multiple vendors.
 
Re-power drivetrain systems to convert existing traditionally-fueled fleet vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) to zero-emission operation include many of the same components as described above for purpose-built vehicle systems. For simplicity, cost saving and maintenance technician familiarity, some OEM systems of the subject vehicle may be retained/utilized and these could include cooling systems for the engine and transmission, mounting brackets and bolts, power steering and brake systems and 12 and/or 24 volt systems and accessories. Items that are typically not retained/repurposed include the OEM internal combustion engine, transmission, liquid or gaseous fuel tanks and exhaust/treatment systems.
 
Our post-transmission hybrid drivetrain systems uses power from an electric motor to assist traditionally-fueled vehicles to allow for a range of either better overall miles-per-gallon fuel use or increased performance levels (when both ICE and electric motor are in use).
 
Our research and development expenses were $586,899, $37,000 and $549,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 is primarily due to $420,000 incurred in the second quarter of 2017 to build and install our drivetrain system on a chassis of a Type D school bus, on a promotional basis, for a potential customer. The project also enabled us to evaluate a third party firm that performed the work. The balance of the increase occurred because we were required to pay other research and development consultants under the terms of an employment agreement with our former Chief Technology Officer. The decrease in 2016 was due to much of this work being capitalized related to building a specific demonstration vehicle. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales
 
We intend to expand our marketing and sales force as we open our sales, service and assembly facilities. We expect that each facility will have a team of dedicated marketing and sales employees with responsibility for the geographic region in which the facility is located. As a result, we believe we can efficiently and cost-effectively build out our marketing and sales network.

Marketing
 
We plan to focus our marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, generating demand for our products, communicating product advantages and generating qualified leads for our sales force. We intend to rely on a variety of marketing vehicles, including participation in industry conferences and trade shows, public relations, industry research and our collaborative relationships with our business and teaming partners to share our technical message with customers. We also market our products on our website.
Manufacturing
 
We intend initially to contract with third party suppliers to manufacture our products. Currently, we utilize the services of a third party manufacturer with whom we do not have a long-term or exclusive contractual relationship, and we continue to seek additional third party suppliers and other manufacturing support.
Distribution
 
We intend to distribute products to regional locations for installation into the motor vehicle.
 
Partnerships/Teaming Agreements
 
We have agreements with Blue Bird, GreenPower, Central States Bus Sales, Efficient Drivetrains Inc. and Envirotech Drive Systems Incorporated. None of these agreements contain any binding purchase or sales minimums. 
Blue Bird Corporation
 
Blue Bird offers a complete line of Type A, C and D school buses in a variety of options and configurations. In October 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with Blue Bird pursuant to which we will provide them, on an exclusive basis, with zero-emission electric drivetrains for use in their Type C and D school bus product lines. The agreement sets forth the applicable pricing for the products to be purchased thereunder, but does not include any binding minimum purchase obligations on behalf of Blue Bird. During the term of the agreement, Blue Bird must purchase all zero-emission electric drivetrains to be used in their Type C and Type D school bus product lines from us, and we have agreed that we will not sell any zero-emission electric drivetrains to any similar manufacturer of school and activity buses, or to suppliers or subcontractors who would resell such products to such bus manufacturers. The agreement, however, does not prevent us from selling zero-emission electric drivetrains for any other application. The agreement provides that we will indemnify Blue Bird against certain losses resulting from our breach of the agreement and certain other losses. Blue Bird may terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon certain events or without cause upon thirty days prior written notice to us. In November 2017 at the National Association for Pupil Transportation industry event, Blue Bird unveiled the Type C bus in which our zero emission electric drivetrain was installed, and conducted ride-and-drive tours in the Type D bus that they completed after the STN show. We also organized an extensive ride-and-drive tour for them in California in early 2018.
GreenPower Motor Company, Inc.
 
GreenPower produces a range of bus models deploying electric drivetrain and battery technologies with a lightweight chassis. GreenPower integrates key components from such global suppliers as Siemens, Knorr, ZF and Parker, among others, providing an OEM platform that allows them to meet the specifications of various operators. GreenPower has appointed us as its authorized factory representative for California for Types A, C and D zero-emission electric school buses on a non-exclusive basis pursuant to a three-year agreement. Assuming various milestones are achieved, the agreement with us will be ongoing and may expand into additional states or regions. The agreement may be terminated for cause upon thirty days prior written notice and the failure of the other party to cure the breach that resulted in such cause.
Central States Bus Sales (Central States)
 
Central States, a large Blue Bird school bus dealer and a large commercial bus dealer covering Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, entered into a teaming agreement with us pursuant to which both companies have agreed to work together on the conversion, marketing, selling and servicing of the many types of buses that Central States currently sells. Either party may request the other’s participation in the development of a project pursuant to the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by either party, for cause, on ninety days prior written notice.

Efficient Drivetrains, Inc.
 
Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. (EDI) develops and markets a range of state-of-the-art PHEV and EV drivetrain solutions worldwide. EDI’s leading-edge hybrid-electric and electric drivetrain systems and technologies enable OEMs to meet zero-emissions requirements while providing cost and efficiency advantages across nearly all platform classes and configurations. In October 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with EDI pursuant to which EDI will build for ADOMANI, on an exclusive basis, zero-emission electric drivetrains for sale to Blue Bird’s Type C and D school bus product lines. The agreement sets forth the applicable pricing for the products to be purchased thereunder, but does not include any binding minimum purchase obligations on behalf of ADOMANI. During the term of the agreement, we must purchase all of our production requirements of zero-emission electric drivetrains to be used in Type C and Type D school bus product lines from EDI, and we have agreed that we will not contract with any other manufacturer to produce any zero-emission electric drivetrains for use in any Type C or Type D school buses. The agreement, however, does not prevent us from purchasing zero-emission electric drivetrains for any other application. The agreement provides that we and EDI will indemnify each other against certain losses resulting from our breach of the agreement and certain other losses. Either party may terminate the agreement for cause upon certain events occurring and not being cured within prescribed time frames or without cause upon one hundred eighty days prior written notice to the other.
Envirotech Drive Systems Incorporated
 
Envirotech Drive Systems Incorporated (Envirotech) is a Canadian-based company that is engaged in the design, prototyping and certification of electric components and vehicles, including complete drivetrains. ADOMANI has engaged Envirotech to design and build a series of zero-emission electric Class 3-6 trucks, built to ADOMANI specifications and requirements. The trucks are comprised of a cab, chassis and electric drivetrain. Any customer can then customize the trucks by adding a box or stake bed to the vehicle as per their needs. Once tested and validated by ADOMANI, Envirotech will submit the vehicle emissions information to CARB for certification and sale via the issuing of an Executive Order (EO). Once the EO is received, ADOMANI will be able to provide the EO along with additional information to the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP) Department of CARB and apply for HVIP listing, making the trucks eligible for buy-down funding based on the GVWR. These buy-down funds will enable companies to purchase zero-emission electric trucks and receive a discount to aid in the purchase. The HVIP buy-down funding is currently between $55,000 for Class 3 trucks and $100,000 for Class 6 trucks.
Raw Materials and Supply Chain
 
Prices for the systems, components and raw materials we use in our drivetrain systems, many of which are OEM items used by many companies in different applications, can fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand. Our purchase of raw materials is currently limited due to sales volume, but we attempt to limit our exposure to raw material price increases and availability fluctuations by having relationships with a dynamic group of vendors that sell us value-added hardware, components and systems. We have further mitigated these supply chain risks by establishing purchasing relationships with multiple vendors that are diversified by type of product offered, brand of products offered, country of origin of products (which is relevant for “Buy American” provisions that we encounter with our customers), individual specification requirements, purchase quantity requirements, quality, availability and price. Our drivetrain systems allow for component substitution, which further mitigates our exposure to any one supplier or component. For example, for different drivetrain systems, our recent traction motor choices have included the following brands: UQM (US), Yasa (UK) and TM4 (China). We believe that we have adequate supplies and access to the sources of the systems, components and materials to meet our current and anticipated future production and supply requirements.

Backlog
 
As of March 7, 2018, our backlog consisted of purchase orders for 6 zero-emission electric school buses and 10 zero-emission electric drivetrains. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog consisted of purchaser orders for 4 zero-emission electric school buses and 2 zero-emission electric drivetrains. We believe our cost of the current backlog will be approximately $3.85 million (against which deposits of $1.02 million have been made), and that the sale price of the current backlog will be in excess of $4.0 million. We believe that deliveries will begin in the second half of 2018.
Employees
 
As of March 7, 2018, we had eleven full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
 
While we are not generally prone to seasonal fluctuations in our business, many state and federal agencies operate on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and, as such, in the event that grants are over-subscribed during a given fiscal year, we may be unable to obtain funds in connection with any such state or federal grants until after June 30 of the subsequent fiscal year.
Competition
 
The power conversion vehicle market is highly competitive and we expect it to become even more so in the future as additional companies launch competing products and vehicle offerings. We compete with other alternative energy technologies, such as natural gas and hybrid technologies. These competitors include Ford, which produces the Ford Transit Connect EV®; Navistar, which produces the Navistar eStar®; Freightliner, which produces the MT E-CELL; Odyne Systems, which produces plug-in hybrid heavy- and medium-duty trucks; ZeroTruck, which produces an all-electric medium-duty truck; Electric Vehicles International, which produces an all-electric walk-in van and light- and medium-duty commercial electric trucks; BYD which manufactures new electric transit buses; Proterra, which manufactures new electric transit buses; TransPower which converts Type D school buses; and Motiv, which converts Type A school buses.
Intellectual Property
 
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we own three issued U.S. Patents which will expire in 2030 and 2033, and one issued Chinese utility model that will expire in 2026. Domestic and foreign applications are also pending on new inventions. In addition, we maintain a trademark portfolio including common law trademarks and service marks and have two service marks registered in the United States.
 
Circumstances outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we provide our solution. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and harm our operating results. In addition, as the number of competitors grows and solutions of competitors overlap, we may in the future face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our customers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.

Governmental Programs and Incentives
 
We believe that the availability of government subsidies and incentives currently is an important factor considered by our customers when purchasing vehicles that utilize our technology, and that our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Over time, we believe that the importance of the availability of government subsidies and incentives will decrease, as we continue to reduce the upfront cost of vehicles that utilize our technology. In order to help ensure that we and our customers benefit from available subsidies and incentive programs in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Asia and in Europe, we have incentive specialists that work directly with our sales team and our customers on these issues.
Overview of Incentive Programs Most Applicable to Our Products
 
We intend to seek to have our products approved for various local, state and federal incentive programs, including those set forth below. In particular, California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, which requires that a certain percentage of an automobile manufacturer’s sales must be zero-emission vehicles, has resulted in numerous incentive programs meant to accelerate the purchase and/or repower of cleaner, more efficient vehicles in California. We anticipate that the relevant aggregate funding available in California alone over the next several years may be in excess of $500 million.
California Hybrid and Zero-Emissions Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project
 
We believe our customers may be eligible for purchase under HVIP. HVIP is a partnership between CARB and CALSTART, the purpose of which is to help speed the early market introduction of clean, low-carbon hybrid and electric trucks and buses. Under HVIP, dealers and fleet operators may request vouchers from HVIP on a first-come first-serve basis, up to the funding amount available for that year, to reduce the cost of purchasing hybrid and zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses.
 
HVIP vouchers range in amount of up to $220,000, depending on the gross vehicle weight of the purchased vehicle and the number of vehicles purchased. School buses would be entitled to $220,000 for each new school bus.
 
HVIP funds the purchase of only fully commercialized hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses. Vehicles still in the demonstration or evaluation stage are not eligible for inclusion in HVIP. Vehicle manufacturers must apply to have their hybrid and zero-emissions trucks and buses included in HVIP’s voucher program. Once a make and model is included in the program, the manufacturer is not required to submit a full application for the succeeding year’s program unless the vehicle has been modified. We intend to comply with the HVIP guidelines and qualify our school buses and vehicles for the HVIP vouchers. Blue Bird received HVIP approval for a school bus powered by the ADOMANI drivetrain on November 7, 2017.
 
New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYT-VIP)
 
NYT-VIP is a first-come, first-served $19 million incentive program funded by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA). Eligible vehicles include all-electric, hybrid-electric, and CNG trucks and buses, along with retrofit diesel-emission control devices (DECD). Funding for eligible vehicles domiciled in New York State and New York City can reach $150,000 per vehicle. With the successful listing on the HVIP eligibility list of the Blue Bird bus mentioned above, ADOMANI has secured eligibility on the NYT-VIP list and currently qualifies for a $150,000 voucher per vehicle.
Drive Clean Chicago—Drive Clean Truck Program
 
Drive Clean Chicago is accelerating the adoption of advanced vehicle technologies for the commercial truck and taxi sectors in the Chicago six-county area by reducing the cost of new alternative fuel vehicles and public alternative fuel stations. The program from the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) offers incentives including $10,000 for CNG and electric taxis, up to $150,000 for hybrid and all-electric trucks, and 30% of the capital cost for CNG and fast-charge electric fueling stations.
 
In addition to these programs, there are many other state and federal programs that range from providing tax credits to providing funding to providing grants and loans for the purchase of zero-emission and hybrid vehicles. Many of the programs provide funding for up to 60% of the cost an all-electric repower conversion.

Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust Funds
 
We anticipate that the 23 states that we have prioritized may allocate approximately $260 million in funds per year for three years beginning in 2018 to on-road vehicle projects. These states are currently in the process of developing specific funding plans and we have successfully engaged with several of these states to support the development of such plans. We expect that these plans will be developed by the end of the first half of 2018 and that the first rounds of funding may become available thereafter in 2018.
California Air Resources Board
 
CARB gathers air quality data for the State of California, ensures the quality of this data, designs and implements air models, and sets ambient air quality standards for the state, with a particular focus on regulating tailpipe emissions and other mobile sources. CARB compiles the state’s emissions inventory and performs air quality and emissions inventory special studies. CARB uses the Emissions Inventory and Air Quality Models to evaluate air quality and reduce emissions in each of California’s 35 local air districts.
 
CARB also manages several incentive and rebate programs and awards hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to reduce emissions from on- and off-road vehicles and equipment. CARB is responsible for program oversight. CARB awards grants and funds through the Air Quality Improvement Program (AB 118); the Carl Moyer Program; the Voucher Incentive Program for enhanced fleet modernization and emission reduction; and the Lower-Emission School Bus Program/School Bus Retrofit and Replacement Account.
    California Energy Commission
 
The California Energy Commission (CEC) has several core responsibilities, including but not limited to setting energy policy, developing renewable energy, achieving energy efficiency, and transforming California’s transportation infrastructure. One goal of the CEC is to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the impact of climate change. The CEC carries out its responsibilities pursuant to several of California’s landmark environmental laws. In 2006, the Legislature passed and then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two landmark pieces of legislation with far-reaching implications for energy policy. The most comprehensive is AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which sets an economy-wide cap on California GHG emissions at 1990 levels by no later than 2020. At the time, this was an aggressive goal that represented an approximately 11 percent reduction from then-current emissions levels and nearly a 30 percent reduction from projected business-as-usual levels in 2020. In 2015, California passed Senate Bill (SB) 350, which further committed California to reducing GHG emissions by establishing a 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels. The transportation sector represents a significant portion of California’s GHG emissions.
 
In 2007, AB 118 created the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. The program is intended to increase the use of alternative and renewable fuels and innovative technologies that will transform California’s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state’s climate change policies. AB 118 authorizes the CEC to provide approximately $100 million annually as incentives to public agencies, vehicle and technology consortia, businesses, public-private partnerships, workforce training partnerships and collaboratives, fleet owners, consumers, recreational boaters, and academic institutions for projects that: develop and improve alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels; optimize alternative and renewable fuels for existing and developing engine technologies; improve light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle technologies; and retrofit medium-and heavy-duty on-road and non-road vehicle fleets.
 
Air Quality Management Districts (AQMD) and Air Pollution Control Districts (APCD)
 
California’s AQMDs/APCDs are responsible for controlling emissions primarily from stationary sources of air pollution such as large power plants and refineries, but also have a role in distributing funds and administering incentive programs from mobile sources—primarily cars, trucks and buses, but also construction equipment, ships and trains, from which approximately seventy five percent of emissions are generated. The largest AQMD/APCDs are the South Coast AQMD, Bay Area AQMD, San Joaquin Valley APCD, and the San Diego APCD. Local AQMDs/APCDs develop and adopt an Air Quality Improvement Plans (AQIP), which serves as the blueprint to bring the respective areas into compliance with federal and state clean air standards. Rules are adopted to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints and solvents, even consumer products. Permits are issued to many businesses and industries to ensure compliance with air quality rules. Local AQMDs award grants to help reduce emissions in their local communities. These grants and incentive programs include programs aimed at reducing emissions from mobile sources such as buses and trucks.

Clean Cities
 
Clean Cities is a program administered by the federal Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technology Program. According to the DOE, the mission of Clean Cities is to advance the energy, economic, and environmental security of the United States by supporting local decisions to adopt practices that reduce the use of petroleum in the transportation sector. Clean Cities is a government-industry partnership. Under the program, public and private stakeholders from businesses, city and state governments, the automotive industry, fuel providers, and community organizations form coalitions throughout the country, which then work with the DOE to establish a plan for reducing petroleum consumption in their respective geographic areas.
National Clean Diesel Program / Diesel Emissions Reduction Act
 
The National Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program, which is administered by the EPA National Clean Diesel Campaign, provides funding under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act for projects that seek to reduce emissions from existing diesel engines. Eligible applicants include U.S. regional, state and local agencies that have jurisdiction over transportation or air quality and certain nonprofit institutions that provide pollution reduction or educational services to owners and operators of diesel fleets or that have as their principal purpose the promotion of transportation or air quality. Among the eligible uses of funding under this program are the purchase of buses and medium and heavy-duty trucks that result in reduced diesel emissions.
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program
 
The CMAQ Improvement program, which is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration, provides funding to states to support surface transportation projects and other related efforts that contribute air quality improvements and provide congestion relief. CMAQ funding is allocated to the states annually based on a statutory formula that is based on population and air quality classification as designated by the EPA. Each state’s transportation department then is responsible for distributing the funds. State transportation departments may spend CMAQ funds on projects that reduce ozone precursors, and at least 16 states have used CMAQ funds for alternative fuel vehicle projects (such as purchasing electric or hybrid vehicles). 
Other State Incentives
 
A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions and special privileges. For example, Maryland has introduced a voucher program that provides financial assistance for the purchase of electric trucks registered in that state, and Arizona exempts use tax and lowers registration fees for the purchase of an EV. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, Utah, Florida and West Virginia, provide for substantial state tax credits for the purchase of EVs.
Government Regulation
 
Our products are designed to comply with a significant number of governmental regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to ours are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have upon our business. We believe that vehicles that utilize our technology are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions.

Emission and Fuel Economy Standards
 
Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which had an initial phase-in starting with model year 2014 and a final phase-in occurring in model year 2017. NHTSA standards for model years 2014 and 2015 were voluntary, while mandatory standards first went into effect in 2016. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2027 to improve fleet fuel efficiency and cut carbon emissions.
 
The rule provides emission standards for carbon dioxide and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors, (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and (iii) vocational vehicles. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
 
The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, including an engine averaging banking and trading (ABT), program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs allows for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
 
 Vehicle Safety and Testing
 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act), regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our modified vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
Battery Safety and Testing
 
We believe our battery packs conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” which includes lithium-ion batteries that may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by PHMSA, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The requirements for shipments of these goods vary by mode of transportation, such as ocean vessel, rail, truck and air.
 
Our battery suppliers have completed the applicable transportation tests including:
 

· | Altitude simulation, which involves simulating air transport; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Thermal cycling, which involves assessing cell and battery seal integrity; 
· | Vibration, which involves simulating vibration during transport; 
· | Shock, which involves simulating possible impacts during transport; 
· | External short circuit, which involves simulating an external short circuit; and 
· | Overcharge, which involves evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging.
