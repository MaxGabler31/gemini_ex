ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
----------------------------------------------------+---------

General 
 
Lipocine Inc. (“Lipocine” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated on June 19, 1997, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our oral drug delivery technology for the development of pharmaceutical products focusing on neuroendocrine and metabolic disorders. Our proprietary delivery technologies are designed to improve patient compliance and safety through orally available treatment options. Our primary development programs are based on oral delivery solutions for poorly bioavailable drugs. We have a portfolio of differentiated innovative product candidates that target high unmet needs for neurological and psychiatric CNS disorders, liver diseases, and hormone supplementation for men and women.


We entered into a license agreement for the development and commercialization our product candidate, TLANDO®, an oral testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT”) comprised of testosterone undecanoate (“TU”). TLANDO is a registered trademark assigned to Antares. On October 14, 2021, we entered into a license agreement (the “Antares License Agreement”) with Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares” or our “Licensee”), pursuant to which we granted to Antares an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize, upon final approval of TLANDO from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the TLANDO product for TRT in the U.S. Any FDA required post-marketing studies will also be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares. Prior to entering into the License Agreement, on December 8, 2020, we received tentative approval from the FDA regarding our new drug application (“NDA”) filed in February 2020 for TLANDO as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. In granting tentative approval, the FDA concluded that TLANDO has met all required quality, safety and efficacy standards necessary for approval. However, TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval to market in the U.S. until the expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Clarus”) with respect to Jatenzo®, which expires on March 27, 2022. The FDA has affirmed to Antares the acceptance of the resubmission of the NDA for TLANDO filed on January 28, 2022. The FDA has designated the NDA as a Class 1 resubmission with a two-month review goal period and set a target action date of March 28, 2022 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).
 
Additional pipeline candidates include: LPCN 1148 comprising a novel prodrug of testosterone, testosterone laurate (“TL”), for the management of decompensated cirrhosis; LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of androgen receptor modulator for the treatment of non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) which has completed phase 2 testing; LPCN 1111 (TLANDO® XR), a next generation oral TRT product comprised of testosterone tridecanoate (“TT”) with the potential for once daily dosing which has completed Phase 2 testing; LPCN 1107, potentially the first oral hydroxy progesterone caproate (“HPC”) product indicated for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth (“PTB”), which has completed a dose finding clinical study in pregnant women and has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA; and neuroactive steroids (“NAS”) including LPCN 1154 for postpartum depression (PPD) and LPCN 2101 for epilepsy.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business and delay our preclinical and clinical programs and timelines. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future operating results and financial condition is uncertain. We initiated our LPCN 1148 Phase 2 trial for the management of cirrhosis in 2021. The COVID-19 surge observed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 has impacted enrollment in this study. We do not yet know the full extent, if any, of any potential delays or commercial challenges, which could prevent or delay Antares from commercially launching TLANDO. For more information regarding risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, please see the risk factor entitled “The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus around the world could adversely impact our business and operating results,” in Part I. Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our proprietary drug delivery technology for the development of pharmaceutical products focusing on neuroendocrine and metabolic disorders. The key components of our strategy are to:
 
Build a diversified multi-asset pipeline of novel therapies. We intend to employ a value-driven strategy based on our proprietary technology platform to identify and develop product candidates for neuroendocrine and metabolic disorders including Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders and end stage diseases such as decompensated cirrhosis. We intend to focus on product candidates that we believe are differentiated, have attractive profiles, and address a clear unmet medical need that we can advance quickly and efficiently into late-stage development.

Advance LPCN 1148, a unique prodrug of androgen receptor agonist to manage end stage (decompensated) liver cirrhosis disease. We believe LPCN 1148, a novel prodrug of testosterone, could address a significant unmet medical need in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis accompanied with muscle disorder such as secondary sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in male cirrhotic patients is known to be independently associated with poor outcomes including quality of life, increased decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy, increased hospital admissions, and increased mortality rate. We believe LPCN 1148 may be eligible for an orphan drug designation. Enrollment in a multi-center placebo-controlled phase 2 trial is currently ongoing.
 
Support our licensee in commercialization of our licensed oral TRT option. We believe the TRT market needs a differentiated, convenient oral option. We have exclusively licensed rights to TLANDO to Antares for commercialization of TLANDO in the US. We plan to support our licensee’s efforts to effectively enable the availability of TLANDO to patients in a timely manner, in addition to receiving milestone and royalty payments associated with TLANDO commercialization as agreed to in the Antares License Agreement.
 
Develop partnership(s) to continue the advancement of pipeline assets. We continuously strive to prioritize our resources in seeking co-development partnerships of our pipeline assets. We currently plan to explore partnering of LPCN 1144, our candidate for treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH, LPCN 1107, our candidate for prevention of pre-term birth, and LPCN 1111, a once-a-day therapy candidate for TRT.
 
LPCN 1148: Oral Product Candidate for the Management of Decompensated Cirrhosis 
 
We are currently evaluating LPCN 1148 comprising testosterone laurate (TL) for the management of decompensated cirrhosis. We believe LPCN 1148 targets unmet needs for cirrhosis subjects including improvement in the quality of life of patients while on the liver transplant waiting list, prevention or reduction in the occurrence of new decompensation events, and improvement in post liver transplant survival, including outcomes and costs.
 
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 POC study (NCT04874350) in male cirrhotic subjects to evaluate the therapeutic potential of LPCN 1148 for the management of sarcopenia. The ongoing Phase 2 POC study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in male sarcopenic cirrhotic patients. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms. The treatment arm is an oral dose of LPCN 1148, and the second arm is a matching placebo. The primary endpoint is change in skeletal muscle index at week 24 with key secondary endpoints including change in liver frailty index, rates of breakthrough hepatic encephalopathy, and number of waitlist events, including all-cause mortality. Total treatment is expected to be 52 weeks. We currently expect enrollment in the Phase 2 study to be complete by the end of the second or third quarter of 2022 and top-line 24-week results by the end of 2022 or during the first quarter of 2023.
 
Key outcomes of interest from the Phase 2 study include clinical outcomes such as overall survival and new decompensation events (including hepatic encephalopathy and/or ascites occurrences), rates of survival to transplant, rates of hospitalizations, infections, etc., muscle changes such as muscle mass, body composition, myosteatosis (muscle fat), functional capacity changes such as liver frailty index (LFI), patient reported outcomes (PROs), and biochemical markers including hematocrit for anemia status, albumin, creatinine/kidney function, etc.

Disease Overview – Cirrhosis
 
There are over 2 million cases of cirrhosis worldwide, with over 500,000 people living with decompensated cirrhosis in the U.S. and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most rapidly increasing indication for liver transplant. 62% of those on the liver transplant (LT) waitlist are male. The economic burden (approximately $812,500/transplant) is high and continues to increase. Each year about half of the approximately 17,000 people in U.S. on the LT waitlist undergo transplant, while nearly 3000 patients either die or are removed from the list because they were “too sick to transplant.” 
 
Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands. Cirrhotic patients typically have a years-long silent, asymptomatic phase (compensated cirrhosis) until decreasing liver function and increasing portal pressure move the patient into the symptomatic phase (decompensated cirrhosis). Transition to decompensated cirrhosis is marked by clinical events including ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, and/or variceal hemorrhage. Decompensated subjects survive on average less than 2 years. Common causes of liver cirrhosis include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis B and C, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and cryptogenic.


Common complications in cirrhotic patients may include: compromised liver function, portal hypertension, varices in GI tract with internal bleeding, edema, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, compromised immunity with post-transplant acute rejection risk, high sodium levels, increased bilirubin, low albumin level, insulin resistance with impaired peripheral uptake of glucose, depression, accelerated muscle disorder in the form of sarcopenia, myosteotosis, and frailty with compromised energetics, bone diseases (e.g., osteoporosis), high alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cachexia, malnutrition, weight loss (>5%), symptoms of hypogonadism such as abnormal hair distribution, anemia, sexual dysfunction, testicular atrophy, muscle wasting, fatigue, osteoporosis, gynecomastia, inflammation with elevated cytokines, and infection risk leading to hospital admissions and possibly death.
 
Hepatic encephalopathy (“HE”), a significant decompensation event in patient with cirrhosis, is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal systemic shunting. Because the damaged liver cannot function normally (as in cirrhosis), neurotoxins such as ammonia are inadequately removed from systemic circulation and travel to the brain, where they affect neurotransmission. This can cause episodes of HE, which may present as alterations in consciousness, cognition, and behavior that range from minimal to severe. Overt HE occurs in 30% to 40% of patients with cirrhosis at some point during the clinical course of their disease. As the burden of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is increasing, the frequency of HE is also increasing.
 
Muscle Disorders and Cirrhosis
 
Muscle disorders secondary to cirrhosis could be manifested in the form of several inter-related characteristics such as sarcopenia, myosteotosis, and frailty impacting muscle mass, strength, quality, and function. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress have also been reported to accelerate muscle wasting. Muscle also plays a significant compensatory role in detoxifying ammonia, a neurotoxin and a myotoxin implicated in precipitation of HE in cirrhosis patients.
 
Sarcopenia and associated frailty affect up to 70% of cirrhotic men and are a leading cause of patients being removed from the LT wait list. Due to the lack of available organs and aging demographics of those on the waitlist, patients that do receive a transplant are “increasingly being described as frail”. The presence of sarcopenia or frailty is associated with increased risk of hospitalization and hepatic decompensation, a two-fold increase in waitlist mortality, poor post-transplant outcomes, and reportedly is equivalent to adding 9-10 points to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.
 
Sarcopenia is typically associated with body composition changes with decreased muscle mass and/or low skeletal muscle index. Change in one or more of appendicular lean mass, total lean mass, fat mass, high VAT (visceral adipose tissue), waist circumference, weight, and/or BMI are notable features. Myosteotosis (fat infiltration in muscles) is indicative of poor muscle quality. Frailty is a state of low energetics accompanied with low physical performance/mobility probably because of poor muscle strength/function and is assessed via various measures such as decreased gait speed, weak hand grip; slow rising from a chair, balance, isometric knee extension peak torque or a composite measure such as liver frailty index (LFI).
 
Reportedly, as shown in the figure below, muscle disorder such as sarcopenia and myosteotosis in cirrhosis could be a clinically meaningful predictor of survival and mortality with lower survival in cirrhotic patients with accompanying muscle disorders.

 Muscle Disorders and Mortality in Liver Cirrhosis
 
Sarcopenia develops in the majority of male cirrhosis patients. The main mechanisms associated with sarcopenia and decompensated cirrhosis include a catabolic state, progressive immobility, imbalance between muscle breakdown and formation, and hormonal changes. Patients are typically diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis upon development of cirrhotic symptoms (e.g., jaundice, HE), and the diagnosis is confirmed via various liver function/imaging tests (e.g., MELD score, liver biopsy, CT scan). A variety of clinical evaluations for muscle mass, strength, and function are typically used to diagnose sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in cirrhosis also correlates with decompensation events, particularly HE (sarcopenia is about 2-fold more prevalent in overt HE patients than those without overt HE). Notably, low testosterone in males is associated with sarcopenia, severity of cirrhosis, and mortality.

Reportedly, as shown in figure below, sarcopenia is a predictor for increased mortality in cirrhosis (about 2-fold higher compared to no sarcopenia).
 

Tantai et al. J. Hepatol. 2022, 76, 588–599
 
Reportedly, as shown in figure below, pre transplant sarcopenia in liver cirrhosis often produces poor post-transplant outcomes with higher mortality rates. Longer post-transplant hospitalization and rehabilitation can be demanding on the individual, both physically and financially.
 

Englesbe et al. J Am Coll Surg. 2010 Aug;211(2):271-8
 
Myosteatosis in cirrhosis 
 
Myosteatosis, fat infiltration in muscles, has been found in many cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant evaluation, and studies have associated it with more complications and poor survival. Myosteatosis is characteristically associated with liver steatosis in NAFLD, resulting from ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle. Myosteatosis may affect many individuals who do not meet the anthropometric criteria for sarcopenia or obesity. The accumulation of excess fat in extramyocellular compartments is mostly pathologic. It can be defined as intramuscular (between muscle fibers) or intermuscular (between muscle fascicles) and is associated with lower muscle function and strength, muscle atrophy, and physical disabilities.

Frailty and cirrhosis
 
Frailty is a state of low energetics accompanied with low physical performance/mobility, usually as a result of poor muscle strength/function and its presence is assessed via various measures such as decreased gait speed, weak hand grip, slow rising from a chair, poor balance, low isometric knee extension peak torque or a composite measure such as liver frailty index (LFI).
 
Reportedly, as shown in figure below, frailty predicts LT waitlist mortality among outpatients with cirrhosis regardless of the MELD score.
 

Lai et al. Am J Transplant. 2014 Aug;14(8):1870-9
 
The presence of frailty is associated with increased waitlist death/delisting
 
Moreover, it has also been reported, as shown in figure below, that there is a higher incidence of waitlist mortality as the frailty worsened.

Trajectory of liver frailty and mortality
 
Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs to treat secondary sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Lipocine is the only clinical-stage company pursuing decompensation in sarcopenic cirrhotic patients, and no regulatory precedent currently exists for the approval of decompensation or sarcopenia-targeted therapies. We believe LPCN 1148 has the potential to aid the management of decompensation events in male sarcopenic cirrhotic patients through the following possible mechanisms of action: myo-augmentation (impact muscle mass and/or quality and/or function) via myostatin inhibition, myosteatosis reduction, anti-catabolic effect, changes in body composition (increase lean mass and/or reduce fat mass) and slowing muscle autophagy; inducing hepato-effective actions with improved key liver injury markers; increase protein synthesis; improve anemia, induce immunomodulation with improvement of immuno-dysregulation, and to lower infection rates; anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects by lowering undesirable cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α; and to improve mitochondrial function.(1)

LPCN 1144: An Oral Prodrug of Bioidentical Testosterone Product Candidate for the Treatment of NASH
 
We are currently evaluating LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of bioidentical testosterone comprised of TU, for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH.
 
Disease Overview – NASH
 
NASH is a more advanced state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and can progress to a cirrhotic liver or liver failure, require liver transplant, and can result in hepatocellular carcinoma/ liver cancer, and death. Progression of NASH to end stage liver disease will soon surpass all other causes of liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Importantly, beyond these critical conditions, NASH and NAFLD patients additionally suffer heightened cardiovascular risk and, in fact, die more frequently from cardiovascular events than from liver disease. NAFLD/NASH is becoming more common due to its strong correlation with obesity and metabolic syndrome, including components of metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Twenty to thirty percent of the U.S. population is estimated to suffer from NAFLD and fifteen to twenty percent of this group progresses to NASH, which is a substantially large population that lacks an effective therapy. NASH is a silent killer that affects millions in the U.S. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. Approximately 50% of NASH patients are in adult males. In men, especially with comorbidities associated with NAFLD/NASH, testosterone deficiency has been associated with an increased visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance, which could be factors contributing to NAFLD/NASH. There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of NASH although there are several drug candidates currently under development with many clinical failures to date.
 
The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH include reduced ability to handle lipids, increased insulin resistance, injury to hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury. NASH patients have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting primarily from a caloric intake above and beyond energy needs. A healthy liver contains less than 5% fat, but a liver in someone with NASH can contain more than 20% fat. This abnormal liver fat contributes to the progression to NASH, a liver necro-inflammatory state that can lead to scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for some, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.
 
Markers of Liver Cell Death
 
Alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) is an enzyme that is produced in liver cells and is naturally found in the blood of healthy individuals. In liver disease, liver cells are damaged and, as a consequence, ALT is released into the blood, increasing ALT levels above the normal range. Physicians routinely test blood levels of ALT to monitor the health of a patient’s liver. ALT level is a clinically important biochemical marker of the severity of liver inflammation and ongoing liver disease. Elevated levels of ALT represent general markers of liver cell death and inflammation without regard to any specific mechanism. Aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) is a second enzyme found in the blood that is produced in the liver and routinely measured by physicians along with ALT. As with ALT, AST is often elevated in liver disease and, like ALT, is considered an overall marker of liver inflammation.
Diagnosis
 
Most people with NASH are asymptomatic and their disease is often discovered incidentally following a liver imaging procedure, such as an ultrasound, prescribed for other reasons or as part of an investigation for elevated liver enzymes. Once suspected clinically, a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH, which necessitates the joint presence of steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. Once pathologically confirmed, the severity of NAFLD and NASH is determined using the histologically validated NAFLD activity score, which grades disease activity on a scale of 0 to 8. The NAFLD activity score is the sum of the individual scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocellular ballooning (0 to 2) but does not include a score for fibrosis. Fibrosis staging (F0-F4) relies on the NASH CRN classification (F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = perisinusoidal or portal/periportal fibrosis (not both); F2 = both perisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosis; F3 = bridging fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis).

Histological diagnosis remains the gold standard for assessment of NASH and fibrosis. However, given that liver biopsy is associated with risks of pain, bleeding and other morbidity, as well as significant cost, the procedure is not practical for general patient screening. Several non-invasive tools such as clinical risk scores and imaging techniques are increasingly used to assess potential NASH patients. Clinical risk scores such as the NAFLD fibrosis score, Fibrosis-4 index, the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score and vibration-controlled transient elastography (“VCTE”), have been validated and are increasingly used. These tools have an excellent negative predictive value and an acceptable positive predictive value for detection of advanced (≥ F3) fibrosis and are increasingly used in clinical settings. Extensive efforts are also under way to develop non-invasive means to identify patients with NAS ≥ 4 or fibrosis ≥ F2 without a liver biopsy. In draft guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to identify biochemical or noninvasive imaging biomarkers that, once characterized and agreed by the FDA, could replace liver biopsies for patient selection and efficacy assessment in clinical trials.
 
We expect that the validation and subsequent adoption of these new tools will result in an increase in the diagnosis and treatment rates for NASH in the future.
 
Current Status
 
We have recently completed the LiFT Phase 2 clinical study in biopsy-confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH subjects. The LiFT clinical study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-arm study in biopsy-confirmed hypogonadal and eugonadal male NASH subjects with grade F1-F3 fibrosis and a target NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 4 with a 36-week treatment period. The LiFT clinical study enrolled 56 biopsy confirmed NASH male subjects. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms (Treatment A is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent, Treatment B is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent formulated with 217 mg of d-alpha tocopherol equivalent, and the third arm is twice daily matching placebo).
 
The primary endpoint of the LiFT clinical study was change in hepatic fat fraction via MRI-PDFF and exploratory liver fat/marker end points post 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, key secondary endpoints post 36 weeks of treatment included assessment of histological change for NASH resolution and/or fibrosis improvement (biopsy) as well as liver fat data (MRI-PDFF). The LiFT clinical study was not powered to assess statistical significance of any of the secondary endpoints. Other important endpoints included the following: change in liver injury markers, anthropomorphic measurements, lipids, insulin resistance and inflammatory/fibrosis markers; as well as patient reported outcomes.
 
Additionally, subjects have access to LPCN 1144 through an open label extension (“OLE”) study. The extension study will enable the collection of additional data on LPCN 1144 for up to a total of 72 weeks of therapy, as well as data for 36 weeks of therapy for those subjects on placebo in the LiFT study. The OLE is currently on-going and has enrolled 25 subjects. We expect topline results from the OLE study mid-2022.
 
Treatments with LPCN 1144 post 12 weeks of treatment resulted in robust liver fat reduction, assessed by MRI-PDFF, and showed improvement of liver injury markers with no observed tolerability issues.
 
Liver biopsies were performed at baseline (“BL”) and after 36 weeks of treatment (“EOS”). Prespecified biopsy analyses included NASH Clinical Research Network (“CRN”) scoring as well as a continuous paired (“Paired Technique”) and digital technique (“Digital Technique-Fibronest”). All biopsy analyses were performed on the same slides and the reads for the three techniques were done independently. Analysis sets included the NASH Resolution Set (all subjects that have BL and EOS biopsy with NASH at BL [NAS ≥4 with lobular inflammation score ≥ 1 and hepatocyte ballooning score ≥1 at BL] (n=37)), the Biopsy Set (all subjects with baseline and EOS biopsies (n=44)), and the Safety Set (all randomized subjects (n=56)).
 
Both LPCN 1144 treatment arms met with statistical significance the pre-specified accelerated approval regulatory endpoint of NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis based on NASH CRN scoring. Additionally, both treatment arms showed substantial improvement of the observed NASH activity in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning.

Key results from the LiFT clinical study are presented in the following tables and figures:
 


In both treatment arms, substantial reductions in markers of liver injury compared to placebo were observed post four weeks of treatment and were sustained through EOS. Using all available Safety Set data, ALT decreased up to a mean of 23.4 U/L at EOS from all group mean baseline of 51.5 U/L and AST decreased up to a mean of 13.3 U/L at EOS from all group mean baseline of 31.9 U/L.
 
Positive effects in appendicular lean mass and whole-body fat mass, an indicator overall tissue quality, based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were noted in both LPCN 1144 treatment arms.

Finding on liver injury marker and positive effects on body composition can be seen in the following table:
 

During the 36 weeks of treatment, LPCN 1144 was well tolerated with an overall safety profile comparable to placebo.
 
In November 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to LPCN 1144 as a treatment for non-cirrhotic NASH. The Fast Track program is designed to accelerate the development and expedite the review of products, such as LPCN 1144, which are intended to treat serious diseases and for which there is an unmet medical need.
 
We had a written only response from FDA for a LPCN 1144 Type C meeting with the FDA in January 2022 to discuss the development path forward with LPCN 1144. The FDA acknowledged that the NDA submission of LPCN 1144 would be via 505(b)2 regulatory pathway and agreed that no additional non-clinical studies are needed to support an NDA submission. The FDA recommended to request an end of phase 2 (EOP2) meeting. The FDA acknowledged that in the LiFT study subjects achieved improvements in key components associated with NASH histopathology after 36-weeks of treatment with LPCN 1144 in adult males and agreed that the proposed multicomponent primary surrogate endpoint is acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also recommended either conducting a separate dose–ranging study prior to phase 3 or evaluating multiple doses in phase 3. The FDA agreed that the proposed primary multicomponent surrogate endpoint, NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, is acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval pathway and the FDA recommended a phase 3 trial with a study duration of 72 weeks. The FDA has requested that Lipocine submit an updated Phase 3 protocol for FDA feedback on the study design and our next step will be to request an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting to discuss the phase 3 and confirmatory trial designs, including the plan for reading liver histopathology.

We are exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1144 to a third party, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on acceptable terms.
 
TLANDO: An Oral Product Candidate for Testosterone Replacement Therapy
 
As previously described, under the Antares License Agreement, we granted to Antares an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize, upon final approval of TLANDO from the FDA, our TLANDO product for TRT in the U.S. Prior to entering into the Antares License Agreement on December 8, 2020, we received tentative approval from the FDA regarding our NDA filed in February 2020 for TLANDO as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. In granting tentative approval, the FDA concluded that TLANDO has met all required quality, safety and efficacy standards necessary for approval. However, TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval to market in the U.S. until the expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus with respect to Jatenzo®, which expires on March 27, 2022. The FDA has affirmed to Antares the acceptance of the resubmission of the NDA for TLANDO. The FDA has designated the NDA as a Class 1 resubmission with a two-month review goal period and set a target action date of March 28, 2022, under the PDUFA. Any FDA requirement to conduct certain post-marketing studies will also be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares.
 
Proof-of-concept for TLANDO was initially established in 2006, and subsequently TLANDO was licensed in 2009 to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which was then acquired by Abbott Products, Inc. (“Abbott”). Following a portfolio review associated with the spin-off of AbbVie Inc. by Abbott in 2011, the rights to TLANDO were reacquired by us. All obligations under the prior license agreement have been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual 1% royalty on net sales. Such royalties are limited to $1 million in the first two calendar years following product launch, after which period there is not a cap on royalties and no maximum aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties are reduced by 50%.
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), if TLANDO receives full approval, under the terms of the Antares Licensing Agreement, Antares will need to address the PREA requirement to assess the safety and effectiveness of TLANDO in pediatric patients. The FDA may also require certain post-marketing studies to be conducted which will also be the responsibility of our licensee, Antares.
 
Upon execution of the Antares License Agreement, Antares paid to us an initial payment of $11.0 million. Antares will also make additional payments of $5.0 million to us on each of January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $160.0 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain sales milestones in a single calendar year with respect to all products licensed by Antares under the Antares License Agreement. In addition, upon commercialization, we will receive tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from percentages in the mid-teens to up to 20% of net sales of TLANDO in the United States, subject to certain minimum royalty obligations. Further, on October 14, 2021, we assigned our Manufacturing Agreement, dated August 27, 2013, by and between the Company and Encap Drug Delivery (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to Antares as part of the Antares License Agreement.
 
LPCN 1111: A Next-Generation Long-Acting Oral Product Candidate for TRT
 
LPCN 1111: is a next-generation, novel ester prodrug of testosterone comprised of testosterone tridecanoate (TT) which uses the proprietary delivery technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. We completed a Phase 2b dose finding study in hypogonadal men in the third quarter of 2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 2b clinical study were to determine the starting Phase 3 dose of LPCN 1111 along with safety and tolerability of LPCN 1111 and its metabolites following oral administration of single and multiple doses in hypogonadal men. Good dose-response relationship was observed over the tested dose range in the Phase 2b study. Additionally, the target Phase 3 dose met primary and secondary end points. Overall, LPCN 1111 was well tolerated with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events reported in the Phase 2b study.
 
In February 2018 we had a meeting with the FDA to discuss these pre-clinical results and to discuss the Phase 3 clinical study and path forward for LPCN 1111. Based on the results of the FDA meeting and additional pre-clinical studies conducted after the FDA meeting, we have proposed a Phase 3 protocol for LPCN 1111 and have solicited FDA feedback. Based on initial FDA feedback, we expect the Phase 3 clinical trial design to follow the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines and will include at least a three-month efficacy treatment period and a one-year safety component for approximately 100 subjects. We are currently seeking further clarification from FDA with respect to the total subject LPCN 1111 exposure information needed for an NDA filing. We continue to refine the Phase 3 protocol and plan to request FDA approval of the protocol once it is finalized. Additionally, the FDA previously requested that a food effect and a phlebotomy study be completed, and that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (“ABPM”) be included as part of the Phase 3 clinical study. We are currently transferring the manufacturing of LPCN 1111 to a third-party contract manufacturer and scaling up the formulation after which we anticipate the next steps in developing LPCN 1111 may be to conduct a food effect/phlebotomy study with LPCN 1111. Under the terms of the Antares License Agreement, Antares has been granted an option to license LPCN 1111, exercisable on or before March 31, 2022, for further development and, should LPCN 1111 receive FDA approval, commercialization. If Antares exercises its option to license LPCN 1111, we will be entitled to an additional payment of $4.0 million, as well as development milestone payments of up to $35.0 million in the aggregate and tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from percentages in the mid-teens to 20% of net sales of LPCN 1111 in the United States.

LPCN 1107: An Oral Product Candidate for the Prevention of Preterm Birth
 
We believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”) product indicated for the reduction of risk of PTB (delivery less than 37 weeks) in women with singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous PTB. Prevention of PTB is a significant unmet need as approximately 11.7% of all U.S. pregnancies result in PTB, a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity.
Current Status
 
We have completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose PK study in pregnant women with three dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the IM HPC (Makena®). The study enrolled 12 healthy pregnant women (average age of 27 years) with a gestational age of approximately 16 to 19 weeks. Subjects received three dose levels of LPCN 1107 (400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, or 800 mg BID) in a randomized, crossover manner during the first three treatment periods and then received five weekly injections of HPC during the fourth treatment period. During each of the LPCN 1107 treatment periods, subjects received a single dose of LPCN 1107 on Day 1 followed by twice daily administration from Day 2 to Day 8. Following completion of the three LPCN 1107 treatment periods and a washout period, all subjects received five weekly injections of HPC. Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (Cavg0-24) were comparable or higher for all three LPCN 1107 doses than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the three LPCN 1107 doses. Also, unlike the injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all three LPCN 1107 doses within seven days.
 
A traditional PK/PD based Phase 2 clinical study in the intended patient population is not expected to be required prior to entering into Phase 3. Therefore, based on the results of our multi-dose PK study we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting and subsequent guidance meetings with the FDA to define a pivotal Phase 2b/3 development plan for LPCN 1107. However, these discussions will need to be updated based on recent developments with Covis’ Makena®. We plan to resume our interactions with the FDA to discuss our pivotal clinical trial design and better understand next steps to advance LPCN 1107 after completion of our on-going food-effect study.
 
We are exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1107 to a third party, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on acceptable terms.
 
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user fee when we file our NDA.
 
Recent Competition Update
 
On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use.
 
CDER issued AMAG Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder at the time, a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of Makena’s treatment and the public health implications of withdrawing approval. The FDA Commissioner has recently granted Covis a public hearing although the date of that hearing is not publicly known. During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena will remain on the market until the FDA makes a final decision about these products.
 
Currently, Makena and the approved generics of Makena are the only products approved for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth.
 
The FDA also indicated that it intends to hold a meeting with experts in obstetrics, neonatal care, and clinical trial design to discuss how to facilitate development of effective and safe therapies to treat preterm birth.

Oral NAS Programs for CNS Disorders
 
Some preferred endogenous or naturally occurring NAS present in central nervous system (CNS) act as positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of the GABAA receptor, the major biological target of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA). To improve oral delivery of these modulators, several synthetic NAS derivatives of endogenous GABAA receptor PAMs, have been developed for therapeutic use in the past few decades.
 
We believe through utilization of our proprietary technology we may have the ability to enable effective oral delivery of endogenous GABAA receptor PAMs which historically had been challenging to deliver orally as they were deemed to be not orally bioavailable. We believe these endogenous GABAA receptor PAMs provide opportunity as a differentiated NAS for treatment of various CNS disorders via the preferred and convenient oral route.
 
LPCN 1154: Product Candidate for PPD
 
We are currently evaluating LPCN 1154 comprising an endogenous NAS for PPD. FDA has cleared LPCN 1154 IND (investigational new drug) application to conduct a phase 2 study in PPD. We have completed a PK study with LPCN 1154 post oral administration in which appreciable levels were observed with dose proportionality. We plan to conduct further PK analyses and a food effect PK study.
 
PPD
 
PPD (Postpartum depression), a type of major depressive disorder with onset either during pregnancy or within four weeks of delivery, refers to depression persisting up to 12 months after childbirth. PPD can be clinically segmented by the severity of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity, including epilepsy. Approximately 1 in 9 mothers suffers from PPD in the United States alone; this equates to approximately 500,000 women affected by PPD annually.
Disease Overview - PPD
 

● | PPD is distinct from the “baby blues,” a condition that affects up to 70% of all new mother’s experience; “baby blues” tend to be short-lived emotional conditions that do not interfere with daily activities 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Symptoms of PPD include hallmarks of major depression, including, but not limited to, sadness, depressed mood, loss of interest, change in appetite, insomnia, sleeping too much, fatigue, difficulty thinking/concentrating, excessive crying, fear of harming the baby/oneself, and/or thoughts of death or suicide 
● | During pregnancy, levels of endogenous NAS increase considerably along with levels of progesterone; however, they drop sharply postpartum. It has been hypothesized that the rapid perinatal decrease in circulating levels of endogenous NASs may be involved in the development of PPD. The first and only approved treatment option for PPD is an injectable containing endogenous NAS. 
● | Depression may persist long after child delivery. Additionally, approximately 40% women relapse in subsequent pregnancies or on other occasions 
● | Psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy are at high risk for major depressive disorders and PPD. Reported PPD rates are higher among women with epilepsy than the general population.

Associated Risk Factors
 

● | Genetic: family history and/or previous experience of depression or other mood disorders 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Physiological: rapid changes in sex hormones, stress hormones, and thyroid hormone levels during and after delivery 
● | Environmental: stressful life events, changes in relationships at home and at work, and/or lack of familial support 

 
Unmet medical need
 
Approximately, 1 in 9 moms suffers from PPD in the United States alone, which equates to approximately 500,000 women affected by PPD annually. We believe there is considerable unmet need within women with PPD due to lack of convenient and fast-acting oral therapies. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) have been the traditional first-line choice for women with severe PPD requiring weeks for onset of efficacy; therefore, a need for a faster onset of action remains a significant unmet need in treating PPD, especially in women with epilepsy risk wherein psychiatric comorbidity is common and PPD rates are higher than the general population.
 
Injectable brexanolone (ZulressoTM, Sage Therapeutics) became the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression. However, numerous factors limit the utilization of injectable brexanolone such as method of administration, cost, and safety concerns. Administration of injectable brexanolone requires a 60-hour continuous infusion in a supervised medical setting, a demanding ask for a mother with a newborn. Besides associated privacy concerns and social stigma, hospitalization may also require separation of the mother and child for a few days, which may be difficult to the already strained mother-infant bond and may present breast feeding challenges. Moreover, the pharmacotherapy costs coupled with hospitalization/childcare costs limits its accessibility and affordability to women most in need of the therapy. Finally, due to concerns about the safety of injectable ZulressoTM including excessive sedation or loss of consciousness, Zulresso has a Black Box Warning in its label and is only available through a restricted distribution program (REMS), and sites need significant time to become treatment ready.
 
We believe the need for a convenient, at-home treatment with faster onset of action which could offer privacy and affordability, independent of socio-economic status, for women with PPD is a significant unmet need. LPCN 1154 targets this unmet need with affordable NAS.
 
LPCN 2101: NAS for epilepsy
 
We are currently evaluating an additional NAS candidate, LPCN 2101, for women with epilepsy (“WWE”). We have completed a pre-clinical study for LPCN 2101. We plan to file an IND with the U.S. FDA for LPCN 2101 to conduct a proof-of-concept study for the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy in adult female subjects of childbearing age diagnosed with epilepsy.

Research and Development
 
As disclosed in our development pipeline, we continue to build a diversified multi-asset pipeline of novel therapies. In 2021 and 2020, we spent $7.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, on research and development.
Competition
 
Cirrhosis Market Overview 
 
Decompensated cirrhosis patients with sarcopenia exhibit significantly shorter overall survival than those without sarcopenia. There are no therapies specifically approved for sarcopenia or decompensated cirrhosis. Currently, the only curative therapy for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplant; however, liver transplantation is very costly, limited by the supply of available donors, and has a high risk of post-operative complications.
 
Xifaxan (rifaximin) is the only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults, a decompensation event typically associated with liver cirrhosis.
 
Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs to treat secondary sarcopenia in decompensated cirrhosis beyond treatment of the underlying conditions. Lipocine is the only clinical-stage company pursuing treatment for subjects with decompensated cirrhosis with sarcopenia, however there are candidates known to be under development for cirrhosis related indication(s).
 
GB 1211 (by Galecto), an oral galectin-3 inhibitor for advanced liver cirrhosis targeted for directly addressing fibrosis, is in phase 2 development being assessed in patients with moderate-to-severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C) and is anticipated to read out in the second half of 2022.
 
AXA-1665 (by Axcella Health), an orally active mixture of 8 amino acids in specific ratios designed to maximize anabolic activity and minimize ammonia genesis, is in a Phase 2 study in the secondary prevention of overt HE with a projected completion date of March 2023. While AXA-1665’s studies have so far enrolled non-sarcopenic patients, Axcella could pursue cirrhotic sarcopenia with AXA-1665.
 
Reformulated Rifaximin SSD (by BAUSCH health) is in a phase 3 study for Reduction of Early Decompensation in Cirrhosis with time to first occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy as the Primary endpoint. Reportedly, a new drug application (NDA) planned to be submitted 2026.

NASH Market Overview
 
There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH. However, various therapeutics are used off-label for the treatment of NASH, including vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone), antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and ursodeoxycholic acid. There are several product candidates in Phase 3 or earlier clinical or preclinical development for the treatment of NASH, including FGF21 stimulants such as BIO89-100 (89bio), Efruxifermin (EFX; Akero Therapeutics), Pegbelfermin (Bristol Myers Squibb/Ambrx Inc.); FGF19 Analog:Aldafermin (NGM Biopharmaceuticals); FXR Agonists: Tropifexor (Novartis), EDP-305 (Enata Pharmaceuticals), PXL007/EYP001 (Poxel/Enyo Pharma:) Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Agonist: Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk); Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor (PPAR) Regulator: Lanifibranor (Inventiva);THR-β Agonis:t VK2809 (Viking Therapeutics), and Resmetirom (Madrigal Pharmaceuticals).
 
Additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of NASH include AstraZeneca plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., Durect Corporation, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Immuron Ltd., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Islet Sciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., MiNA Therapeutics, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S, NuSirt Sciences Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.
 
Testosterone Replacement Therapy Market Overview
 
The gel-based testosterone replacement products that are currently available include AbbVie’s AndroGel®, Lilly’s Axiron® Topical Solution and Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® along with their respective authorized generics as well as the equivalent generic versions of each. Transdermal patches include Allergan’s Androderm®. Intramuscular forms of testosterone also exist although commercialized mostly in generic forms by multiple companies and in branded form as Aveed® by Endo. Additionally, Endo markets the buccal testosterone replacement therapy Striant® and the Testopel® implantable testosterone pellets, which it acquired from Auxillium in 2015. Antares Pharma, Inc. markets a sub-cutaneous weekly auto-injector testosterone therapy, Xyoste®. Acerus Pharmaceuticals markets an intranasal testosterone therapy, NATESTO®. Finally, Clarus markets an oral TRT, JATENZO®, which received approval in March 2019.
 
Currently, intramuscular injections have the highest market share in the testosterone replacement market in terms of annual prescriptions. While gels are also a widely used form of TRT, there is a risk of transference; additionally, the gels are messy to apply and have significant compliance issues leading to high rates of discontinuance among patients. Additionally, certain intramuscular injections have the potential to cause pulmonary embolisms as well as cause injection site reactions, scarring, pain and risk of infection in patients. We believe a safe and effective oral therapy could potentially increase patient convenience and compliance, while eliminating the testosterone transference risk associated with gels and injection site reaction of injectables.

The FDA has granted a therapeutic equivalence rating of AB to “generic” versions of approved products which have been approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA. In July 2014, FDA granted the AB rating to Perrigo’s 1% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 203098) approved in January 2013, and a BX rating to Teva’s 1% gel drug product (NDA 202763) approved in February 2012. Each are versions of AbbVie’s AndroGel 1.0% and employed 505(b)(2) submissions citing AndroGel as their reference listed drugs. Teva’s version was found to be bioinequivalent to AndroGel, hence the BX rating. Upsher-Smith Laboratories also received approval for a version of Endo’s Testim (Vogelxo™; NDA 204399) in June 2014 using the same pathway. In January of 2015, the FDA determined that Vogelxo™ is therapeutically equivalent to Testim and received an AB rating. In August 2015, the FDA granted AB rating to Perrigo’s 1.62% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 204268) which also received FDA approval in August 2015. Lilly and Acrux’s Axiron had patent expiry in February 2017. On July 6, 2017, Acrux confirmed that a generic version of Axiron® Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL (Testosterone Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL) has been launched in the United States by Perrigo Company plc. Acrux also confirmed the availability of an authorized generic version of Axiron in the United States, through a marketing and distribution agreement between Lilly and Company and a leading authorized generics company
 
Other TRT Therapies in Development 
 
Recently there has been increased interest in developing oral TRT’s therapies as well as testosterone therapies which are not considered testosterone replacement and as such will need to achieve efficacy endpoints in addition to endpoints related to serum testosterone levels that are required for testosterone replacement therapies.
 
Marius is developing an oral TU as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men as well as in the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty in adolescent boys (14-17 years of age). Marinus submitted a NDA to the FDA in January 2021 for its product, Kyzatrex™, its novel oral TU soft gelatin capsule for the treatment of hypogonadism in adult men. According to Marius, it was assigned a PDUFA date of October 31, 2021, for KYZATREX®. However, no updates have been provided by Marius post the October 31, 2021, PDUFA date for KYZATREX®.
 
We believe there remains a significant unmet need in TRT for a once-a-day convenient oral option. LPCN 1111 is targeted to meet this unmet need.
 
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, or HPC, Preterm Birth, or PTB, Market Overview 
 
PTB is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. The only approved therapy for prevention of PTB in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth (approximately 180,000 pregnancies annually) is a weekly intramuscular injection of HPC, marketed by Covis under the brand name Makena®. The FDA granted a 7-year orphan drug exclusivity to Makena in February 2011 because the product is intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States; exclusivity expired in February 2018. Generic versions of the intramuscular injection of Makena became available during 2018. In order to protect market share, Covis also developed a subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena that received FDA approval on February 14, 2018. Treatment with Makena is initiated in pregnant women between week 16 and week 20 of pregnancy and is continued until up to delivery or week 37, whichever is earlier. The intramuscular injection is administered by a healthcare provider using a 21-gauge needle into the gluteus muscle, alternating sides each week. The intramuscular injections are associated with significant pain, discomfort and associated injection site reactions. The subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena eliminates the need to travel weekly to a healthcare provider to have the injection administered. Covis has disclosed that the completed confirmatory trial for Makena did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints of reducing the risk of recurrent preterm birth or improving neonatal mortality and morbidity. On October 29, 2019 a Meeting of the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“BRUDAC”) was held to consider the trial’s findings and the sNDA in the context of AMAG Pharmaceuticals’ confirmatory study obligation. While the committee discussed multiple questions, in a mixed vote on the key question, nine advisory committee members voted to recommend that the FDA pursue withdrawal of approval for Makena and seven committee members voted to leave the product on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial. Among the clinicians on the advisory committee, five of the six who practice obstetrics voted to keep Makena on the market and generate more data. On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s CDER proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use.

CDER issued AMAG, the NDA holder at the time, a NOOH to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of Makena’s treatment and the public health implications of withdrawing approval. The FDA Commissioner granted a hearing, and the process is expected to take months. During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena will remain on the market until the FDA makes a final decision about these products.
 
Neuroactive Steroids Market overview
 
The unique potential mechanism of action (MOA) of NAS presents an opportunity to treat variety of CNS disorders. Accordingly, multiple NAS as GABAA receptor PAMs are in active development for varied indications. Some companies engaged in development include SAGE Therapeutics, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Praxis Precision Medicines, and Eliem Therapeutics.

Additionally, we have 6 U.S. patents that we plan to list in the FDA Orange Book for TLANDO that are expected to expire in 2029 and 2030. If we or our licensee are marketing the TLANDO product at the time the patents expire and have no other issued U.S. patents covering the product, then we will lose certain advantages that come with FDA Orange Book listing of patents and will no longer be able to prevent others in the U.S. from practicing the inventions claimed by the 6 patents.
 
We expect to file new patent applications in the future in an attempt to further cover to various aspects of our products and product development.
 
See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, for a discussion of intellectual property related legal proceedings.
 
Government Regulation 
 
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development 
 
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drugs and products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable law requires licensing and registration of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices, or GLP, good clinical practices, or GCP, during clinical testing and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, during production is required. The system of new drug approval in the United States is generally considered to be the most rigorous in the world and is described in further detail below under “United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process.”
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The testing, production, sale, and promotion of pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
It takes many years for a typical experimental drug to go from concept to approval. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies. The latter often conducted according to GLPs or other applicable regulations, as well as synthesis and drug formulation development leading ultimately to clinical drug supplies manufactured according to cGMPs; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product; 


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and FDA approval is inherently uncertain.
 
Preclinical Studies: Prior to preclinical studies, a research phase takes place which involves demonstration of target and function, design, screening and synthesis of agonists or antagonists. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, PKs and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. The conduct of the preclinical safety evaluations must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The results of the formal IND-enabling preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature as well as the comprehensive descriptions of proposed human clinical studies, are then submitted as part of the IND application to the FDA.

The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
 
Clinical Trials: Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: Phase 1 clinical trials are usually first-in-man trials, take approximately one to two years to complete and are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug’s activity, schedule and dose, PKs and pharmacodynamics. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: Phase 2 clinical trials can take approximately one to three years to complete and are carried out on a relatively small to moderate number of patients (as compared to Phase 3) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, PKs, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. This phase also provides additional safety data and serves to identify possible common short-term side effects and risks in a larger group of patients. Phase 2 clinical trials sometimes include randomization of patients.
 
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Phase 3 clinical trials take approximately two to five years to complete and involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies usually include randomization of patients and blinding of both patients and investigators at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials). These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process 
 
New Drug Application: Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission or application is then reviewed by the regulatory body for approval to market the product. This process typically takes eight months to one year to complete. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Orphan Drug Designation 
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with the FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with the FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law No. 144-255) was enacted on December 13, 2016. This sweeping legislation makes significant changes to the way that FDA approves new drugs and medical devices. Among other things, the legislation calls on FDA to consider new types of data, such as patient experience data, in its drug approval process. The legislation also permits drug manufacturers to utilize new types of clinical trial designs in order to collect data in the drug approval process. The intent of many of the statute’s provisions are to speed the approval of new drugs and medical devices. Whether the 21st Century Cures Act realizes these goals will depend on the adoption of new FDA regulations, policy guidance and FDA approval practices, many of which the agency has not yet proposed or issued.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including, but not limited, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the United States government, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, our Company, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, among others, must comply with federal healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, healthcare fraud and false statement provisions and data privacy and security provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and any analogous state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (“OBRA”), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”) substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, ACA establishes: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
 
Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including fraud and abuse, privacy and transparency laws.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less-costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.

The United States Orphan Drug Act encourages the development of orphan drugs, which are intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” within the meaning of this Act (i.e., those that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States). The provisions of the Act are intended to stimulate the research, development and approval of products that treat rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation provides a sponsor with several potential benefits: (1) sponsors may be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval of the orphan-designated indication for the drug product; (2) sponsors are granted U.S. tax incentives for clinical research; (3) the FDA’s office of orphan products development coordinates research study design assistance for sponsors of drugs for rare diseases; and (4) grant funding can be obtained to defray costs of qualified clinical testing.
 
Priority Review 
 
Priority Review is a designation for an NDA after it has been submitted to the FDA for review. Reviews for NDAs are designated as either “Standard” or “Priority.” A Standard designation sets the target date for completing all aspects of a review and the FDA taking an action on 90% of applications (i.e., approve or not approve) at 12 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 10 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation sets the target date for the FDA action on 90% of applications at eight months after submission submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 6 months after submission for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation is intended for those products that address unmet medical needs.
Accelerated Approval 
 
Accelerated Approval or Subpart H Approval is a program described in the NDA regulations that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint prior to formal demonstration of patient benefit. A surrogate marker is a measurement intended to substitute for the clinical measurement of interest, usually prolongation of survival in oncology that is considered likely to predict patient benefit. The approval that is granted may be considered a provisional approval with a written commitment to complete clinical studies that formally demonstrate patient benefit.
Related Party Transaction
 
On July 23, 2013, we entered into assignment/license and services agreements with Spriaso, an entity that is majority-owned by Mahesh V. Patel, Gordhan Patel, John W. Higuchi, Dr. William I. Higuchi, and their affiliates. Mahesh V. Patel is our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Higuchi is a member of our Board of Directors and Gordhan Patel and Dr. Higuchi, former Board members, were each members of our Board of Directors at the date the license and agreements were entered into.
 
Under the assignment agreement, we assigned and transferred to Spriaso all of our rights, title and interest in our intellectual property for the cough and cold field. In addition, Spriaso was assigned all rights and obligations under our product development agreement with a co-development partner. In exchange, we would be entitled to receive a potential cash royalty of 20% of the net proceeds received by Spriaso, up to a maximum of $10 million. Spriaso also granted back to us an exclusive license to such intellectual property to develop products outside of the cough and cold field. The assignment agreement will expire upon the expiration of all of Spriaso’s payment obligations thereunder and the expiration of all of the licensed patents thereunder. Spriaso has the right to terminate the assignment agreement with 30 days written notice. We have the right to terminate the assignment agreement upon the complete liquidation or dissolution of Spriaso, unless the assignment agreement is assigned to an affiliate or successor of Spriaso.
 
Under the services agreement, we agreed to provide facilities and up to 10% of the services of certain employees to Spriaso for a period of time. The agreement to provide services expired in 2021; however, it may be extended upon written agreement of Spriaso and us. Additionally, Spriaso filed its first NDA in 2014, and as an affiliated entity of Lipocine, it used up the one-time waiver of user fees for a small business submitting its first human drug application to FDA.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 13 full time employees and we also utilize the services of consultants on a regular basis. Eight employees are engaged in drug development activities and five are in general and administration functions and all of our employees work out of our Salt Lake City facility. The Company continually evaluates the business need and opportunity and balances in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and certain drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We strive toward having a diverse team of employees and are committed to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity.
