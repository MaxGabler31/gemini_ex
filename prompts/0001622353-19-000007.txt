 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 General
 We are a commercial real estate company that invests primarily in new or recently-constructed and opened self-storage facilities located predominately in dense urban submarkets within large United States metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”). Facilities in which we invest are largely vertical (three to ten floors), 100% climate controlled and technologically adapted buildings, which we call Generation V facilities. These facilities are located in submarkets with demographic profiles and competitive positions that management believes will support successful lease-up of such facilities and value creation for our stockholders. Our investments include mortgage loans typically coupled with equity interests as well as outright ownership of self-storage facilities.
 Our principal business objective is to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in new Generation V self-storage facilities primarily in urban submarkets. A substantial majority of our investments to date have been first mortgage loans to finance ground-up construction of and conversion of existing buildings into new Generation V self-storage facilities. These investments, which we refer to as “development property investments,” are structured as loans equal to between 90% and 97% of facility costs (including land, pre-development and other “soft” costs, hard construction costs, fees and interest and operating reserves). We receive a fixed rate of interest on loaned amounts and up to a 49.9% interest in the positive cash flows from operations, sales and/or refinancings of self-storage facilities, which we refer to as “Profits Interest”. We also typically receive a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) to acquire the self-storage facility upon sale.
 Additionally, in March 2018 we closed a bridge financing investment consisting of five separate loans with an aggregate commitment amount of $83.3 million secured by first mortgages with equity participations and ROFRs on five self-storage properties in the Miami, Florida MSA that are in lease-up. We refer to this investment herein as a “Bridge Investment.” We have also selectively made construction loans and mortgage loans secured by mature operating self-storage facilities. 
     In addition to the foregoing, we intend to acquire self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our investment counterparties, subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired the 50.1% equity interests of our developer partners in the limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that own our Jacksonville 1, Atlanta 1, Atlanta 2, Pittsburgh, Charlotte 1, and New York City 1 development properties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired the 50.1% equity interests of our developer partner in the LLCs that own our Orlando 1 and Orlando 2 development property investments, which are two self-storage facilities adjacent to each other. We now own 100% of the membership interests in the LLCs that own these seven facilities and fully consolidate these facilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
     We account for our development property investments and bridge investments at fair value, with appreciation and depreciation in the value of these investments being reflected in the carrying value of the assets and in the determination of net income. In determining fair value, we re-value each development property investment and bridge investment each quarter, which re-valuation includes an analysis of the current value of any Profits Interest associated with the investment. We believe that carrying our assets at fair value and reflecting appreciation and depreciation in our earnings provide our stockholders and others who rely on our financial statements with a more complete and accurate understanding of our financial condition and economic performance, including revenues and the creation of value through our Profits Interests as self-storage facilities we finance are constructed, leased-up and become stabilized.
     We generally fund our on-balance sheet investments with (i) proceeds from sales of our securities, including sales of our common stock and our 7.00% cumulative redeemable Series B preferred stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) in follow-on offerings and pursuant to our common stock at-the-market offering program (“ATM Program”) and our Series B Preferred Stock at-the-market offering program (the “Preferred ATM Program”), (ii) funds from secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our $235 million revolving credit facility with KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as lead arranger and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Facility”) and term loans on individual properties, and (iii) net

proceeds from the monetization of existing development property investments. In the past we also have used proceeds from the sale of senior participations and the sale of our Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between us and funds managed by Highland Capital Management, L.P., pursuant to which we issued $125 million of Series A Preferred Stock.
     On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) of Storage Lenders LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, to form a real estate venture (the “SL1 Venture”) with HVP III Storage Lenders Investor, LLC (“HVP III”), an investment vehicle managed by Heitman Capital Management LLC (“Heitman”). The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments with an aggregate commitment amount of $41.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight additional development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million as of December 31, 2018.
     We are externally managed and advised by JCAP Advisors, LLC. The Manager is led by our founder and Executive Chairman, Dean Jernigan, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), John A. Good, and our President and Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”), Jonathan Perry. Mr. Jernigan is a 30‑year veteran of the self-storage industry, including a combined 16 years as the Chief Executive Officer of Storage USA and CubeSmart, both New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed self-storage REITs. During his time at these two companies, Mr. Jernigan oversaw the investment of several billion dollars of capital in the self-storage industry. Mr. Good has over 30 years of experience working with senior management teams and boards of directors of public companies in the REIT and financial services industries on corporate finance, corporate governance, merger and acquisition, tax, executive compensation, joint venture, and strategic planning projects as a nationally recognized corporate and securities lawyer. Prior to joining the Company, he served as lead counsel on over 200 securities offerings, including our IPO, raising in excess of $25 billion over the past 25 years, with more than 125 of those deals being in the REIT industry. Mr. Perry has over 20 years of experience in the self-storage sector having joined the Company in June 2018 from CubeSmart, where he most recently served as Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Mr. Perry has led several billion dollars of self-storage investments and transactions over his career and has established extensive relationships across the industry. We believe the industry experience and depth of relationships of our senior management team and other investment professionals provide us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing, evaluating, underwriting and servicing self-storage investments.
     We are a Maryland corporation that was organized on October 1, 2014 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with certain other requirements for qualification as a REIT set forth in the Code. We are structured as an UPREIT and conduct our investment activities through our Operating Company. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“the 1940 Act”).
     Investment Strategy
     We target investments in self-storage facilities primarily in the top 50 United States MSAs as delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. We believe attractive investment opportunities currently exist in these markets due to:
· | consistently strong long-term self-storage industry fundamentals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased movement (especially by millennials) into smaller dwelling units in larger urban areas, creating additional demand for self-storage units;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased focus on development and construction of new Generation V self-storage facilities in urban submarkets by entrepreneurial developers who desire to refinance or sell such facilities prior to stabilization; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reluctance of commercial banks and other capital providers to finance self-storage construction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We seek to directly originate and structure our target investments utilizing the contacts and self-storage knowledge and experience of our Manager’s personnel, which enables us to: (1) originate broad and adaptable investments that meet the specific needs of our customers and meet our requirements for qualification as a REIT and exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act; (2) have direct access to project developers and enhance our underwriting, structuring and due diligence processes; (3) provide meaningful insight to our customers’ pro forma capital structures, construction budgets, projections and operational decisions; and (4) earn structuring and origination

fees. We believe that our industry knowledge and direct, active engagement with project developers allow us to better monitor investment performance and reduce the risk of loss of principal on our investments.
     From time to time, we purchase developers’ interests in the development properties in which we have co-invested. Generally, our development property investment documents require that self-storage facilities we finance be operated for two years following opening before the developers can market and sell such facilities to third parties; however, during that two-year timeframe, our developer partners may seek to sell their interests to us. At such time, we are free to accept, reject and/or negotiate any such offer. We have not typically initiated these transactions; rather, such a buy-out transaction is usually initiated by the developer. To date, developers of seven projects have sold their interests to us in such privately negotiated transactions.  
     In addition, we possess a ROFR to purchase the underlying self-storage facility in the majority of our development property investments and all of our bridge investments. Our ROFR is typically triggered when the owner of a self-storage facility obtains from an unrelated third party a firm offer for the purchase of the facility that such owner desires to accept. After receipt of notice of such offer, we typically have 10 to 15 business days to exercise our right to purchase the project at the price and on the terms set forth in the bona fide third party offer. Following our exercise of our ROFR, we typically have a 20 to 30 business day inspection period, and we may cancel our exercise of our ROFR prior to the end of such inspection period. After expiration of the inspection period, we will close the purchase of the self-storage facility. Our out-of-pocket funds to close the purchase of a facility acquired by our exercise of our ROFR will typically be the contract purchase price less mortgage debt and less any Profits Interest we have with respect to the facility. In a situation where we continue to hold the debt on the facility, our out-of-pocket funds to close would typically be approximately equal to the owner’s equity and share of profit on the sale of the facility. We expect to exercise ROFRs to purchase self-storage facilities we have financed, subject to our ability to obtain financing.
 The majority of investments we originate are in principal amounts ranging from $5 million to $15 million.
 Target Investments
 We focus primarily on originating the following types of investments:

· | Development Property Investments: These investments are intended to finance ground-up construction of self-storage facilities or major self-storage conversion or redevelopment opportunities generally in the top 50 MSAs. These investments are typically funded over a 12 to 30 month period as the developer completes the project. After an initial advance at closing, typically between a nominal amount and 5% to 10% of our committed investment, funding of construction draws typically commences 90 to 120 days following the loan closing, subject to the timing of building permits, which sometimes take up to 180 days or more following closing. Our development investments typically have been structured as first mortgage loans on the development projects, generally with terms of 72 months, interest-only at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, and provide us with 49.9% Profits Interests in the property-owning entities, entitling us to 49.9% of residual cash flows (including sale and refinancing proceeds after debt repayment). We generally provide between 90% and 97% of the cost to develop and construct new development projects, with cost being inclusive of land acquisition, design and other soft costs, hard costs, a developer’s fee and operating and interest reserves designed to fund the project until it is earning enough cash flow to cover all costs, including interest on our investment. As of December 31, 2018, one of our development property investments totaling $9.3 million of aggregate committed amount was structured as a preferred equity investment which will be subordinate to a first mortgage loan expected to be procured from a third party lender for 60% to 70% of the cost of the project. We may make additional preferred equity investments such as this in the future.

· | Wholly-Owned Property Investments: In connection with our development property investments and bridge investments, we have typically received ROFRs to acquire the self-storage facilities underlying our investments. Subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders, we intend to acquire self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our investment counterparties. Our development property investment documents generally require that the developer operate the facility for two years after it opens for business prior to marketing and selling the property to a third-party; however, during that two-year timeframe, our developer partner may seek to sell its interest in a project to us. In 2017, we acquired the interests of our developer partner in our Orlando 1 and Orlando 2 development property investments, after our developer partner offered to sell us his remaining membership interests in the LLCs that owned the projects. In 2018, we acquired the 50.1% equity interests of our developer partners in our Jacksonville 1, Atlanta 1, Atlanta 2, Pittsburgh, Charlotte 1, and New York City 1 development property investments, after our developer partners offered to sell us their remaining membership interests in the LLCs that owned those projects.

properties are, and we expect that for the foreseeable future they will be, managed by third-party professional managers. See “—Operations Strategy—Property Management and Operations.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bridge Investments: These investments are intended to recapitalize existing Generation V facilities that are in lease-up. Proceeds from our bridge investments are for the purpose of repaying existing construction loans, returning equity to capital partners and/or funding operating losses and interest payments during lease-up. Our existing bridge investments (i) are secured by a first mortgage on the financed asset(s); (ii) have terms of 5 to 7 years; (iii) bear interest at fixed rates, with the rate depending on any given bridge investment being determined based on the stage of lease-up of the financed self-storage facility; (iv) contain an equity participation; and (v) are coupled with a ROFR to acquire the financed self-storage facility. Our bridge investments are highly structured transactions designed to meet certain capital needs of the facility or its sponsor; accordingly, future bridge investments may take different forms and structures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition to our primary focus, we occasionally and selectively will originate land loans and credit lines to facilitate a development property investment. These loans are intended for borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition, refinancing, recapitalization or repositioning of a given facility, portfolio or partnership interest or pursuit of development sites. These loans typically have maturities of three years or less. We will provide land loans only if secured by a first mortgage on a self-storage site that has proper zoning and an acceptable environmental condition and only to borrowers who intend to refinance such land loans with development investments made by us. These loans have been, and we expect them to continue to be, an insignificant part of our business. These loans are accounted for at historical cost and are not subject to fair value adjustments.
 The following table summarizes certain targeted characteristics of our development property investment and bridge investment portfolio:
    
 | | Loan-to-Cost ("LTC")/ | Average | | | Right of
 | | Loan-to-Value ("LTV") | Term | | Profits | First

  Investment Activity
     Overview of total investment activity
     As of December 31, 2018, our self-storage investment portfolio consists of seven wholly-owned self-storage facilities, 46 on-balance sheet development property investments with a Profits Interest (20 of which are secured by facilities in lease-up and 26 of which are secured by facilities under construction), 11 development property investments with a profits interest in our SL1 Venture (10 of which are secured by facilities in lease-up and one of which is secured by a facility where construction is substantially complete), and 5 bridge investments secured by facilities that are all in lease-up. We also have one construction loan secured by a facility under construction. 
     On-balance sheet investment activity
     Our on-balance sheet self-storage investments at December 31, 2018 consisted of the following:

· | Development Property Investments - We had 46 investments totaling an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $533.3 million to finance the ground-up construction of, or conversion of existing buildings into, self-storage facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Included in development property investments as of December 31, 2018 was one construction loan with a committed principal amount of approximately $17.7 million that is interest-only at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% annum (default rate of 12.9% annum), has no equity

participation and is secured by a first priority mortgage on the project. This construction loan had an initial term of 18 months that was extended during the first quarter of 2017 and in 2018. This loan matured and became due and payable on June 30, 2018; however, it has yet to be repaid. Accordingly, this construction loan is in default and was placed on non-accrual status during the three months ended December 31, 2018. Since that time, no interest income has been recognized and will only be recognized if interest is collected in cash. The total unpaid balance of the loan is $17.7 million. As the investment is a collateral dependent loan, we considered the fair value of the collateral when determining the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2018 is $17.7 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we commenced proceedings to foreclose on the underlying collateral.
 As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate committed principal amount of our development property investments was approximately $551.0 million and outstanding principal was $332.0 million, as described in more detail in the table below (dollars in thousands):

· | Bridge Investments – We have five separate bridge investments with an aggregate commitment amount of $83.3 million secured by first mortgages on five properties in the Miami, Florida MSA. Three of these bridge investments amounting to an aggregate principal amount of $47.1 million are secured by first priority mortgages on self-storage properties with an aggregate of over 203,000 net rentable square feet that were completed and began lease-up in 2016, which loans bear interest at an annual rate of 6.9%, payable monthly in cash. We have a 49.9% Profits Interest in these three properties. Two of these bridge investments aggregating a principal amount of $36.2 million are secured by first priority mortgages on two recently-completed self-storage properties with an aggregate of over 163,000 net rentable square feet, which loans bear interest at an annual rate of 9.5%, with 6.5% payable monthly in cash and 3.0% PIK interest, accruing and payable upon maturity of the loan. We also have a 49.9% Profits Interest, after the other members of the borrower receive $1.0 million of preferential payments per loan. All five loans mature five years from the date of closing, with the borrower having two extension options for one year each.

      Real estate venture activity
     On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the JV Agreement of Storage Lenders LLC to form SL1 Venture with HVP III, an investment vehicle managed by Heitman. The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida that were not yet under construction. These investments had an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $41.9 million and aggregate drawn balances of $8.1 million (fair value of $7.7 million). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight new development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III and the Company agreed to true up the balances in the respective members’ capital accounts to be in accordance with the 90% commitment and 10% commitment made by HVP III and the Company, respectively. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III contributed cash of $7.3 million to the SL1 Venture, and the Company received a $7.3 million cash distribution as a return of its capital.
 Under the JV Agreement, we received a priority distribution (after debt service and any reserve but before any other distributions) out of operating cash flow and residual distributions based upon 1% of the committed principal amount of loans made by the SL1 Venture, exclusive of the loans contributed to the SL1 Venture by us. Operating cash flow of the SL1 Venture (after debt service, reserves and the foregoing priority distributions) will be distributed in accordance with capital commitments. Residual cash flow from capital and other events (after debt service, reserves and priority distributions) will be distributed (i) pro rata in accordance with capital commitments (its “Percentage Interest”) until each member has received a return of all capital contributed; (ii) pro rata in accordance with each member’s Percentage Interest until Heitman has achieved a 14% internal rate of return; (iii) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 10% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 10% until Heitman has achieved a 17% internal rate of return; (iv) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 20% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 20% until Heitman has achieved a 20% internal rate of return; and (v) any excess to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 30% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 30%. However, we will not be entitled to any such promoted interest prior to the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the JV Agreement and Heitman receiving distributions to the extent necessary to provide Heitman with a 1.48 multiple on its contributed capital.
 Under the JV Agreement, during the pendency of the SL1 Venture, and as long as the SL1 Venture holds any assets, Heitman has the right of first offer to participate in any joint venture or similar program pursued by us on substantially the same terms as those set forth in the JV Agreement. This right of first offer includes any investment of debt or equity or otherwise, directly or indirectly, in one or more new joint ventures or similar programs for the purposes of funding or providing development loans or financing, directly or indirectly, for the development, construction or conversion of self-storage facilities.

      On January 28, 2019, the SL1 Venture purchased 100% of the Class A membership units of the LLCs that owned the Atlanta 1, Jacksonville, Atlanta 2, and Denver development property investments with a Profits Interest for an aggregate purchase price of $12.1 million. These purchases increased the SL1 Venture’s ownership interest on each development property investment from 49.9% to 100%. The SL1 Venture now wholly owns the self-storage properties through these LLCs. On February 27, 2019, the SL1 Venture closed on a $36.1 million term loan secured by these four properties.
         Operations Strategy
     We believe our ability to capitalize on the self-storage industry reputation, relationships, market knowledge and expertise of our management team provides us with substantial benefits in sourcing, underwriting and evaluating attractive investments, executing such investments quickly and effectively, and managing our assets. Under our Management Agreement, our Manager is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, including sourcing and originating investment opportunities, providing underwriting services, processing approvals for all loans, acquisitions and other investments in our portfolio and negotiating the terms of any purchase of an investment counterparty’s interest in a self-storage facility. The Manager has an Investment Committee, currently consisting of Messrs. Jernigan, Good and Perry, that reviews all loans and other investments to determine whether they meet our investment guidelines and are otherwise appropriate for our portfolio. The following is a description of the key elements of our Manager’s business operations:     Investment Origination
     We utilize the self-storage industry knowledge and relationships of our management team to originate a substantial majority of our investments. Seven of the 16 employees of our Manager, including Messrs. Jernigan, Good and Perry, are actively engaged in the origination process. The Manager’s employees leverage contacts with self-storage facility owners, developers, national commercial real estate brokers, commercial mortgage loan brokers, financial institutions and other persons with an active presence in the self-storage industry in the United States seeking investment opportunities. Each employee of the Manager responsible for originating investments has the self-storage industry knowledge, real estate and finance expertise to determine what investment structure best meets the needs of our partner and the optimal structure of a financing

solution. We believe the self-storage industry experience, knowledge and relationships of our management team uniquely position us to significantly grow our investment portfolio.
     Underwriting
     Each of our Manager’s employees who originate investment opportunities evaluates such opportunities in accordance with specific underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures in order to determine suitability for both our partner and our portfolio. Our Manager performs underwriting due diligence on all proposed transactions prior to investment approval and commitment.
     In general, our underwriting guidelines require evaluation of the following factors, as appropriate:
    
· | the character and integrity of the developer/owner of the project;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed ownership structure of the project, the financial strength, real estate and self-storage industry experience of the project principals, background check on principals, third party appraisal, insurance review, and environmental and engineering studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | appropriate sub-market demographics, including population density, average household incomes, percentage of non-subsidized renters, per capita self-storage square footage, competitors and rental rates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | with respect to development projects, the construction budget, required interest reserves, the guaranteed maximum price construction contract, buy-out of subcontractors, zoning and entitlement issues for construction and major redevelopment loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | with respect to existing projects, the construction quality of the self-storage facility to determine future maintenance and capital expenditure requirements, stage of lease-up, quality of management, rental market conditions and prevailing market cap rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels, revenues and expenses in the sub-market, and for existing facilities, as to that facility;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels and expense levels at comparable facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the potential for near term revenue growth and opportunity for expense reduction and increased operating efficiencies; the facility’s location, its attributes and competitive position within its market, existing competition as well as future competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the review of title status and survey;
--+---------------------------------------


· | the requirements for any reserves, including those for immediate repairs or rehabilitation, replacement reserves, real estate taxes and facility casualty and liability insurance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the availability of capital for refinancing by the borrower if a loan does not fully amortize; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the internal rate of return.
--+-----------------------------

      Key factors considered in credit decisions include debt service coverage, LTV and LTC ratios, development yield, debt yield, cash equity remaining in the deal or level of cash out to the borrower, competitive set relative performance, and facility historical and projected operating performance. Key factors considered in decisions to acquire 100% of the interests in a self-storage facility include stage of lease-up, historical cash flows and current run rate cash flows relative to run rate interest income on our development property investment, leasing experience of the facility and the projected stabilized cap rate on our total investment cost. Consideration is also given to other factors such as developer concentration, facility concentration (both by type and location), identification of strategy for ultimate disposition by partner and expected changes in market conditions.
     Investment Approval Process
     Employees of our Manager complete the rigorous underwriting process described above prior to submitting proposals to our Manager’s Investment Committee for final approval. After a proposed investment is underwritten, a detailed written investment memorandum and financial summary is prepared. The memorandum includes a description of the prospective investment counterparty and project, demographic and competitive information about the project, a description of the site and the self-storage facility located or to be located on the site, the proposed use of investment proceeds, and an analysis of favorable investment factors and key risk factors. In addition, the presentation provides net operating income projections, development and investment yields, competitive data and coverage ratios. Where the investment involves an operating property (for example, bridge investments or outright purchases), the memorandum contains information regarding physical condition and operations. Each transaction is presented for approval to our Manager’s Investment Committee, which consists of Messrs. Jernigan, Good and Perry. All transactions require the approval of all members of our Manager’s Investment Committee. In addition, the approval of our Board of Directors is required if more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project.
    
 
  13

 

 Following the approval and closing of any transaction, our Manager’s investment management group provide customary monitoring and servicing to assure that contract terms have been satisfied.
     Investment Processing and Servicing
     We service all of our development property investments, bridge investments and other loans with an internal staff employed by our Manager. Our internal staff is assisted in servicing development property investments, including processing construction draw requests, by a nationally known construction consultant. The responsibilities of our investment management team include:
· | assisting in investment due diligence, documentation and closing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analyzing and processing draw requests;
--+----------------------------------------


· | ensuring that development projects remain free from impermissible liens and encumbrances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | collecting and analyzing project and developer financial information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determining compliance with ongoing covenants;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | collecting interest, fees and principal amounts owed on loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assisting our accounting and finance team in determining the fair value of our investments and ensuring proper accounting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our investment management team utilizes the services of nationally-known independent consultants to inspect projects that are in the construction process and provide guidance with respect to the processing of construction draws.
     Property Management and Operations
     Our developer partners manage the ownership entity for each project they develop; however, we require each self-storage facility that is the subject of a development property investment or bridge investment to be operationally managed by a professional self-storage manager, which we define as a manager who (i) has a presence on the first page of Google in the facility’s market, (ii) runs a professional and adequately staffed call center, and (iii) maintains a state-of-the-art revenue management function staffed by experienced professionals utilizing the most current technology. We also utilize professional self-storage managers for all wholly-owned self-storage facilities. We believe the benefits of professional third-party management include:
· | national branding of the facilities providing enhanced marketing and top tier internet presence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significant economies of scale that reduce operating and G&A expense;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sophisticated revenue management that optimizes profitability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | access to state-of-the-art accounting and information systems that enhance reporting; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continuous exposure to latest management trends and thought leadership in the self-storage sector that benefits the relationships with customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of December 31, 2018, our developer partners in 54 out of our 57 development property investments (including those made by our SL1 Venture) and bridge investments have selected CubeSmart as the third-party manager, one has selected Life Storage and two have selected ExtraSpace Storage. All seven of our wholly-owned facilities are managed by CubeSmart.
     Once a self-storage facility opens for business, we monitor operational data. We are granted full access to the third-party manager’s property accounting system with respect to the self-storage facilities such manager manages for us. Our internal investment management team, consisting of our President and CIO, Senior Vice President of Investment Management, one of our Directors of Operations and our Manager of Portfolio Investments, regularly reviews operating and financial information for our facilities, including property operating budgets, summary rental experience reports, facility leasing dashboards, monthly profit and loss reports and other relevant information. In addition, we have a consulting relationship with the former chief operating officer of a large self-storage REIT pursuant to which he from time to time assists our team in reviewing property operations and makes suggestions for improvements. We share pertinent information with our developers to assist them with solid management practices. We believe that active oversight of property operations is essential to protecting our invested capital, collaborating with our developer partners to optimize profitability, holding our third-party managers accountable for performance and ensuring timely management decisions that maximize the value of our investments.

 Investment Guidelines
     Our Board of Directors has adopted the following general guidelines for our investments and borrowings:
    
· | no investment will be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | no investment will be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project and no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in projects controlled by a single borrower or group of affiliated borrowers that would form a consolidated group under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | over time our average leverage will be in the range of 25% to 35% of our total assets, but we may borrow up to 100% of the principal value of certain development loans secured by first mortgages;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we will maintain a portfolio of geographically diverse assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our Manager must seek the approval of a majority of our independent directors before engaging in any transaction that falls outside of our investment guidelines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      These investment guidelines may be changed or waived by our Board of Directors (which must include a majority of our independent directors) without the approval of our stockholders.
     Management Agreement
     As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any employees. We rely on the personnel, properties and resources of our Manager to conduct our operations. We and our Manager are parties to a management agreement (as amended and restated, the “Management Agreement”), which was originally entered into on April 1, 2015 and was amended and restated on May 23, 2016, April 1, 2017 and November 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager is responsible for (a) our day-to-day operations (including finance, accounting and investor relations), (b) determining investment criteria and strategy in conjunction with our Board of Directors, (c) sourcing, analyzing, originating, underwriting, structuring, and acquiring our portfolio investments, (d) sourcing, analyzing, procuring and managing our capital and (e) performing portfolio management duties. The Manager has an Investment Committee that approves investments in accordance with our investment guidelines, investment strategy, and financing strategy.
 The initial term of the Management Agreement will expire on March 31, 2020, with up to a maximum of three one-year extensions that end on March 31, 2023. Our independent directors will review the Manager’s performance annually. At the end of the initial term and any extension term, the Management Agreement may be terminated upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors if such independent directors determine: (a) the Manager has performed its duties in an unsatisfactory manner that is materially detrimental to the Company; or (b) the compensation payable to the Manager is not fair, subject to the Manager’s right to prevent termination based on unfair compensation by accepting a reduction of compensation agreed to by at least two-thirds of the independent directors. We are required to provide our Manager with a minimum 180 days’ prior notice of such a termination. Upon such a termination, we will pay the Manager a Termination Fee except as provided below in the subsection entitled “Termination of Management Agreement”.
     The Manager may terminate the Management Agreement if the Company becomes required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event, in which case we would not be required to pay the Manager a Termination Fee. The Manager may also decline to renew the Management Agreement by providing the Company with 180 days’ written notice, in which case we would not be required to pay a Termination Fee.
 Management Fees
 Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we pay the Manager a base management fee in an amount equal to 0.375% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity (a 1.5% annual rate) calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, the Company’s stockholder’s equity means: (a) the sum of (i) the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since our IPO (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (ii) our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods); less (b) any amount that we pay to repurchase our common stock since our IPO. If our retained earnings are in a net deficit position (following any required adjustments set forth below), then retained earnings shall not be included in stockholders’ equity. Retained earnings also excludes (x) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and (y) one-time events

pursuant to changes in GAAP (such as a cumulative change to our operating results as a result of a codification change pursuant to GAAP), and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above (such as depreciation and amortization), in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders’ equity for purposes of calculating the base management fee could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown on our financial statements. The base management fee is payable independent of the performance of our portfolio. The Manager computes the base management fee within 30 days after the end of the fiscal quarter with respect to which such installment is payable and promptly delivers such calculation to our Board of Directors. The amount of the installment shown in the calculation is due and payable no later than the date which is five business days after the date of delivery of such computation to the Board of Directors. The base management fee was $6.7 million, $3.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Incentive Fee
 The Manager may also earn an incentive fee each fiscal quarter (or part thereof that the Management Agreement is in effect) payable in arrears in cash. The incentive fee will be an amount, not less than zero, determined pursuant to the following formula:
 Incentive Fee = .20 times (A minus (B times .08)) minus C
 In the foregoing formula:

· | A equals our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12‑month period;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | B equals (i) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of its public offerings of common stock, multiplied by (ii) the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including (i) any restricted stock units and any restricted shares of common stock in the previous 12‑month period and (ii) shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding OC Units); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | C equals the sum of any incentive fees earned by the Manager with respect to the first three fiscal quarters of such previous 12‑month period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Notwithstanding application of the incentive fee formula, any incentive fee earned shall not be paid with respect to any fiscal quarter unless cumulative annual stockholder total return for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters is greater than 8%. Any computed incentive fee earned but not paid because of the foregoing hurdle will accrue until such 8% cumulative annual stockholder total return is achieved. The total return is calculated by adding stock price appreciation (based on the volume-weighted average of the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE (or other applicable trading market) for the last ten consecutive trading days of the applicable computation period minus the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of our common stock for the last ten consecutive trading days of the period immediately preceding the applicable computation period) plus dividends per share paid during such computation period, divided by the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of our common stock for the last ten consecutive trading days of the period immediately preceding the applicable computation period. For purposes of computing the Incentive Fee, “Core Earnings” is defined as (1) net income (loss) determined under GAAP, plus (2) non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization, plus (3) any unrealized losses or other non-cash expense items reflected in GAAP net income (loss), less (4) any unrealized gains reflected in GAAP net income (including any unrealized appreciation with respect to self-storage facilities that we have not yet acquired). The amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of the independent directors. In addition, with respect to any self-storage facility acquired by us with respect to which we had an outstanding loan as of the time of such acquisition, the amount of Core Earnings determined pursuant to the formula above in the period of such acquisition shall also be increased by the difference between (A) the appraised value, as determined by a nationally recognized, independent third-party appraiser mutually agreed to by us and the Manager who has significant expertise in valuing self-storage properties, and (B) (i) the outstanding principal amount of any one of our loans secured by such acquired self-storage facility at the time of such acquisition plus (ii) any other consideration given to the former owner upon such acquisition. This addition is intended to include in Core Earnings the amount of our unrealized gain on account of our acquisition of a self-storage facility without such facility being sold to a third party buyer in the open market. 
     The Manager computes the incentive fee each quarter within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter that is currently payable and if an incentive fee results, promptly delivers such calculation to our Board of Directors. The amount of any incentive fee shown in the calculation is due and payable no later than the date which is five business days after the date of delivery of such computation to the Board of Directors. The 

 
  16

 
incentive fee earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.7 million, is primarily due to the purchases of developer interests in six self-storage projects during the year, and is presented in the Fees to Manager line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. No incentive fee was earned for any quarter in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
     At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding fees due to Manager of $3.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, consisting of the management fees payable, incentive fees payable, and certain reimbursable expenses.
     Expense Reimbursement
     In addition to Management Fees and Incentive Fees as described above, the Management Agreement provides that the Company will reimburse payroll, occupancy, business development, marketing and other expenses of the Manager for conducting the business of the Company, excluding the salaries and cash bonuses of the Manager’s CEO and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), and certain other costs as determined by the Manager in accordance with the Management Agreement. Certain prepaid expenses and fixed assets are also purchased through the Manager and reimbursed by the Company. Under the Management Agreement, the Manager may engage independent contractors that provide investment banking, securities brokerage, mortgage brokerage and other financial, legal and account services as may be required for our investments, and we agree to reimburse the Manager for costs and expenses incurred in connection with these services; however, expenses incurred by the Manager are reimbursable to the Manager by us only to the extent such expenses are not otherwise directly reimbursed by an unaffiliated third party. The amount of expenses to be reimbursed to the Manager by us are reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any such payment or reimbursement. Amounts reimbursable to the Manager for expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and totaled $3.8 million, $3.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Termination of Management Agreement
     In the event that the Company terminates the Management Agreement per the terms of the agreement, other than for cause or the Company being required to register as an investment company, there will be a Termination Fee due to the Manager. If the Management Agreement terminates other than for Cause, voluntary non-renewal by the Manager or the Company being required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, then we shall pay to the Manager, on the date on which such termination is effective, a Termination Fee equal to the greater of (i) three times the sum of the average annual Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee earned by the Manager during the 24‑month period prior to such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination, or (ii) a price, based on the lesser of (a) the Manager’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted for unusual, extraordinary and non-recurring charges and expenses), or “EBITDA”, annualized based on the most recent quarter ended, multiplied by a specific multiple, or EBITDA Multiple, depending on our achieved total annual return, and (b) our equity market capitalization multiplied by a specific percentage, or Capitalization Percentage, depending on our achieved total return (the “Internalization Price”). 
     The EBITDA and Capitalization Percentage are as follows based on our total annual return:
    
Total Annual Return | EBITDA Multiple | Capitalization %
<8% | 5x | 5% 
8% to 12% | 5.5x | 5.5% 
>12% | 6x | 6% 

      Any Termination Fee will be payable by the Operating Company in cash.
     We also may terminate the Management Agreement at any time, including during the initial term, without the payment of any Termination Fee, with 30 days’ prior written notice from the Board of Directors, for cause. “Cause” is defined as: (i) the Manager’s continued breach of any material provision of the Management Agreement following a prescribed period; (ii) the occurrence of certain events with respect to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Manager; (iii) a change of control of the Manager that a majority of our independent directors determines is materially detrimental to us; (iv) the Manager committing fraud against us, misappropriating or embezzling our funds, or acting grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement; (v) the dissolution of the Manager; (vi) the Manager fails to provide adequate or appropriate personnel that are reasonably necessary for the Manager to identify investment opportunities for us and to manage and develop our investment portfolio if such default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof, which notice must contain a request that the same be remedied; (vii) the Manager is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a felony; or 

 
  17

 
(viii) both the current Executive Chairman and the current CEO are no longer senior executive officers of the Manager or us during the term of the Management Agreement other than by reason of death or disability.
 Internalization of Manager
     No later than 180 days prior to the end of the initial term of the Management Agreement, the Manager will offer to contribute to our Operating Company at the end of the initial term all of the assets or equity interests in the Manager (an “Internalization Transaction”). Such offer shall specify an internalization price and such terms and conditions as the Manager shall determine.
     Upon receipt of the Manager’s initial internalization offer, a special committee consisting solely of our independent directors may accept the Manager’s proposal or submit a counter offer to the Manager. If the Manager and the special committee are unable to agree, the Manager and the special committee will repeat this process annually during the term of any extension of the Management Agreement. Acquisition of the Manager pursuant to this process requires a fairness opinion from a nationally recognized investment banking firm and stockholder approval, in addition to approval by the special committee. As described above, if an Internalization Transaction has not occurred prior to March 31, 2023, the last day of the last renewal term, then the Manager and the Company shall consummate an Internalization Transaction to be effective as of that date, and such Internalization Transaction shall not require a fairness opinion, the approval of a special committee of our Board of Directors or the approval of our stockholders.
     Under the Management Agreement, if an Internalization Transaction has not occurred prior to March 31, 2023, the last day of the last renewal term, then the Manager and the Company shall consummate an Internalization Transaction to be effective as of that date and all assets of the Manager (or, alternatively, all of the equity interests in the Manager) shall be conveyed to and acquired by the Operating Company in exchange for the Internalization Price (as described herein). At such time, all employees of the Manager shall become employees of the Operating Company and the Manager shall discontinue all business activities. Unlike an Internalization Transaction that occurs prior to the end of the final renewal term of the Management Agreement, an Internalization Transaction that occurs at the end of the final renewal term shall not require a fairness opinion, the approval of a special committee of our Board of Directors or the approval of our stockholders.
     The “Internalization Price” payable in the event of an Internalization Transaction at the end of the last renewal term shall be equal to the Termination Fee and our Board of Directors has no discretion to change such Internalization Price or the conditions applicable to its payment.
     The Internalization Price paid to the Manager in any Internalization Transaction will be payable by the Operating Company in the number of units of limited liability company interests (“OC Units”) of the Operating Company equal to the Internalization Price, divided by the volume-weighted average of the Company’s closing market price of the common stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date with respect to which value must be determined. However, if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange at the time of closing of any Internalization Transaction, then the number of OC Units shall be determined by agreement between our Board of Directors and the Manager or, in the absence of such agreement, the Internalization Price shall be paid in cash.
     Competition
 Our net income depends, in part, on our ability to make investments and acquire facilities that produce returns at favorable spreads over our cost of capital. In originating or acquiring our target investments, we may compete to a limited degree with other self-storage REITs, primarily including five publicly-traded self-storage REITs (Public Storage, Extra-Space Storage, CubeSmart, Life Storage, Inc. and National Storage Affiliates) as well as several private national self-storage owner-operators, and, with respect to financing transactions, to a greater degree with other commercial mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, such as business development companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 In the face of this competition, we have access to our Manager’s professionals and their self-storage industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. This expertise enables us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Moreover, we believe many 

 
  18

 
traditional institutional investors do not possess the self-storage industry knowledge or experience to appropriately assess the riskiness of investments in self-storage facilities, and, accordingly, such investors may not compete effectively on pricing and terms for self-storage investments our Manager originates. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities”.
 Employees
 We have no employees and are managed by our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. Our Manager currently has 16 employees who provide services to the Company. Our executive officers, comprised of our Executive Chairman, CEO, President and CIO, and Senior Vice President, CFO, Corporate Secretary and Treasurer, are owners and/or employees of our Manager.
 Exemption from Regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the “40% test”). Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company for private funds set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.
 We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly- and/or majority-owned subsidiaries. We conduct our operations so that we and the Operating Company do not hold “investment securities” in excess of the limit imposed by the 40% test. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we have formed or may form in the future that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (as determined under the 1940 Act) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we will not engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, we are and continue to be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries.
 If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) to effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, any of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities, negatively affect our operations, the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and/or our ability to make distributions.
 In 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations.
 Although we monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each investment origination or acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this exemption from registration for these subsidiaries.
 In addition, we, our Operating Company and/or our subsidiaries may rely upon other exclusions, including the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act (which excludes, among other things, parent entities whose primary business is conducted 

 
  19

 
through majority-owned subsidiaries relying upon the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), discussed above), from the definition of an investment company and the registration requirements under the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly.
 We determine whether an entity is one of our majority-owned subsidiaries. The 1940 Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The 1940 Act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the tests described above. We have not requested the SEC to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and the SEC has not done so. If the SEC were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40% test. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us.
 To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exemptions we and our subsidiaries rely on from the 1940 Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen.
