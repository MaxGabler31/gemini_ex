GRANITE updates
 On January 13, 2022, we announced the first patient was enrolled for inclusion in the GRANITE -CRC-1L study, a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating our individualized neoantigen vaccine (GRANITE) for first line (1L) maintenance treatment of metastatic, microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC).
 On January 13, 2022, we also announced updated interim data from the Phase 1/2 GRANITE trial evaluating individualized immunotherapy in combination with nivolumab (OPDIVO®) and ipilimumab (YERVOY®) in patients with advanced solid tumors. As of the January 5, 2022 data cutoff date, 6 out of 12 MSS-CRC patients treated in such GRANITE trial, who were alive at the time of our ESMO 2021 data presentation on September 17, 2021, remained alive, and the correlation between ctDNA and overall survival continued to be observed (Figure 8).
 As of March 2022, the first patient was enrolled for inclusion in the GRANITE–CRC-ADJUVANT study, a randomized, controlled phase 2 trial of adjuvant GRANITE immunotherapy in MSS-CRC patients with stage II/III disease who are ctDNA+ after definitive surgery.
