Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this subsection to “we,” “our,” “Latch” and the “Company” refer to the business and operations of Latch Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Latch, Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to Latch, Inc. (formerly known as TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp.) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination.
Overview
Latch is an enterprise technology company focused on revolutionizing how people experience spaces by making spaces better places to live, work and visit. Latch has created a full-building operating system, LatchOS, which addresses the essential requirements of modern buildings. LatchOS streamlines building operations, enhances the resident experience and enables efficient interactions with service providers. Our product offerings, designed to optimize the resident experience, include smart access, delivery and guest management, smart home and sensors, connectivity and personalization and services. We combine hardware, software and services into a holistic system that makes spaces more enjoyable for residents, more efficient and profitable for building operators and more convenient for service providers.
LatchOS enables spaces across North America, including in 44 states and Canada, from affordable housing in Baltimore, to historic buildings in Manhattan, to luxury towers in the Midwest. Latch works with real estate developers, large and small, ranging from the largest real estate companies in the world to passionate local owners.
We engage with customers early in their new construction or renovation process, helping establish Latch as the technology consultant for the building. LatchOS is made up of modules, enabling essential capabilities for modern buildings. Building owners have the flexibility to select LatchOS modules to match their specific building’s or portfolio’s needs. LatchOS software starting pricing ranges from $7-12 per apartment per month, depending on which capabilities the building owner selects, for the LatchOS Smart Access, Smart Home and Guest Management modules. Customers also purchase our hardware devices to go along with the LatchOS modules they choose.
The LatchOS ecosystem has been created to serve all the stakeholders at a building, and today LatchOS modules consist of the following:
•Smart Access. Latch’s smart access software capabilities include complete resident, building staff, guest, service provider and construction access management powered by the Latch R, M and C devices. These devices serve every door in a building, from apartment doors to elevators, to parking garages to gyms. 
•Delivery & Guest Management. Going beyond smart access, Latch Intercom solves the access problem for unexpected guests and deliveries, enabling visitors to quickly connect with residents or building operators with just a few clicks. The Latch Delivery Assistant takes this solution to the package room with a remote, virtual doorman facilitating secure package management.
•Smart Home & Sensors. Latch’s enterprise device management enables smart home capabilities for thermostat, lighting, leak detection and other sensor integration, monitoring and centralized device management for building owner and private resident control right in the Latch App. The integration of the LatchOS platform with smart home device manufacturers like Google Nest, ecobee, Honeywell, Jasco and more provide our customers with a wide choice in smart home devices that can be controlled through LatchOS.
•Connectivity. Connecting devices, operations and residents reliably to the network across buildings can be complex. Latch Intercom and Latch Hub’s cellular connectivity bring internet access to new and existing building infrastructure from new construction to retrofits.
•Personalization and Services. Residents can control all of the Latch-enabled devices in their spaces through the Latch App from the moment they arrive. Latch’s mobile applications also enable resident onboarding, streamlining the move-in experience. The average Latch App user interacts with the Latch App multiple times per day, giving us a foundation from which to engage and transact further with residents over time as we introduce new functionalities and services to the Latch mobile applications.
After Latch has been installed and set up at a building, the building managers add all their residents as users to the Latch system. Our mobile applications then enable the residents to unlock all connected spaces in Latch buildings from the front 
door, package rooms, common spaces, elevators and garages to their unit entrance, control their thermostat and smart home devices from the app, see who rang the bell at the front door through Latch Intercom and let guests in through the app. In the near future, we believe that Latch has a powerful opportunity to improve the experience of living in a space through new offerings and services in the Latch App. Residents become highly engaged users across all the capabilities that Latch provides them in their spaces.
Beyond enabling a new set of experiences at buildings for residents and building operators, Latch turns the purchase experience of smart building technology for building owners from a complex sale with multiple vendors into a simple process with Latch as a single vendor with a single contract and straightforward billing. LatchOS enables a unified management experience for building operators with a single interface to manage all Latch experiences instead of having a separate interface for each vendor and solution. Latch also enables a unified resident experience with a single interface through the Latch App for all resident-facing interactions and Latch experiences in our customers’ buildings. Devices that are part of the Latch ecosystem work better together since our curated set of partner devices and our smart building operating system, LatchOS, seamlessly integrate instead of a patchwork of devices from different vendors with different standards and interfaces that create technology silos and limited experiences.
Our sales strategy is simple, repeatable, scalable and unique. We engage directly with our customers to ensure they have the best possible experience with Latch and our partners from sale to installation to lease-up. Latch engages with customers early in their construction or renovation process, establishing Latch as a technology advisor to the building. This engagement enables us to provide more technology advice early in the development process and creates high revenue visibility. Our customers sign letters of intent (“LOIs”), specifying which software and devices they want to receive and on which dates. This approach leads to multi-year software contracts, direct feedback loops with our customers and their residents, local and regional market insights and a complete picture of the ever-changing demands of building operators. Based on historical experience, we believe there is sufficient or reasonable certainty about the customers’ ability and intent to fulfill these commitments with a target delivery date no longer than 24 months following signing the LOI. We continuously evolve our products and add new features between signing the LOI and installation. For a description of our use of key business metrics related to LOIs, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Key Business Metrics.”
Currently, we primarily serve the rental home markets in North America. Based on internal research and external reporting, we estimate there are approximately 32 million multi-family apartment home units in North America. Today we primarily serve new construction and retrofit buildings. Since our launch in 2017, we have seen the share of our business coming from retrofit opportunities increase significantly: a trend we expect to continue over the medium term. We also serve the single-family rental market through our existing relationships with large real estate developers and owners. Based on internal research and external reporting, we estimate there are 15 million single-family rental home units in North America.
Developments in 2021
In February 2021, we launched the C2 series door-mounted access control product to make retrofits and ongoing operations easier for every project. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had bookings of over 280,000 units and delivered over 52,000 units to customers across the country. The C2 includes a patent-pending turn mechanism ensuring smooth locking and unlocking; a three-piece modular design simplifying and reducing installation costs; 24 months of expected battery life, decreasing building staff time and operational costs; and improved functionality and quality at a lower price to both customers and Latch.
In March 2021, we launched NFC unlock on Android through an over-the-air update, delivering a much desired feature for the industry and deepening our integrations with the Google ecosystem. As a result of owning the full technology stack—hardware, firmware and software—we can more easily and quickly deploy new features like NFC unlock that add immediate value to both building owners and residents. NFC unlock on Android has an average ~850ms unlock time and allows the user to unlock their door without even opening their phone, making for a more convenient and faster unlocking experience.
In May 2021, we announced the expansion of LatchOS into commercial offices, bringing Latch’s expertise in multifamily building management technology to the commercial office space for the first time. With the availability of LatchOS for offices, we are extending our smart access, visitor and delivery management, smart device and sensor control, connectivity and identity and personalization solutions to meet the needs of modern office spaces. The first solution in our new ecosystem for commercial offices is Latch Visitor Express, a new contactless visitor entry system designed to streamline visitor entry within office buildings, reduce lobby lines and wait times and greatly increase operational efficiencies for building staff. This innovative solution is powered by LatchID, our proprietary identification system that creates a trusted network of users across spaces and devices. LatchID provides users with digital credentials that can be accepted at Latch-enabled buildings, 
streamlining access across both residential, short-term rental and office spaces. Once users are credentialed, they receive a personalized and unified “identity” that works across every Latch-enabled space and device, allowing them to move seamlessly across Latch-enabled buildings.
On June 4, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 24, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company (formerly known as TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp. (“TSIA”)), Latch Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Latch, Inc. (“Legacy Latch”)) and Lionet Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of TSIA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Latch, with Legacy Latch becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Business Combination” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). 
In connection with the consummation of the Transactions (the “Closing”), the Company changed its name from TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp. to Latch, Inc. The “Post-Combination Company” following the Business Combination is Latch, Inc. On June 7, 2021, Latch’s common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbols “LTCH” and “LTCHW,” respectively. The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse capitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, TSIA is treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. We are deemed the accounting predecessor of the combined business and the successor SEC registrant, meaning that our financial statements for previous periods will be disclosed in future periodic reports filed with the SEC. See Note 1, Description of Business, in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements” for additional detail about the Business Combination.
In the third quarter of 2021, we announced the new Latch M, which is our latest mortise lock built for retrofits and new construction. The product is designed to be easy to install without any added infrastructure and brings all of the benefits of the new Latch Lens to the mortise format. The updated Latch M further broadens Latch’s ability to provide more buildings of all shapes and sizes with the experience of LatchOS, our full-building operating system of software, products and services. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, Latch announced new partnerships with Marks USA, a division of NAPCO Security Technologies (NASDAQ: NSSC), and TownSteel, Inc., along with an intended partnership with dormakaba Holding AG (SWX: DOKA). The powerful combination of these partnerships should bring LatchOS to even more residents, property managers and guests, and help accelerate Latch’s growth across new market segments, lock formats and verticals. The offerings with Marks, TownSteel and dormakaba are expected to be the first access-based partner offerings in Latch’s growing ecosystem of integrated first- and third-party devices, software and services.
COVID-19 Update
In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Measures taken by various governments to contain the virus have affected economic activity. We have taken a number of measures to monitor and mitigate the effects of COVID-19, such as safety and health measures for our people (such as social distancing and working from home) and securing the supply of materials that are essential to our production process. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and may continue to disrupt our hardware deliveries due to delays in construction timelines at our customers’ building sites. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity and a recession in the United States, and the economic situation remains fluid as parts of the economy appear to be recovering while others continue to struggle. COVID-19 has also affected our supply chain consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges. We expect these impacts, including potential delayed product availability and higher component and shipping costs, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges. We continue to invest in supply chain initiatives to address industry-wide capacity challenges. While the nature of the situation is dynamic, the Company has considered the impact when developing its estimates and assumptions. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.
In the first quarter of 2020, we initiated a restructuring plan as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and preserve liquidity due to the uncertainty and challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. We incurred costs in connection with a reduction in force (the “RIF”), which involved an approximate 25% reduction in headcount, including severance and benefits costs for affected employees and other miscellaneous direct costs. These amounts were recorded principally in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss based on the department to which the expense relates. As a result of our strong performance in 2020 and 2021, we rehired some of the staff that was terminated at the outset of the pandemic.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to provide certain relief in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures. Among the various provisions in the CARES Act, the Company is utilizing the payroll tax deferrals. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company received and repaid $3.4 million in loans under the CARES Act.
Market Opportunity
Real estate is the world’s largest asset class. The broad ecosystem of institutionally owned and managed buildings represents a significant opportunity for us. We see opportunities to improve and augment our existing product suite to fit the needs of customers and stakeholders across the real estate ecosystem. We envision a world where every space in each stakeholder’s path is unified under the Latch system, from the home, to the office and more. 
Today, we primarily serve the multifamily markets with our existing set of LatchOS software modules. Multifamily real estate ownership is highly fragmented, with the top 50 multifamily owners only holding 10.7% of total home units in North America. We view our addressable market in three broad categories: 
New Multifamily Construction 
According to U.S. census data, over the five-year period from January 2016 through December 2020, an average of approximately 340,000 new multifamily home units, representing new construction completions for buildings with five home units or more, were built each year. 
Multifamily Retrofits 
According to U.S. census data, over the period from 2010 to 2020, occupied apartment stock grew from approximately 18 million home units to approximately 24 million home units. 
Institutionally Owned Single-Family Rental 
Our set of solutions is also highly complementary to the single-family rental market given that our software products provide portfolio-wide management of all of our devices installed in a customer’s home units. Large single-family rental portfolios are particularly well-suited for this type of solution as a result of lower asset density as compared to multifamily. We see a significant opportunity to become a partner for single-family rental owners to achieve efficiencies in managing large portfolios of rental assets. 
Products and Platform
Our platform, LatchOS, is a full building operating system that brings together all the elements that make up the modern building experience for building managers, vendors and residents. The LatchOS ecosystem consists of two general elements: software and devices. Our software and devices enable the essential features for every stakeholder in the Latch ecosystem.
Latch has three software products in the market today: the Latch Resident Mobile Applications, Latch Manager Web and the Latch Manager Mobile Applications. These three products encompass the software that powers the LatchOS platform and allows devices and services to operate in harmony. We also have a collection of first-party devices and third-party partner devices and services that can integrate into the LatchOS system to be managed, controlled and/or operated through our software products.
Software Products
Latch Mobile Applications
The Latch mobile applications are the primary tools for residents to unlock doors, give access to guests or service providers, control and manage smart devices, interact and communicate with the building or consumer services and transact with Latch. Latch offers a subset of these experiences through the Apple Watch as well.
Latch Manager Web and Manager Mobile Applications
Latch Manager Web is LatchOS’s central orchestration application for building operators. Our fully integrated system lets property managers support the resident experience from a single source. From the Latch Manager Web, property managers can control access sharing, resolve issues remotely, save time and money on rental unit turnover and ensure their residents are secure.
First Party Hardware Devices
M, C, R Series
The M, C and R series are door-mounted access control products that interface with industry-standard lock hardware. They are designed to meet every project requirement. They are built to industry standards, compliant with code requirements and suited for interior or exterior use.
Other Devices
Latch Intercom integrates seamlessly into the Latch core access systems and allows audio and video calls for remote unlocking. Latch Camera is a dome camera that integrates seamlessly into Latch Intercom and core access systems to allow for video calls for remote unlocking. Latch Hub is an all-in-one connectivity solution that enables smart access, smart home and sensor devices to do more at every building. The Latch Leak Detector offers a simple and scalable solution to enable leak prevention, detection and quick resolution for building owners and residents.
Works with Latch: Third Party Devices, Software and Partnerships
The LatchOS platform is compatible with a collection of industry-leading smart home devices, allowing these devices to be managed, controlled and viewed from the LatchOS platform. Latch has selected several initial smart home devices with which to integrate (currently or in the near term), including smart home devices manufactured by Google Nest, Honeywell, ecobee and Jasco, based on Latch’s assessment that these devices are aligned with Latch’s vision around enterprise device management privacy and security, design and brand when it comes to building operators and residents. Latch has entered into agreements with Google Nest, Honeywell and ecobee. Such agreements include application programming interface (API) licensing terms that allow partner devices to be managed, controlled and viewed from the LatchOS platform as appropriate for desired functionality. Such agreements include other terms that are customary in API license agreements, including intellectual property ownership and licensing provisions, joint marketing and advertising arrangements, indemnification obligations, confidentiality restrictions and data protection requirements. Jasco smart lighting products can be controlled by the LatchOS platform through the Zigbee protocol; therefore, no separate API license agreement is necessary between Latch and Jasco in order to integrate the LatchOS platform with their smart lighting products.
We understand that operating a building can be complex, and it can take many different processes, systems and tools to manage a great building. A majority of buildings we work with use property management software to manage their back-office operations. In order to accommodate those complex use-cases, we have forged partnerships with the top property management software companies, such as Yardi, RealPage and Entrata, and enabled integrations between such software and our software and devices so the building can operate seamlessly between the two systems at the building.
We leverage our cutting-edge smart access platform to unlock new use-cases in adjacent real estate verticals and with partners that serve buildings. Our smart access platform integrates with partners such as Tour24, Pynwheel and UPS to enable unattended showings and secure package delivery, and it has also allowed us to build a robust business to business to consumer distribution channel for us to transact with residents through the Latch App and offer future consumer and on-demand services.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Strong and Sticky Software Distribution Model 
We believe we offer the premier platform for distributing enterprise software into the portfolios of multifamily owners and developers. Each of our hardware products has an associated long-term software contract. Through our software, our customers receive enterprise management of all Latch supported hardware products and residents receive unified control of devices, home unit access and amenity access all from within the Latch App. 
Compelling Recurring Revenue Model 
Each Latch customer must sign a software contract with Latch in order to utilize our suite of products and services through LatchOS. Our average contract length is between five and six years. Most of our customers prepay their software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) contract subscription fees, which gives us long-term predictability of our SaaS revenue. 
Trusted Technology Partner for Rental Home Operators 
We take what normally are disparate solutions and devices and combine them into a powerful system in which we believe all components work better together. The power of LatchOS is combining software and devices into a unified system that works for apartment building owners. This vertical-specific software approach gives our customers a single vendor, single contract and single interface to manage more of the essential needs in their buildings. 
Passionate, Founder-Led Team
Our co-founders and management team have broad and deep experience at some of the world’s leading technology companies, and approximately 40% of our team have backgrounds in engineering, product and design.
Visible, Long-term Sales
Our customers sign LOIs outlining the software and devices they intend to buy for their building up to 24 months in advance of installation. This visibility supports our demand planning, forecasting and mapping of customer demands for certain products and services.
Efficient Customer Acquisition
Our targeted account-based sales model allows us to sell rapidly and deeply into the portfolios of North America’s largest rental home developers and owners. In addition, we have been able to acquire valuable customers with relatively low sales and marketing expenses due to strong product-market fit and an efficient sales strategy, resulting in a 6.6x lifetime customer value to customer acquisition cost ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021. We define lifetime customer value as total expected revenue collected per home unit reduced by the related cost of revenue over the home unit life. We define customer acquisition cost as total sales and marketing expense per new home unit acquisition. We use the lifetime customer value to customer acquisition cost ratio to measure customer acquisition efficiency. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate this ratio or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
Our platform gives us the opportunity to sell our customers’ residents additional products and services in the future, including laundry pick-up, in-home cleaning, handyman services and more. We plan to generate revenue from such services by offering the services through the Latch mobile applications and charging fees to the residents and/or service providers performing the services. We plan to partner with local service providers to perform these services and may directly perform these services in the future. 
Our Mobile Applications 
Our mobile applications give us the opportunity to sell additional products and services directly to residents in our customers’ buildings. By acquiring the building as a customer and the building owners onboarding their residents as part of their business operations, we do not incur any additional costs to acquire the residents of the building as customers. 
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio 
Our robust intellectual property portfolio, which includes patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, enables us to protect our proprietary technology, brands and other intellectual property against dilution, infringement, misappropriation and competitive pressure. Specifically, we own several patents and pending patent applications in the United States that cover the material aspects of the LatchOS platform, including Smart Access, Delivery & Guest Management, Smart Home & Sensors and Resident Experience. None of these patents are expected to expire prior to 2035. We also own patents and pending patent applications in the United States covering the ornamental design of our hardware products. None of such patents are expected to expire prior to 2025. We also own foreign counterparts related to the foregoing patents and pending patent applications. Additionally, our proprietary software and firmware are protected as trade secrets. 
Our Growth Strategy
Our main objective is to increase the number of customers on the LatchOS platform and increase utilization of our platform by each customer and user, both operations staff and residents. To achieve this objective, we pursue the following strategies: 
Further Penetration of North American Multifamily and Single-Family Rental Markets 
We plan to further organically expand in these markets via two primary strategies. First, we aim to continue to acquire new customers through our direct sales strategy. Second, we plan to build onto our existing customer relationships and sell deeper into our customer’s portfolios through existing portfolio retrofits, new construction and upsells of additional LatchOS modules to existing buildings. 
Geographic Expansion 
Today, we only have commercial operations in the United States and Canada. While these geographies present sizable opportunities for Latch, our solution set is well-positioned to enter new geographic markets such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France. We see an opportunity to expand to the European market in the future, leveraging anchor partners like Tishman Speyer.
New Products and Services 
Our existing suite of hardware and software is just the beginning of our product expansion. Our dedicated team of designers, engineers and product managers are creating new and innovative products and features for the Latch ecosystem. Once a customer is using LatchOS, new software modules can be seamlessly activated over the air via our management interface. We build our products with the goal of making the experience for all stakeholders seamless and intuitive and hold ourselves to the highest standards of excellence and innovation in our product development. We are also in active dialogue with other industry participants on how we can expand our offerings with new products through partnerships with other companies. 
Capturing Digital Consumer Services Spending 
A tremendous amount of spending occurs inside the home, including a wide range of on-demand services, dry cleaning, home cleaning, maintenance, individual internet connectivity, renter’s insurance and even rent payment-related services. The power of LatchOS is that we believe we can bring all of these services to the resident in a single interface through the Latch App. We have several new products and resident services in development that we will continue to release to Latch residents to better serve these stakeholders and make their spaces better places to live. 
New Real Estate End-Markets 
The rental home market is just our first step. We envision a world where the spaces in each person’s path are unified under the Latch system, from the home, to the office and everything in between. The opportunity to provide a Latch-enabled solution to new markets such as commercial office, hospitality and more are attractive opportunities toward achieving this long-term vision. 
Seasonality
The construction and retrofit market is seasonal, with greater activity in the spring and summer and typically weaker demand in the winter. We expect our financial results and working capital requirements to reflect seasonal variations over time, although our growth and market expansion have obscured the impact of seasonality in our historical financials and may continue to do so. 
Competition
Given the emerging nature of the smart building industry, there are a number of companies developing solutions that may be similar to the LatchOS ecosystem, or parts thereof. The smart building industry is highly fragmented with many players, ranging from companies focused on singular smart building experiences (i.e., smart home solutions, package room solutions, intercoms, etc.), to middleware companies that do not develop most of their own hardware and stitch together third party solutions, leading to partial or incomplete smart building experiences. We believe the majority of these other companies are developing solutions that do not solve buildings’ needs comprehensively or meet the enterprise management and security requirements of large enterprise environments. We believe that our innovative product design, enterprise-grade platform, focus on privacy and security, commercial traction, issued and pending patents, broad intellectual property portfolio and 
strong engineering and operations team provide us with a competitive advantage over these other smart building companies. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for full building operating systems matures. Our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:
•our platforms’ and solutions’ functionality, performance, ease of use, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors’ products;
•our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace;
•our success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies;
•our ability to attract and retain partners;
•our name recognition and reputation;
•our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and
•our ability to protect our intellectual property.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to multiple contract manufacturers in Asia and the United States. The majority of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products are sourced from third-party suppliers and are generally purchased on our behalf by our manufacturers, subject to certain supplier lists approved by us. Our supply chain team coordinates the relationships between our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. 
We purchase from our contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance programs and manufacturing standards. We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required to manufacture our products to have control of supply pipelines. To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, based on our estimates of future demand for particular products and services.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other general economic factors, we experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, component shortages, and the predictability of the future availability of these components is limited. Such component shortages resulted in higher component costs, particularly where we paid spot market prices for such components. We expect to continue to incur these higher costs where economically reasonable in order to prioritize and meet customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic and other general economic factors have also affected the supply chain for many of our product components, creating shipping and logistical challenges, delays and elevated shipping costs for us. We expect these impacts, including potential delayed product availability and higher component and shipping costs, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges.
Government Regulation
We conduct our business in the United States and Canada and source our products from Asia and the United States. We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, agencies and regulatory bodies or authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing product safety and consumer protection laws, data privacy and security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations, antitrust laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.
Anti-Corruption and Export Laws
We are subject to the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act and possibly other anti-bribery laws, including those that comply with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and other international conventions. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private-sector. Certain laws could also prohibit us from soliciting or accepting bribes or kickbacks. We can be held liable for the corrupt activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies.
Our operations require us to import from Asia and export to Canada, which geographically stretches our compliance obligations. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act and may be subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions. Our products are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We may also be subject to import/export laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business or source our products. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.
United States 
We and our channel partners are subject to various federal, state and local regulations related to access control products, such as state and local building and fire codes, the American Disabilities Act, and requirements for UL and FCC certifications. We and our partners may be subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, data privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. Privacy and security laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, standards and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts and can result in investigations, proceedings or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was voted into law in November 2020 by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt-outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. Additionally, in 2021, Virginia and Colorado passed general data protection laws. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the “VCDPA”) will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act (the “CPA”) will go into effect on July 1, 2023. Both laws will provide residents in their respective states similar rights to those granted Californians under the CPRA, including the right to access, correct and delete their personal information, as well as the rights to opt out of the sale and processing of personal information for certain purposes. Currently, privacy bills are moving through the legislative process in 18 other states. We expect that some of these bills will be passed as laws, thereby further increasing our state privacy obligations. 
In addition to state privacy bills, there is also increasing local activity. For instance, in May 2021, New York City passed into law the Tenant Data Privacy Act (the “TDPA”), regulating how building access data is collected, processed and disposed of by property managers and smart access system operators. The TDPA went into effect in July 2021, and we had to make certain adjustments to our processing of data collected from New York City users of LatchOS as a result. Similar local legislation in other cities where we operate is likely, which will further increase the complexity and expense of ensuring that our privacy practices are compliant.
Additionally, the interpretations of existing federal and state consumer protection laws relating to online collection, use, dissemination and security of personal information adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), state attorneys general, private plaintiffs and courts have evolved, and may continue to evolve, over time. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. 
Canada 
In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and similar provincial laws impose obligations with respect to processing personal information. PIPEDA requires companies to obtain an individual’s consent when collecting, using or disclosing that individual’s personal information. Individuals have the right to access and challenge the accuracy of their personal information held by an organization, and personal information may only be used for the purposes for which it was collected. If an organization intends to use personal information for another purpose, it must again obtain that individual’s consent. Failure to comply with PIPEDA could result in significant fines and penalties. 
Europe
In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Relatedly, from January 1, 2021, companies doing business in the European Union and the United Kingdom have to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision that United Kingdom data protection standards are adequate under the meaning of GDPR’s Article 45, providing a mechanism to enable transfer of data from the European Union to the United Kingdom without the need for additional authorization or safeguards. This decision will be in force for four years, when it will be re-reviewed, but also can be withdrawn before the expiration of the four-year period if the United Kingdom were to lower its standards and no longer provide European Union citizens adequate protection for their personal data. These changes and uncertainties may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 420 full-time employees in the United States and approximately 20 international employees primarily based in our Taipei office. We also engage consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in engineering, software and product development, sales and related functions. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our domestic or international employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. 
Employee Recruiting, Retention and Professional Development
We recognize the importance of inclusion and diversity and strive to foster an environment where these principles are woven into everything we do. We are committed to fostering diversity, equity and inclusion through our programs, products and people. In 2021, we hired a Vice President of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Cultural Engagement dedicated to driving inclusivity and diversity across the organization.
Our employees are our most important asset. We offer a comprehensive compensation package with base pay, discretionary bonus and equity incentive opportunities, paid time off and a family-friendly benefits package to ensure our team members have the flexibility and support for a healthy work/life balance. In an effort to protect our employees and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our workforce has been operating remotely since March 9, 2020.
Our focus on continued professional growth includes a company-wide dedicated learning and development program with a focus on leadership development and talent planning assessments, as well as semi-annual reviews that result in individualized growth plans created by each team member and collaboratively updated with their manager.
