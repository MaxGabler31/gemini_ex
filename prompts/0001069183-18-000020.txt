Item 1. Business
Company Background and Business Strategy
Axon Enterprise, Inc.’s (the “Company” or “Axon” or “we” or “our”) core mission is to protect life through innovative technologies that make communities safer. We are the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of CEWs designed for use by law enforcement, corrections, military forces, private security personnel and by private individuals for personal defense. We are also the market leader in developing, manufacturing and selling connected wearable on-officer cameras as well as developing and selling cloud-based digital evidence management software. We have established a robust network that connects devices, apps and people primarily in the law enforcement vertical market. We aim to have every public safety officer in the world carry a TASER, deploy an Axon camera and be connected to the Axon network.
The three foundations for our growth strategy are:

• | Devices - Our TASER CEWs are one of the few weapons that can incapacitate a person while drastically limiting the risk for death and/or serious injury. Over the past two decades, the TASER CEW has become one of the most frequently used weapons in the North American law enforcement market, with use-of-force injuries and deaths dropping dramatically as a result. Outside of weapons, we produce devices that primarily fall within three categories: on-officer cameras that capture critical digital evidence aimed at protecting truth, a range of related accessory hardware devices and an in-car camera variant called Axon Fleet. We refer to these cameras, related accessories and devices collectively as "Axon" products. We believe our CEWs and Axon cameras should be standard-issue equipment for all patrol officers domestically and internationally. We have created and are continuing to create service plans and product bundles to allow agencies to have the latest devices and technology at predictable annual costs.


• | Apps - Axon's Evidence.com platform is designed to help agencies securely store, manage and share all digital evidence. Our software platform features continuous improvement with regular software updates that enable our customers to always have access to the latest technology. Recent new features include secure sharing, audit trails, integration of other data sources, and transcription and redaction services. These feature sets are designed to provide our customers with valuable tools to police more efficiently and effectively while enabling greater transparency with the communities they serve. An increasing number police agencies trust Axon to host their video evidence data, which is captured via our devices, apps and software, and stored in our secure cloud and accessed via the Axon network.


• | People - Our TASER weapons and Axon software and sensors platforms have allowed us to build relationships with more than 20,000 public safety agencies worldwide. Axon's goal is to bring modern information technology capabilities to every law enforcement officer. Some of our customers report that police officers are spending over 60% of their time on paperwork-related tasks, rather than on value-added public safety work. We see a large opportunity to leverage our connected platform to enable a broad suite of mobile, wearable, and data management capabilities. Axon is also improving workflows throughout the public safety chain, from the incident on the scene to the court room. With our software, police officers can share evidence with prosecutors during discovery while maintaining a secure and encrypted chain of custody. Axon's cohesive ecosystem is delivering increased value to all public safety stakeholders, including state and municipal police agencies, police chiefs and other leadership, patrol officers, state patrols and officers, agency detectives, public prosecutors, district attorneys, and others in the public safety and judicial communities, as well as the public communities they serve.

5

We have four strategic growth areas:

• | Expand TASER CEW adoption: We believe we can increase the ratio of TASER CEWs to patrol officers domestically as well as continue expand into new international markets. We believe that our strategy of offering payment plans and eventually subscription hardware plans will shorten upgrade cycles and expand our immediately addressable market. Also, through continuing research and development ("R&D"), we believe that our TASER CEWs will become more capable and more connected over time, thus increasing in value and utility for our customers.


• | Expand Axon body camera and Evidence.com market share and increase average revenue per user ("ARPU"): Axon is the market leader in body-worn cameras and digital evidence management. Of the top 50 metropolitan areas in the U.S., 38 are on the Axon network. We believe we are well-positioned to build upon our prior success, and that our software offerings can become more valuable to our customers as we continue to expand our service offerings to better help agencies store, manage and share evidence data.


• | Capture in-car video market share with Axon Fleet: In the second quarter of 2017, we began shipping our in-car video offering, Axon Fleet. This is a new and adjacent market for Axon that we believe we can continue to grow through offering a superior product and service with disruptive pricing.


• | Expand into police agency records management systems and computer-aided dispatch software: In late 2016, we announced our intention to develop a police agency enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system, Axon Records, that would put officers back on the streets, help to solve and prosecute crime, and help to prevent crime and other incidents. Our development of Axon Records supports our strategic focus and vision of growing recurring cash flows by leveraging the data we host to unlock value-added services to our customers.

Technological innovation is key to all four long-term growth areas. By investing in R&D, we intend to continue to develop novel, high-value solutions across our product platforms and expand our total addressable market within the law enforcement and public safety vertical markets. In 2017, we invested heavily in a new artificial intelligence (“AI”) group, Axon AI. Through two acquisitions plus additional hires, we have developed a team that is delivering AI features in our products as well as winning industry recognition. In 2017, we were named the preferred AI vendor for the Los Angeles Police Department. In early 2018, we opened an R&D office in Tampere, Finland, with 10 imaging and sensor experts who will work with our existing teams to create best-in-class smart cameras that integrate with our cloud platform. We also continue to add engineering talent to our Scottsdale headquarters and Seattle engineering and development office.
Company Organization
Axon sells its products to law enforcement worldwide through its direct sales force, distribution partners, online store and third-party resellers. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis, with various sales representatives strategically located throughout the world. Domestic and international law enforcement agencies are primarily served through the Company's headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, and its software engineering development center located in Seattle, Washington. The Company also has subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Vietnam and Canada.
The Company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments: the sale of CEWs, accessories and other related products and services (the “TASER Weapons” segment); and the software and sensors business, focused on Axon devices, wearables, applications, cloud and mobile products (the "Software and Sensors" segment). Within the Software and Sensors segment, the Company includes only revenues and costs attributable to that segment which include: costs of sales for both products and services, direct labor, selling expense for the sales team, product management and marketing expenses, trade shows and related expenses, finance and accounting expenses, and research and development for products included, or to be included, within the Software and Sensors segment. All other costs are included in the TASER Weapons segment. Further information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region is included in Notes 1 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have made certain acquisitions of companies or their assets in the past two years that are described in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
Products
TASER Weapons Products
We make CEWs for two main types of market segments: (i) the law enforcement, military, corrections and private security markets; and (ii) the consumer market. Our CEWs use our proprietary Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (“NMI”) technology to effectively neutralize suspects or threats. From a replaceable cartridge containing compressed nitrogen, two small probes that are attached to the CEW by insulated conductive wires are deployed from up to 35 feet away. Electrical pulses are transmitted along the wires and into the body, affecting the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system.
6

Since 2009, our CEWs have been on our Smart Weapons system, an all-digital platform that features the ability to regulate charge output, perform health checks, update firmware over the Internet, and provide analytics on device usage. Through the Company's Evidence.com platform, important records such as the event logs, which record user actions such as safety activation and trigger event durations, can be viewed and analyzed.
The benefits of using CEWs in the field have been significant. Studies have shown that TASER CEWs have prevented death or serious injury more than 178,000 times from the first deployment in 2000 to the end of 2017. The use of these devices instead of other force options has significantly reduced injuries for suspects and officers, with substantial liability and workers’ compensation savings to government agencies around the world.
The following products are core to the Company's TASER Weapons product line:
TASER X26P - The X26P is a single-shot, compact Smart Weapon designed for law enforcement and military use. It features the smallest form factor of our law enforcement models and was ergonomically designed with ease of use in mind.
TASER X2 - The X2 is a double-shot Smart Weapon designed for law enforcement and military use. In addition to the back-up shot, the X2 also features dual lasers and the warning arc, a visible electric charge that increases voluntary surrenders and de-escalates conflicts without cartridge deployment.
Consumer CEWs - The Company has two consumer CEW models, the Bolt (formerly known as the C2) and the Pulse. The two products differ in form factor but both feature the same NMI effects as the CEW models available to law enforcement and run in cycles of 30 seconds, which is intended to allow adequate time for the user to escape a threat.
Replacement Cartridges and Consumables - The Company manufactures multiple cartridge types with effective ranges from 15' to 35'. Smart cartridges communicate with the firing control system within the TASER X2 to indicate the type of cartridge loaded in each bay and its deployment status. Standard replacement cartridges are used in the TASER X26P as well as our consumer models. The Company also offers Performance Power Magazines (“PPM”), batteries that power the CEWs. PPMs are available in several options, such as Tactical (“TPPM”) or Automatic Shut-Down (“APPM”).
Axon Connected Solutions
Axon creates connected technologies to protect truth in public safety. As a company that grew from our TASER business, we are building on a history of innovation in policing. Axon is more than a collection of individual technologies; it is a cohesive ecosystem. Every product from our Smart Weapons to our body-worn cameras to our digital evidence management system integrates seamlessly with one another, and often complements the systems and processes a customer already uses. Below are the products and features that are core to the Axon platform.
Axon Hardware Products:
Axon Body 2 - Axon Body 2 builds upon the original platform by bringing officers new features such as high-definition ("HD") video, wireless fidelity ("Wi-Fi") offload capabilities, extended battery life, and additional security enhancements. The Axon Body 2 can be mounted on the officer's shirt at mid-chest level and eliminates all wires from the wearer’s body.
Axon Flex 2 - The Axon Flex 2 builds upon the original Axon Flex camera system and features a more rugged industrial design, new mounts and advanced capabilities like unlimited HD video, a 120-degree field of view, extended battery life, improved buffering and wireless activation.
Axon Fleet - Axon Fleet is a breakthrough in-car video system with advanced capabilities and a price that is significantly less than traditional systems. Axon Fleet includes automatic activation, HD video and a flexible design.
Axon Dock - With the Axon Dock, the camera charging station is also the automatic data downloader. At the end of a shift, the Axon Dock syncs video from the user's Axon Flex or Axon Body camera during routine charging. Videos are uploaded directly to Evidence.com, eliminating manual filing processes.
TASER CAM HD - The TASER CAM HD is a recording device built into a PPM battery pack for use with compatible TASER CEWs. The device can capture critical video and audio before, during and after a TASER CEW deployment.
7

Axon Signal - Axon Signal is a technology that enables Axon Body 2, Axon Flex 2 and Axon Fleet cameras to start recording upon certain triggering events such as the opening of a patrol car door, activation of a patrol car lightbar or the unholstering of a TASER CEW.
Signal Sidearm - Signal Sidearm is a device that is compatible with most firearm holsters. The moment an officer removes a firearm from a holster, Signal Sidearm wirelessly alerts all nearby Axon cameras to begin recording. 
Axon Software and Mobile Technologies:
Evidence.com - As the sources of digital evidence expand, storage alone is not enough to keep track of the body-worn camera videos, photos, audio recordings and other data that is overwhelming agency servers and systems. Evidence.com is a robust end-to-end solution that not only allows agencies to store all that data, but also enables new workflows for managing and sharing that data. Officers and command staff can upload content from Axon and TASER devices or other systems easily, manage it with search and retrieval features, and collaborate with prosecutors by using powerful sharing features. When storage needs or users increase, the cloud-based system allows agencies to scale instantly and cost-effectively.
Evidence Sync - Evidence Sync is a desktop-based application that enables evidence in any format, from any source to be uploaded to Evidence.com. TASER Smart Weapon logs, Axon camera videos, interview room footage, photos and more can be uploaded, stored, and managed in one location. Sources new and old—from TASER devices or other brands—are equally supported. Network servers, secure digital memory cards ("SD cards"), compact discs ("CDs"), and computer folders can be synced with ease, and frequently used folders or drives can be set up to automatically sync on schedule.
Commander - Axon Commander is an on-premise application that consolidates all of a customer's digital evidence in one secure location, making it easy to manage and access while maintaining security and chain of custody. Designed to meet the evidence management needs of agencies in regions without reliable high-speed Internet access, Commander delivers many of the same features of cloud-based Evidence.com to customers using on-premise storage systems.
Axon Citizen - Axon Citizen is a mobile application that provides a public safety portal where community members can submit photos and videos of an incident they witness directly to their agency on Evidence.com.
Axon Capture - Axon Capture is a mobile application that allows officers to capture digital evidence right from the field. The app eliminates the need to carry three separate devices for photo, video, and audio recording by securely building upon the capabilities of an officer's mobile phone. Officers can add tags, titles or Global Positioning System ("GPS") coordinates to any recordings before uploading the data to Evidence.com.
Axon View - Axon View is a mobile application that wirelessly connects with an Axon camera to provide instant playback of unfolding events from the field, in the field. The app's live display ensures the camera is positioned correctly.
Axon Interview - Axon Interview is a recording system designed for the interview room. The system records crucial interviews with redundant, high-quality video and audio technology, ensuring that every moment is captured. The system is available with a 24/7 buffering option that allows agencies to capture key dialogue even after it occurs.
Markets and Distribution
Law Enforcement 
Our primary target market for both our weapon and video products is federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and throughout the world. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately two-thirds of all law enforcement patrol officers carry a TASER CEW and internationally, approximately one out of every fifty eligible law enforcement officers carries a TASER CEW. Our goal is to have our CEWs be standard issue equipment for all domestic and international law agencies.
Other Markets
We also target military forces, private security, correctional facilities and consumer personal protection markets to provide technologies that offer a less lethal form of protection.

U.S. Distribution
The Company sells directly to law enforcement agencies in the U.S. as well as through a distribution network. Distributors are selected based upon their reputation within their respective industries, contacts and distribution network. Our regional sales managers work closely with the distributors in their territory to inform and educate the law enforcement communities. We continue to monitor our law enforcement distributors closely to help ensure that our service standards are achieved. Where appropriate, we intend to grow our direct sales over time. Distributors often allow us to penetrate regions at lower fixed costs; however, direct sales allow us greater control over the customer relationship.
Sales in the private citizen market are primarily made through our distributors and our website. We have implemented a variety of marketing initiatives to support sales of our consumer products, with a focus on web, public relations and consumer trade shows. We have consulted with professional digital media and public relations professionals to assist us in media and press events and editorial placements along with attending numerous trade shows specifically to target the consumer market.
International Distribution
We market and distribute our CEW products to foreign markets through our international subsidiaries as well as through a network of distributors. For geographical and cultural reasons, our distributors usually have a territory defined by their country’s borders. These distributors market both our law enforcement, military, and corrections products, and our consumer products where allowed by law. Our distributors work with local law enforcement, military and corrections agencies in the same manner as our domestic market distributors. For example, they may perform demonstrations, attend industry trade shows, maintain country specific websites, engage in print advertising and arrange training classes.
In order to more effectively engage customers internationally, we have also implemented direct sales teams strategically located throughout each major geographic region of the world. Having dedicated sales personnel stationed full time in these regions will allow us to better serve existing customers as well as execute our sales and marketing strategies more efficiently in order to continue to grow our customer base in new markets.
Manufacturing
We perform light manufacturing, final assembly, and final test operations at our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. This includes critical injection molds, schematics, automation equipment, test equipment and prototypes utilized by our supply chain for the conversion of raw materials into sub-assemblies. We have implemented lean/six sigma methodologies to optimize most direct and indirect resources within the organization, which has helped boost capacity for existing products, as well as provide flexibility to accommodate production of new TASER and Axon product introductions. We are currently operating one to two production shifts depending on inventory levels and demand. However, other capacity options, including the use of additional shifts, will be considered should we experience higher demand resulting from large orders of legacy or new product releases. We have continued to maintain our ISO 9001 certification and have recently attained the new ISO 9001:2015 certification.
The Company currently purchases both off-the-shelf and custom components, including finished circuit boards assemblies and injection-molded plastic components, primarily from suppliers located in the U.S., Mexico, China and Taiwan. Although the Company currently obtains many of these components from single sources of supply, the Company owns the designs as well as the injection molded component tooling and test fixtures used in production for all custom components. As a result, management believes it could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. The Company also strategically holds safety stock levels on custom components to further reduce this risk. For off-the-shelf components, Management believes that there are readily available alternative suppliers in most cases who can consistently meet the Company's needs for these components. The Company acquires most of its components on a purchase order basis and does not have any significant long-term contracts with suppliers.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its second and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due primarily to municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future net sales or financial performance.

Backlog
Our backlog for products and services includes all orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our backlog was $582.7 million and $384.2 million, respectively. 
In the TASER Weapons segment, we define backlog as equal to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed and collected from the customer for goods and services to be delivered in subsequent periods. The Company processes orders within the TASER Weapons segment quickly, and our best estimate of firm orders outstanding as of period end represents those that have been paid for but remain undelivered. The TASER weapons backlog balance was $46.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects to realize $16.7 million of this deferred revenue balance as revenue during the next 12 months. This represents cash received from customers on or prior to December 31, 2017 for products and services expected to be delivered in the next 12 months.
In the Software and Sensors segment, we define backlog as cumulative bookings, net of cancellations, less product and service revenue recognized to date. Bookings are generally realized as revenue over multiple years. The Software and Sensors backlog balance was $536.0 million as of December 31, 2017. This backlog balance includes $78.6 million of deferred revenue, $27.0 million that has been invoiced, but not yet collected, and $430.4 million that has been recorded as bookings but not yet invoiced, all as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects to realize approximately $110.0 million of the December 31, 2017 backlog balance as revenue during the next 12 months.

Competition
Law Enforcement, Corrections and Private Security Markets
Law enforcement customers partner with TASER for the long-term. The primary competitive factors in the law enforcement and corrections market include a weapon’s accuracy, effectiveness, safety, cost, ease of use and an exceptional customer experience. We are aware of competitors providing competing CEW products, primarily in international markets.
We also believe our CEWs compete indirectly with a variety of other less-lethal alternatives. These alternatives include, but are not limited to, pepper spray, batons and impact weapons sold by companies such as Defense Technology. We believe our TASER brand devices’ advanced technology, versatility, portability, effectiveness, built-in accountability systems, and low injury rate enable us to compete effectively against these other less-lethal alternatives.
Private Citizen Market
CEWs have gained limited acceptance in the private citizen market. These devices primarily compete with guns, but also with other less lethal weapons such as pepper spray. The primary competitive factors in the private citizen market include a weapon’s cost, effectiveness, safety and ease of use.
Video Evidence Market
Axon is the market leader in a video evidence capture and management market that is highly fragmented and competitive. Continued evolution in the industry and technology shifts are creating opportunities for both established and new competitors. Key competitive factors include: product performance, product features, product quality and warranty, total cost of ownership, data security, data and information work flows, company reputation and financial strength, and relationships with customers. 
Our digital evidence management system, Evidence.com, is a cloud-based platform. Cloud computing fundamentally changes the way local, state and federal government agencies will develop and deploy software applications. Applications used by these agencies have historically required the agency to deploy their own infrastructure of servers, storage, network devices and operating systems. With a cloud-based system, the entire storage infrastructure is managed by third-parties who specialize in infrastructure management. Agencies use Internet web browsers to access the application. Our cloud-based Evidence.com service enables 
10

agencies to store, manage and analyze digital evidence. We believe our end-to-end solution providing a combination of both products and services is a compelling value proposition for law enforcement agencies to implement.
Regulatory Matters
U.S. Regulation
The majority of TASER CEWs, as well as the cartridges used by these devices, are subject to regulations; however, most are not considered to be “firearms” by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Many states have regulations restricting the sale and use of stun guns, hand-held shock devices and electronic weapons. We believe existing stun gun laws and regulations apply to TASER CEWs.
In many cases, the law enforcement and corrections market is subject to different regulations than the private citizen market. Where different regulations exist, we assume the regulations affecting the private citizen market also apply to the private security markets, except as the applicable regulations otherwise specifically provide.
As of December 31, 2017, the possession of stun guns by the general public, including TASER CEWs, is prohibited in four states: Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island, as well as in the District of Columbia. In 2017, New Jersey ended its state ban on stun guns for civilians. Some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our CEW products.
We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations, including restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products. Reference is made to Section 1A, Risk Factors under the heading “Environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.”
Axon body worn cameras and fleet vehicle cameras are subject to regulations including 21-CFR-47 Part 15, Subpart C for Bluetooth and WiFi transmission, US-DOT/UN 38.3 for transportation of lithium batteries, and FCC KDB 447498 + IEEE 1528-2013 Specific Absorption Rate ("SAR") regulations. These regulations are also beginning to affect CEWs with signal performance power magazine ("SPPM") technology and future CEWs implementing wireless technology into the feature set.
Evidence.com is subject to government regulation of the Internet in many areas, including telecommunications, data protection, user privacy and online content.
U.S. Export Regulation
CEWs are considered a crime control product (ECCN: 0A985) by the U.S. government. Accordingly, the export of our devices is regulated under export administration regulations. As a result, we must obtain export licenses from the Department of Commerce for all shipments to foreign countries other than Canada. Most of our requests for export licenses have been granted, and the need to obtain these licenses has not caused a material delay in our shipments. Export regulations also prohibit the further shipment of our products from foreign markets in which we hold a valid export license to foreign markets in which we do not hold an export license for our products.
Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") established by the U.S. Department of Commerce restrict the export of technology used in our CEWs. These regulations apply to both the technology incorporated in our CEW systems and to the processes used to produce them. These restrictions apply to any individual that is not a U.S. Citizen, U.S. Permanent Resident, or “protected person” as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3).
Foreign Regulation
Foreign regulations, which may affect our devices, and sale thereof, are numerous and often unclear. We prefer to work with a distributor who is familiar with the applicable import regulations in each of our foreign markets. Experience with foreign distributors in the past indicates that restrictions may prohibit certain sales of our products in a number of countries. However, the majority of countries permit TASER devices to be sold and used by law enforcement. We maintain strong communication channels with our distributors to ensure that we are aware of ongoing regulation of our products and of those countries where TASER CEW devices are prohibited or restricted.
Contracts 
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including those related to the award, administration and performance of contracts. Governmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for 
11

reasons including, but not limited to, non-appropriation of funds. We monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We provide limited manufacturer's warranties on our CEWs and Axon devices.  Further information about our warranties is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property with U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2017, we hold 137 U.S. patents, 63 U.S. registered trademarks, 98 foreign patents, and 278 foreign registered trademarks, and also have numerous patents and trademarks pending. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. Axon has the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “TASER.com”, “Axon.com”, “Axon.net”, “Evidence.com” and “Axon.io.”
Confidentiality agreements are used with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets. 
Research and Development
Our R&D initiatives focus on next generation technology. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Our investment in internally funded research and development totaled $55.4 million, $30.6 million and $23.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Within the Software and Sensors segment, the Company's team of application developers conduct R&D initiatives for cloud applications, wearable and mobile technologies in law enforcement, focused specifically on new revenue opportunities that align with our Software and Sensors product and services solutions.
Within the TASER Weapons segment, current R&D initiatives include bio-medical research and electrical, mechanical and software engineering. We expect that future CEW development projects will focus on extending the range, reducing the size, improving the functionality and developing new delivery options for our products.
Our return on investment is intended to be realized over the long-term, although new systems and technologies often can have a more immediate impact on our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 949 full-time employees and 146 temporary employees. The breakdown of our full-time employees by department was as follows: 354 direct manufacturing employees, 600 administrative and manufacturing support employees and 141 employees within sales, marketing, communications and training. Of the 146 temporary employees, more than 91% worked in direct manufacturing roles. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
