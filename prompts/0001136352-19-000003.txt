connects to our COLT Hub through the Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (Kinder Morgan) Double H Pipeline system and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (Marathon) crude oil pipeline systems, as well as to Patoka, Illinois and Gulf Coast markets through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) interstate pipeline system.  The Arrow system consists of approximately 691 miles of low-pressure gathering pipelines, a 23-acre central delivery point with 266,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity and multiple pipeline take-away outlets, and salt water disposal wells. During 2018, we completed the construction of a natural gas processing facility (Bear Den) and associated pipelines, and began construction of the Bear Den Plant Phase 2 expansion that will increase processing capacity to 150 MMcf/d. The Phase 2 expansion is expected to be in service by the third quarter of 2019. Our operations are anchored by long-term gathering contracts and our underlying contracts largely provide for fixed-fee gathering services with annual escalators for crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services. 
Marcellus
We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison and Doddridge Counties, West Virginia. These systems consist of 74 miles of low pressure gathering lines and nine compression and dehydration stations with 131,380 horsepower. Through these systems, we provide midstream services under long-term, fixed-fee contracts across two operating areas: our eastern area of operation (East AOD), where we are the exclusive gatherer, and our western area of operation (Western Area), where we provide compression services.
In the East AOD, we provide gathering, dehydration and compression services on a fixed-fee basis. We gather and ultimately redeliver our customers’ natural gas to MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.’s Sherwood gas processing plant and various regional pipeline systems. In the Western Area, we provide compression and dehydration services on a fixed-fee basis predominantly utilizing our West Union and Victoria compressor stations, each with a maximum capacity of 120 MMcf/d. Our agreements provide for a minimum volume commitment of approximately 50% of the throughput capacity of each compressor station through 2021.
Barnett
We own and operate three systems in the Barnett Shale, including the Cowtown, Lake Arlington and the Alliance systems. Our Cowtown system, which is located principally in the southern portion of the Fort Worth, Texas Basin, consists of pipelines that gather rich gas produced by customers and deliver the volumes to our plants for processing and the Cowtown plant, which includes two natural gas processing units that extract NGLs from the natural gas stream and deliver customers’ residue gas and extracted NGLs to unaffiliated pipelines for sale downstream. Our Lake Arlington system, which is located in eastern Tarrant County, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and related dehydration and compression facilities. Our Alliance system, which is located in northern Tarrant and southern Denton Counties, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and a related dehydration, compression and amine treating facility.

(Shell Midstream), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, owns the remaining 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian Basin. Crestwood Permian Basin has a long-term agreement with SWEPI LP (SWEPI), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, to own and operate the Nautilus gathering system in SWEPI’s operated position in the Delaware Permian. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood Permian Basin the gathering rights for SWEPI’s gas production across a large acreage position in Loving, Reeves and Ward Counties, Texas. The Nautilus gathering system includes 59 receipt point meters, 133 miles of pipeline, a 41-mile high pressure header system, 37,400 horsepower of compression and four high pressure delivery points. Crestwood Permian Basin provides gathering, dehydration, compression and liquids handling services to SWEPI under a 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement. 
In July 2018, a subsidiary of Crestwood Permian purchased an undivided interest in 80,000 Bbls/d of capacity in a segment of the Epic Y-Grade Pipeline, LP (EPIC) pipeline from Orla, Texas to Benedum, Texas, where the pipeline interconnects with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP’s (Chevron Phillips) pipeline. Contemporaneous with this transaction, the subsidiary of Crestwood Permian also entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Chevron Phillips to sell a dedicated volume of barrels to be delivered off the EPIC pipeline to Chevron Phillips’ pipeline. Our ownership in the EPIC pipeline provides a competitive NGL takeaway solution to continue growing our G&P footprint in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, going forward, we are positioned to securely and economically move Orla NGL products into Gulf Coast markets which provides our customers optionality and flow assurance that creates a unique competitive advantage for us.
Powder River Basin
Our gathering and processing segment includes our 50% equity interest in the Jackalope joint venture with Williams Partners LP (Williams), which we account for under the equity method of accounting. The joint venture, operated by Williams, owns the Jackalope gas gathering system, which serves a 358,000 gross acre dedication operated by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake) in Converse County, Wyoming. The Jackalope system consists of approximately 211 miles of gathering pipelines, 50,895 horsepower of compression and a 145 MMcf/d processing plant (Bucking Horse). The system connects to 102 well pads and is supported by a 20-year gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake that includes minimum revenue guarantees for a five to seven year period. In addition, Jackalope is expanding its gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant to increase processing capacity to 345 MMcf/d in late 2019/early 2020. The Phase 2 Jackalope expansion also includes gathering, compression and a second processing plant which will add an additional 200 MMcf/d to the Jackalope system. See Part IV, Item 15.

(1) | Firm contracts represent take-or-pay contracts whereby our customers agree to pay for a specified amount of storage or transportation capacity, whether or not the capacity is utilized. Fixed-fee contracts represent contracts in which our customers agree to pay a flat rate based on the amount of commodity delivered. 


(2) | Mixed contracts include both firm and fixed-fee arrangements.

The cash flows from our S&T operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with an original term ranging from 1-10 years. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are supported by take-or-pay contracts with refiners and marketers. The rates and durations of the contracts associated with our crude oil terminals have eroded as pipelines come on-line that make crude-by-rail options less economical, which impacts our cash flows from operations. Cash flows from interruptible and other hub services provided by the natural gas storage facilities and pipelines owned by our joint ventures tends to increase during the peak winter season.
Marketing, Supply and Logistics
Our MS&L segment consists of our NGL and crude marketing and logistics operations. We utilize our trucking and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted storage and pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers. 
Our NGL marketing and logistics operations primarily include:

• | A fleet of rail and rolling stock with 1,155,000 Bbls/d of NGL transportation capacity, which also includes our rail-to-truck terminals located in Florida, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.


• | A fleet of owned and leased trucks with 20,000 Bbls/d of crude oil transportation capacity and 100,000 Bbls/d of NGL transportation capacity. We provide hauling services to customers in over 30 states from New Mexico to Maine. 


• | Our Seymour and Bath storage facilities. The Seymour storage facility is located in Seymour, Indiana, and has 500,000 Bbls of underground NGL storage capacity and 29,000 Bbls of aboveground “bullet” storage capacity. The Seymour facility’s receipts and deliveries are supported by Enterprise’s TEPPCO pipeline, allowing pipeline and truck access. The Bath storage facility is located in Bath, New York and has approximately 2.0 MMBbls of underground NGL storage capacity and is supported by rail and truck terminal facilities capable of loading and unloading 23 rail cars per day and approximately 100 truck transports per day. 


• | NGL pipeline and storage capacity leased from third parties, including more than 500,000 Bbls of NGL working storage capacity at major hubs in Mt. Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas.

14

The cash flows from our marketing, supply and logistics business represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods.
Customers 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues.
Industry Background
The midstream sector of the energy industry provides the link between exploration and production and the delivery of crude oil, natural gas and their components to end-use markets. The midstream sector consists generally of gathering, processing, storage, and transportation activities. We, through our consolidated operations and our equity investments, gather crude oil and natural gas; process natural gas; fractionate NGLs; store crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and transport crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. 
The diagram below depicts the main segments of the midstream sector value chain:
Crude Oil 
Pipelines typically provide a cost-effective and safe option for shipping crude oil. Crude oil gathering systems normally comprise a network of small-diameter pipelines connected directly to the well head that transport crude oil to central receipt points or interconnecting pipelines through larger diameter trunk lines. Common carrier pipelines frequently transport crude oil from central delivery points to logistics hubs or refineries under tariffs regulated by the FERC or state authorities. Logistic hubs provide storage and connections to other pipeline systems and modes of transportation, such as railroads and trucks. Pipelines not engaged in the interstate transportation of crude may also be proprietary or leased entirely to a single customer. 
Trucking complements pipeline gathering systems by gathering crude oil from operators at remote wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems. Trucking is generally limited to low volume, short haul movements because trucking costs escalate sharply with distance, making trucking the most expensive mode of crude oil transportation. Railroads provide additional transportation capabilities for shipping crude oil between gathering storage systems, pipelines, terminals and storage centers and end-users. 
Natural Gas 
Midstream companies within the natural gas industry create value at various stages along the value chain by gathering natural gas from producers at the wellhead, processing and separating the hydrocarbons from impurities and into lean gas (primarily methane) and NGLs, and then routing the separated lean gas and NGL streams for delivery to end-markets or to the next stage of the value chain.

A significant portion of natural gas produced at the wellhead contains NGLs. Natural gas produced in association with crude oil typically contains higher concentrations of NGLs than natural gas produced from gas wells. This rich natural gas is generally not acceptable for transportation in the nation’s transmission pipeline system or for residential or commercial use. Processing plants extract the NGLs, leaving residual lean gas that meets transmission pipeline quality specifications for ultimate consumption. Processing plants also produce marketable NGLs, which, on an energy equivalent basis, typically have a greater economic value as a raw material for petrochemicals and motor gasolines than as a component of the natural gas stream.
Gathering. At the earliest stage of the midstream value chain, a network of typically small diameter pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads or pad sites in the production area. Gathering systems transport gas from the wellhead to downstream pipelines or a central location for treating and processing. Gathering systems are often designed to be highly flexible to allow gathering of natural gas at different pressures and scalable to allow for additional production and well connections without significant incremental capital expenditures. A byproduct of the gathering process is the recovery of condensate liquids, which are sold on the open market.
Compression. Gathering systems are operated at pressures intended to enable the maximum amount of production to be gathered from connected wells. Through a mechanical process known as compression, volumes of natural gas at a given pressure are compressed to a sufficiently higher pressure, thereby allowing those volumes to be delivered into a higher pressure downstream pipeline to be shipped to market. Because wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they age, it becomes necessary to add additional compression over time to maintain throughput across the gathering system.
Treating and Dehydration. Treating and dehydration involves the removal of impurities such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide that may be present when natural gas is produced at the wellhead. Impurities must be removed for the natural gas to meet the quality specifications for pipeline transportation, and end users normally cannot consume (and will not purchase) natural gas with a high level of impurities. Therefore, to meet downstream pipeline and end user natural gas quality standards, the natural gas is dehydrated to remove water and is chemically treated to separate the impurities from the natural gas stream.
Processing. Once impurities are removed, pipeline-quality residue gas is separated from NGLs. Most rich natural gas is not suitable for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use and must be processed to remove the heavier hydrocarbon components. The removal and separation of hydrocarbons during processing is possible because of the differences in physical properties between the components of the raw gas stream. There are four basic types of natural gas processing methods: cryogenic expansion, lean oil absorption, straight refrigeration and dry bed absorption. Cryogenic expansion represents the latest generation of processing, incorporating extremely low temperatures and high pressures to provide the best processing and most economical extraction.
Natural gas is processed not only to remove heavier hydrocarbon components that would interfere with pipeline transportation or the end use of the natural gas, but also to separate from the natural gas those hydrocarbon liquids that could have a higher value as NGLs than as natural gas. The principal component of residue gas is methane, although some lesser amount of entrained ethane typically remains. In some cases, processors have the option to leave ethane in the gas stream or to recover ethane from the gas stream, depending on ethane’s value relative to natural gas. The processor’s ability to “reject” ethane varies depending on the downstream pipeline’s quality specifications. The residue gas is sold to industrial, commercial and residential customers and electric utilities. 
Fractionation.  Once NGLs have been removed from the natural gas stream, they can be broken down into their base components to be useful to commercial customers. Mixed NGL streams can be further separated into purity NGL products, including ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline. Fractionation works based on the different boiling points of the different hydrocarbons in the NGL stream, and essentially occurs in stages consisting of the boiling off of hydrocarbons one by one. The entire fractionation process is broken down into steps, starting with the removal of the lighter NGLs from the stream. In general, fractionators are used in the following order: (i) deethanizer, which separates ethane from the NGL stream, (ii) depropanizer, which separates propane, (iii) debutanizer, which boils off the butanes and leaves the pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons in the NGL stream, and (iv) butane splitter (or deisobutanizer), which separates isobutanes and normal butanes.
Transportation and Storage. Once raw natural gas has been treated or processed and the raw NGL mix fractionated into individual NGL components, the natural gas and NGL components are stored, transported and marketed to end-use markets. The natural gas pipeline grid in the United States transports natural gas from producing regions to customers, such as LDCs, industrial users and electric generation facilities. 
16

Historically, the concentration of natural gas production in a few regions of the United States generally required transportation pipelines to transport gas not only within a state but also across state borders to meet national demand. However, a recent shift in supply sources, from conventional to unconventional, has affected the supply patterns, the flows and the rates that can be charged on pipeline systems. The impacts vary among pipelines according to the location and the number of competitors attached to these new supply sources. These changing market dynamics are prompting midstream companies to evaluate the construction of short-haul pipelines as a means of providing demand markets with cost-effective access to newly-developed production regions, as compared to relying on higher-cost, long-haul pipelines that were originally designed to transport natural gas greater distances across the country. 
Natural gas storage plays a vital role in maintaining the reliability of gas available for deliveries. Natural gas is typically stored in underground storage facilities, including salt dome caverns, bedded salt caverns and depleted reservoirs. Storage facilities are most often utilized by pipeline companies to manage temporary imbalances in operations; natural gas end-users, such as LDCs, to manage the seasonality and variability of demand and to satisfy future natural gas needs; and, independent natural gas marketing and trading companies in connection with the execution of their trading strategies.
Competition 
Our G&P operations compete for customers based on reputation, operating reliability and flexibility, price, creditworthiness, and service offerings, including interconnectivity to producer-desired takeaway options (i.e., processing facilities and pipelines). We face strong competition in acquiring new supplies in the production basins in which we operate, and competition customarily is impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region and fluctuations in commodity prices. Our primary competitors include other midstream companies with G&P operations and producer-owned systems, and certain competitors enjoy first-mover advantages over us and may offer producers greater gathering and processing efficiencies, lower operating costs and more flexible commercial terms. 
Natural gas storage and pipeline operators compete for customers primarily based on geographic location, which determines connectivity and proximity to supply sources and end-users, as well as price, operating reliability and flexibility, available capacity and service offerings. Our primary competitors in our natural gas storage market include other independent storage providers and major natural gas pipelines with storage capabilities embedded within their transmission systems. Our primary competitors in the natural gas transportation market include major natural gas pipelines and intrastate pipelines that can transport natural gas volumes between interstate systems. Long-haul pipelines often enjoy cost advantages over new pipeline projects with respect to options for delivering greater volumes to existing demand centers, and new projects and expansions proposed from time to time may serve the markets we serve and effectively displace the service we provide to customers. 
Our crude oil rail terminals primarily compete with crude oil pipelines and other midstream companies that own and operate rail terminals in the markets we serve. The crude oil logistics business is characterized by strong competition for supplies, and competition is based largely on customer service quality, pricing, and geographic proximity to customers and other market hubs. 
Our NGL marketing and logistics business competes primarily with integrated major oil companies, refiners and processors, and other energy companies that own or control transportation and storage assets that can be optimized for supply, marketing and logistics services. 
Regulation
Our operations and investments are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, impacts our profitability. In general, midstream companies have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years.
Pipeline and Underground Storage Safety 
We are subject to pipeline safety regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and storage facilities. All of our natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and all of our NGL and crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA as hazardous liquids pipelines under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). 
17

These federal statutes and PHMSA implementing regulations collectively impose numerous safety requirements on pipeline operators, such as the development of a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs. For example, pursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. The integrity management programs govern pipeline operators’ actions in high-consequence areas, such as areas of high population and areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage. Specifically, integrity management programs require more frequent inspections and other preventative measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas. 
We plan to continue testing under our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Notwithstanding our preventive and investigatory maintenance efforts, we may incur significant expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or due to the implementation of more stringent pipeline safety standards resulting from new or amended legislation. For example, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act), which requires increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids transportation pipelines. Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. More recently, in June 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act) was passed, extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. This final rule has not been issued under the current administration. The interim rule remains in effect. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in October 2016, to implement the agency's expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
Furthermore, PHMSA is considering changes to its natural gas pipeline regulations to, among other things: (i) expand the scope of high consequence areas; (ii) strengthen integrity management requirements applicable to existing operators; (iii) strengthen or expand non-integrity pipeline management standards relating to such matters as valve spacing, automatic or remotely-controlled valves, corrosion protection, and gathering lines; and (iv) add new regulations to govern underground facilities that are not currently subject to federal regulation. See “We may incur higher costs as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and additional safety legislation,” under Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on PHMSA rulemaking. We cannot predict the final outcome of these legislative or regulatory efforts or the precise impact that compliance with any resulting new safety requirements may have on our business and investments. 
Future environmental regulatory developments, such as more strict environmental laws or regulations, or more stringent enforcement of the existing regulatory requirements could also directly affect our operations and investments. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage facilities. These standards will require the use of certain specific emissions control practices, thereby requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps, as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of these 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 standards but has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the 2016 standards are currently in effect. 
States are also expected to implement their own rules, which could be more stringent than federal requirements. In matters that could have an indirect adverse effect on our business by decreasing demand for the services that we offer, the EPA has completed a study of potential adverse impacts that certain drilling methods (including hydraulic fracturing) may have on water quality and public health, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Congress has also considered but not adopted, and several states have proposed or enacted, legislation or regulations imposing more stringent or costly requirements for exploration and production companies to develop and produce hydrocarbons.
18

States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate pipelines, but most states are certified by the Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate pipelines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. Our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements, and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. 
Natural Gas Gathering 
Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline, and not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation. The FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided are not exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, the services provided by such facility would be subject to FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer, or one source of supply over another source of supply, and generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
The states in which we operate gathering systems have adopted a form of complaint-based regulation, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. To date, these regulations have not had an adverse effect on our systems. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future, however, a failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.
In Texas, we have filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) to establish rates and terms of service for certain of our pipelines. Our assets in Texas include intrastate common carrier NGL pipelines subject to the regulation of the TRRC, which requires that our NGL pipelines file tariff publications containing all the rules and the regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform. NGL pipeline rates may be limited to provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services.
NGL Storage 
Our NGL storage terminals are subject primarily to state and local regulation. For example, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INDNR) and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) have jurisdiction over the underground storage of NGLs and NGL related well drilling, well conversions and well plugging in Indiana and New York, respectively. Thus, the INDNR regulates aspects of our Seymour facility, and the NYSDEC regulates aspects of the Bath facility. 
Crude Oil Transportation
The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an interstate basis is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs 
19

stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. The ICA and FERC regulations also require that such rates be just and reasonable, and to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so as to not confer undue preference upon any shipper. The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an intrastate basis is subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Intrastate common carriers must also offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. Our crude oil pipelines in North Dakota are not common carrier pipelines and, therefore, are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC or any state regulatory commission. We cannot, however, provide assurance that the FERC will not, at some point, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of our crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or are otherwise not exempt from the FERC’s filing or reporting requirements, or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations. In the event the FERC were to determine that these crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or otherwise would not qualify for a waiver from the FERC’s applicable regulatory requirements, we would likely be required to (i) file a tariff with the FERC; (ii) provide a cost justification for the transportation charge; (iii) provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination; and (iv) potentially be subject to fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Certain of our crude oil operations located in North Dakota are subject to state regulation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). For example, gas conditioning requirements established by the NDIC recently will require operators of crude by rail terminals to report to the NDIC any crude volumes received for loading that exceed federal vapor pressure limits. State legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would authorize and require the NDIC to promulgate regulations under which produced water pipelines would be required to, among other things, install leak detection facilities and post bonds to cover potential remediation costs associated with releases. Moreover, the regulation of our customers’ production activities by the NDIC impacts our operations. For example, during 2016, the NDIC approved additional requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines and spill containment that became effective on October 1, 2016, while other requirements relating to bonding for underground gathering pipelines, and construction of berms around facilities became effective on January 1, 2017. Additionally, on July 1, 2014, the NDIC issued an order wherein the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” requiring our customers to capture certain percentages of natural gas produced by specified dates (Gas Capture Order). The Gas Capture Order was subsequently modified in late 2015 and late 2018. Exploration and production operators in the state may be required to install new equipment to satisfy these goals, and any failure by operators to meet these gas capture percentage goals would subject those operators to production restrictions, which could reduce the amount of commodities we gather on the Arrow system from our customers, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Portions of our Arrow gathering system, which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, may be subject to applicable regulation by the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations may apply to operators and other parties within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American lands. These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment preferences and numerous other matters.
Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM. However, Native American tribes possess certain inherent authorities to enact and enforce their own internal laws and regulations as long as such laws and regulations do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations may include various fees, taxes, and requirements to extend preference in employment to tribal members or Indian owned businesses. Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation may be subject to the pertinent Native American judiciary system, or barred from litigating matters adverse to the pertinent tribe unless there is a specific waiver of the tribe’s sovereign immunity. Therefore, we may be subject to various applicable laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these applicable regulatory requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project with a Native American reservation. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights-of-way or obtain new rights-of-way in Native American lands without experiencing significant costs. For example, following a recent decision issued in May 2017 by the Federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals that relied, in part, on a previous Federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Native American landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators.
20

In recent years, PHMSA and other federal agencies have reviewed the adequacy of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail transport and, as necessary have pursued rules to better assure the safe transport of Bakken crude oil by rail. For example, in May 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, providing new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of Bakken crude oil transported. Additional proposed and final rules issued by PHMSA in July 2016 and August 2016, respectively, mandate a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029, and may expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans so that any railroad transporting a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train will have to have a current, comprehensive, written plan. We, as the owner of a Bakken crude loading terminal, may be adversely affected to the extent more stringent rail transport rules result in more significant operating costs in the shipment of Bakken crude oil by rail or as a result of delays or limitations of such shipments. 
Natural Gas Storage and Transportation 
Our equity investments’ natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under NGPSA, and all of our equity investments’ crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under HLPSA. On December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued final interim rules that impose new safety related requirements on downhole facilities (including wells, wellbore tubing and casing) of new and existing underground natural gas storage facilities. The final interim rules adopt and make mandatory two American Petroleum Institute Recommend Practices that, among other things, address construction, maintenance, risk-management and integrity-management procedures. PHMSA indicated when it issued the interim final rule that the adoption of these safety standards for natural gas storage facilities represent a first step in a multi-phase process to enhance the safety of underground natural gas storage, with more standards likely forthcoming. Most recently, in response to a petition for reconsideration of the interim final rule received in January 2017, PHMSA published a notice in June 2017, advising that the agency intends to consider the issues raised by the petitioners in a final rule, which it has not yet issued. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of any future regulatory actions in this area. To the extent we operate or manage natural gas storage facilities owned by our equity investments, we have evaluated the final interim rules and do not anticipate any significant impact on our equity investments or any significant increase in the costs of operating and maintaining natural gas storage facilities. 
The interstate natural gas storage and transportation operations of our equity investments are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act. Subsidiaries of our Stagecoach Gas and Tres Holdings joint ventures are regulated by the FERC as natural gas companies. Under the Natural Gas Act, the FERC has authority to regulate natural gas transportation services in interstate commerce, which includes natural gas storage services. The FERC exercises jurisdiction over (i) rates charged for services and the terms and conditions of service; (ii) the certification and construction of new facilities; (iii) the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; (iv) the maintenance of accounts and records; (v) the acquisition and disposition of facilities; (vi) standards of conduct between affiliated entities; and (vii) various other matters. Regulated natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates determined by the FERC to be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory, and both the existing tariff rates and the proposed rates of regulated natural gas companies are subject to challenge.
The rates and terms and conditions of our natural gas storage and transportation equity investments are found in the FERC-approved tariffs of (i) Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company LLC (Stagecoach Pipeline), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stagecoach Gas that owns the Stagecoach natural gas storage facility, the North-South Facilities and the MARC I Pipeline, (ii) Arlington Storage Company, LLC (Arlington Storage), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stagecoach Gas that owns the Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben natural gas storage facilities, and (iii) Tres Palacios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tres Holdings that owns the Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility. Stagecoach Pipeline, Arlington Storage and Tres Palacios are authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for storage services, and Stagecoach Pipeline is authorized to charge and collect negotiated rates for transportation services. Market-based and negotiated rate authority allows our equity investments to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand. A loss of market-based or negotiated rate authority or any successful complaint or protest against the rates charged or provided by our equity investments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act to (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules, regulations and orders, up to approximately $1.2 million per day per violation.
21

The interstate natural gas storage operations of our equity investments are also subject to non-rate regulation by various state agencies. For example, the NYSDEC has jurisdiction over well drilling, conversion and plugging in New York.  The NYSDEC, therefore, regulates aspects of the Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben natural gas storage facilities.
Marketing, Supply and Logistics
The transportation of crude oil, water and NGLs by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations, which are administered by the United States Department of Transportation, cover the transportation of hazardous materials. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
Our operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject to stringent federal, state, regional and local laws and regulations governing the discharge and emission of pollutants into the environment, environmental protection, or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on our operations, including (i) the need to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; (iii) apply workplace health and safety standards for the benefit of employees; (iv) require remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and (v) impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the (i) assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; (ii) imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; (iii) occurrence of delays in permitting or the development of projects; and (iv) issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the activities in a particular area.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing federal environmental laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject:

• | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes strict liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;


• | The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes;


• | The Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements and which serves as a legal basis for the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;


• | The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters;


• | The Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of substances into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;


• | The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments or the more detailed Environmental Impact Statements, may be made available for public review and comment;


• | The Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered or threatened species, or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and


• | The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.

Certain of these federal environmental laws, as well as their state counterparts, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the 
22

harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Accordingly, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up or remediating contamination arising out of our operations or as a result of activities by others who previously occupied or operated on properties now owned or leased by us. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease and facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We may not be able to recover some or any of these additional costs from insurance.
During 2014, we experienced three releases on our Arrow produced water gathering system that resulted in approximately 28,000 barrels of produced water being released on lands within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In May 2015, we experienced another release of approximately 5,200 barrels of produced water. We have substantially completed our remediation efforts for the spills, and we believe our remediation costs will be recoverable under our insurance policies.
In April 2015, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violation (NOPV) under the Clean Water Act relating to the largest of the 2014 water releases. We responded to the NOPV in May 2015, and in April 2017, we entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (the Order) with the EPA. The Order requires us to continue to remediate and monitor the impacted area for no less than four years unless all goals of the Order are satisfied earlier. On December 13, 2017, the EPA and Crestwood signed a Combined Complaint and Consent Agreement (CCCA) whereby we agreed to pay a civil penalty of $49,000 to the EPA and purchase emergency response equipment at an estimated cost of approximately $173,000 for the Three Affiliated Tribes as a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP). The CCCA and SEP concludes the EPA’s penalty phase related to this matter.
In March 2015, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office in Bismarck, North Dakota, seeking documents and information relating to the largest of the three 2014 water releases. In September 2017, we received a notice from the United States Department of Justice that it completed the investigation with no charges being filed against us. 
In August 2015, we received a notice of violation from the Three Affiliated Tribes’ Environmental Division related to our 2014 produced water releases on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The notice of violation imposes fines and requests reimbursements exceeding $1.1 million; however, the notice of violation was stayed in September 2015, upon our posting of a performance bond for the amount contemplated by the notice and pending the outcome of settlement discussions with the EPA related to the NOPV. Although we continue to have productive settlement conversations with the Tribe, we cannot predict if or when we will be able to settle this matter.
Employees
As of February 11, 2019, we had 859 full-time employees, 336 of which were general and administrative employees and 523 of which were operational employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
