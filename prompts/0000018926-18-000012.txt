ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing an integrated array of services to our business and residential customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance voice, virtual private network ("VPN") data network, private line (including business data services), Ethernet, information technology, wavelength, broadband, colocation and data center services, managed services, professional and other services provided in connection with selling equipment, network security and various other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.
With approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we believe we are among the largest providers of communications services to global enterprise customers. Our terrestrial and subsea fiber optic long-haul network throughout North America, Europe and Latin America connects to metropolitan fiber networks that we operate. We operate in over 60 countries, with the substantial majority of our revenues being derived in the United States. 
Based on our approximately 10.3 million total access lines at December 31, 2017, we believe we are the third largest wireline telecommunications company in the United States. We operate nearly 75% of our total access lines in portions of Colorado, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Oregon, Iowa, Utah, New Mexico, Missouri, and Idaho, and we also provide local service in portions of 25 other states. In the portion of the 37 states where we have local access lines, which we refer to as our local service area, we are the incumbent local telephone company.
At December 31, 2017, we served approximately 5.7 million broadband subscribers.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Louisiana in 1968. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyLink Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318) 388-9000.
For a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of this report. The summary financial information in this Item 1 should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 8 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Acquisition of Level 3
On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink acquired Level 3 through successive merger transactions, including a merger of Level 3 with and into a merger subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary under the name of Level 3 Parent, LLC. As a result of the acquisition, Level 3 shareholders received $26.50 per share in cash and 1.4286 of CenturyLink common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, for each outstanding share of Level 3 common stock they owned at closing, subject to certain limited exceptions. Upon closing, CenturyLink shareholders owned approximately 51% and former Level 3 shareholders owned approximately 49% of the combined company.
In addition, each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted prior to April 1, 2014 or granted to an outside director of Level 3 was converted into $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) with respect to each Level 3 share covered by such award (the "Converted RSU Awards"). Each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted on or after April 1, 2014 (other than those granted to outside directors of Level 3) was converted into a CenturyLink restricted stock unit award using a conversion ratio of 2.8386 to 1 as determined in accordance with a formula set forth in the merger agreement (“the Continuing RSU Awards”).
Our preliminary estimate of the amount of aggregate consideration of $19.617 billion is based on:

• | the 517.3 million shares of CenturyLink’s common stock (including those issued in connection with the Converted RSU Awards) issued to consummate the acquisition and the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock at October 31, 2017 of $18.99;

4


• | the cash consideration of $26.50 per share on the 362.1 common shares of Level 3 issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2017, and the cash consideration of $1 million paid on the Converted RSUs awards;


• | the estimated value of $136 million of the Continuing RSU Awards, which represents the pre-combination portion of Level 3’s share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink; and


• | the estimated liability of $60 million for the dissenting common shares issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2017.

For additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see (i) Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, (ii) our current report on Form 8-K/A filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on January 16, 2018, (iii) our current report on Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on November 1, 2017 and (iv) the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by us with the SEC on February 13, 2017.
Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business 
On May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital ("the Purchaser") in exchange for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion and a minority stake in the limited partnership that owns the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company, Cyxtera Technologies ("Cyxtera"). As part of the transaction, the Purchaser acquired 57 of our data centers and assumed $294 million (as of May 1, 2017) of our capital lease obligations related to the divested properties.
Our colocation business generated revenues (excluding revenue from affiliates) of $210 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, and $622 million and $626 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively (a small portion of which has been retained by us). 
See Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of
this report for additional information.

(1) | The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion.


(2) | During 2017 and 2016, we incurred Level 3 acquisition-related expenses of $271 million and $52 million, respectively. For additional information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisition of Level 3" and Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.


(3) | In 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-07, "Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost" by retrospectively applying the requirements of the ASU to our previously issued consolidated financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 increased operating income and increased total other expense, net by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and reduced operating income and decreased total other expense, net by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.


(4) | During 2016, we recognized $189 million of severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits associated with our workforce reductions.

Operational metrics: | | | | 
Total access lines(1) | 10,282 | | 11,090 | | 11,748
Total broadband subscribers(1) | 5,662 | | 5,945 | | 6,048 

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | Access lines are lines reaching from the customers' premises to a connection with the public network and broadband subscribers are customers that purchase broadband connection service through their existing telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access lines and broadband subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. We count lines when we install the service.

Our methodology for counting access lines and broadband subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies.
We estimate that during 2017 approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues was derived from providing telecommunications, colocation and hosting services outside the United States.
Operations
Segments
In January 2017, we implemented a new organization structure designed to further strengthen our ability to attain our operational, strategic and financial goals. Prior to this reorganization, we operated and reported as two segments, business and consumer. As a result of this reorganization, we changed the name of the predecessor business segment to "enterprise" segment. Additionally, we also reassigned our information technology, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network services from our business segment to a new non-reportable operating segment. We reported two segments, enterprise and consumer, from January 2017 through October 2017. 
In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 (discussed further in Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3), effective November 1, 2017, we implemented a new organization structure and began managing our operations in two segments: business and consumer. Our consumer segment remains substantially unchanged under this reorganization, and our newly reorganized business segment includes the legacy CenturyLink enterprise segment operations and the legacy Level 3 operations. In addition, we reassigned our information technology, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network operations back into the business segment from the former non-reportable operating segment. At December 31, 2017, we had the following two segments:
6


• | Business Segment. This segment consists generally of providing products and services to small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and government customers, including other communication providers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our local and long-distance voice, VPN data network, private line (including business data services), Ethernet, information technology, wavelength, broadband, colocation and data center services, managed services, professional and other services provided in connection with selling equipment, network security and various other ancillary services, all of which are described further under "Products and Services"; and


• | Consumer Segment. This segment consists generally of providing products and services to residential customers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, local and long-distance voice, video and other ancillary services.

The following table shows the composition of our operating revenues by segment under our current segment categorization for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: 
 | Years Ended December 31, | | Percent Change
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2017 vs 2016 | | 2016 vs 2015

For additional information on our segment data, including information on certain centrally-managed assets and expenses not reflected in our segment results, see Note 14—Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Products and Services
In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, we have revised the way we categorize our products and services and report our related revenues under the following categories: IP and data services, transport and infrastructure, voice and collaboration, IT and managed services and regulatory revenues, each of which is described in further detail below. From time to time, we change the categorization of our products and services, and we may make similar changes in the future.
We offer our customers the ability to bundle together several products and services. For example, our customers can bundle two or more services such as broadband, video (including DIRECTV through our strategic partnership) and voice services. We believe our customers value the convenience and price discounts associated with receiving multiple services through a single company.
Described in greater detail below are our primary products, services and revenue sources.
IP and Data Services

• | VPN Data Network. Built on our optical transport network, we offer customers the ability to create private point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and full-mesh networks. These services allow service providers, enterprises and government entities to replace multiple networks with a single, cost-effective solution that simplifies the transmission of voice, video, and data over a single or converged network, while delivering high quality of service and security;


• | Ethernet. Ethernet services include point-to-point and multi-point equipment configurations that facilitate data transmissions across metropolitan areas and wide area networks. Ethernet services are also used to provide transmission services to wireless service providers that use our fiber-optic cables connected to their towers;


• | Internet Protocol ("IP"). Our IP services deliver a broad range of IP transit and network interconnection solutions for high bandwidth users; and

7


• | Video. Our video services include our facilities-based video, marketed as CenturyLink Prism TV, which is a premium entertainment service that allows our customers to watch hundreds of television or cable channels and record up to four shows on one home digital video recorder. In addition, we offer various broadcast services, marketed as Vyvx, to provide audio and video feeds over fiber or satellite for broadcast and production customers. These services vary in capacity provided, frequency of use (that is, may be provided on an occasional or dedicated basis) and price. We also offer satellite digital television under an arrangement with DIRECTV that allows us to market, sell and bill for its services under its brand name.

Transport and Infrastructure

• | Broadband. Our broadband services allow customers to connect at high speeds to the Internet through their existing telephone lines or fiber-optic cables. A substantial portion of our broadband subscribers are located within the local service area of our wireline telephone operations;


• | Private Line. A private line (including business data services) is a direct circuit or channel specifically dedicated for the purpose of directly connecting two or more sites. Private line service offers a high-speed, secure solution for frequent transmission of large amounts of data between sites, including wireless backhaul transmissions;


• | Colocation and Data Center Services. Our colocation and data center services include data center facilities that we acquired from Level 3 and services including cloud, hosting, and application management solutions. Our data center services range from dedicated hosting and cloud services to more complex managed solutions, including disaster recovery, business continuity, applications management support and security services to manage mission critical applications;


• | Wavelength. Our wavelength services provide our customers that require significant amounts of bandwidth with an end-to-end transport solution of a fixed amount of bandwidth with Ethernet solutions;


• | Equipment Sales and Professional Services. Our equipment sales and professional services include the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related products and professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment, the building of proprietary fiber-optic broadband networks for our government and business customers and the reselling of software; and


• | Network Security Services. Our network security solutions are designed to address the escalating risk of cyber-attacks by assisting customers in establishing a secure network to safeguard brand value, to enable business continuity, and to avoid complexity and cost. Our network security services include adaptive network security, adaptive threat intelligence, network-based distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation and professional security services for governance, risk management, and compliance. Our network security services are sold stand-alone or in conjunction with IP and data services.

Voice and Collaboration

• | Local Voice Services. We offer local calling services for our residential and business customers within the local service area of our wireline markets, generally for a fixed monthly charge. These services include a number of enhanced calling features and other services, such as call forwarding, caller identification, conference calling, voice mail, selective call ringing and call waiting, for which we generally charge an additional monthly fee. We also generate revenues from non-recurring services, such as inside wire installation, maintenance services, service activation and reactivation;


• | Long-distance Voice Services. We offer our residential and business customers domestic and international long-distance services and toll-free services. Our international long-distance services include voice calls that either terminate or originate with our customers in the United States; and


• | Wholesale Voice Services. For our wholesale customers, our local calling service offerings include primarily the resale of our voice services and the sale of unbundled network elements ("UNEs") and toll free service. These services share many of the same features as the local voice services described above and frequently permit other carriers to terminate voice services transmitted in part on other carriers' networks. We offer wholesale long distance services, which include domestic and international voice termination services targeted to interexchange carriers, wireless providers, local phone companies, cable companies, resellers and voice over IP providers. Our wholesale toll free service terminates toll free calls that are originated on the traditional telephone network. Customers for these services include call centers, conferencing providers, and voice over IP providers.

8

IT and Managed Services

• | Information Technology ("IT") Services. Our IT-based services focus primarily on the transport and delivery of enterprise data and applications; and


• | Managed Services. Managed services represents a blend of network, hosting, cloud, and IT services that typically require ongoing support from our staff. These services frequently involve equipment or networks owned, acquired or controlled by the customer and often include consulting or software development.

Regulatory Revenues

• | Universal Service Fund ("USF") support payments. We receive federal and state USF support payment subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from our customers;


• | Connect America Fund ("CAF"). We receive federal support payments from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the CAF program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in 33 states; and


• | Other. We generate other operating revenues from the leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties and from rental income associated with our failed-sale-leaseback. For additional information on our failed-leaseback transaction, see "Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.

Because we centrally manage the activities that generate these regulatory revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues.
Additional Information
From time to time, we also make investments in other communications or technology companies.
For further information on regulatory, technological and competitive changes that could impact our revenues, see "Regulation" and "Competition" under this Item 1 below and "Risk Factors" under Item 1A below. For more information on the financial contributions of our various services, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Network 
Most of our products and services are provided using our telecommunications network, which consists of voice switches, data switches and routers, high-speed transport equipment, fiber-optic and copper cables and other equipment. Our local exchange carrier networks also include central offices and remote site assets, and form a portion of the public switched telephone network. A substantial portion of our equipment operates with licensed software. 
At December 31, 2017, our network included:

• | Approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic plant;


• | Approximately 900,000 miles of copper plant;


• | More than 360 colocation facilities and data centers globally;


• | Approximately 37,500 route miles of subsea fiber optic cable systems; and


• | Multiple gateway and transmission facilities used in connection with operating our network throughout North America, Europe and Latin America.

We continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying various technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. Rapid and significant changes in technology are expected to continue in the telecommunications industry. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and customer demands, including demands for enhanced digitization, automation and customer self-service capabilities. In addition, we anticipate that continued increases in internet usage by our customers will require us to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity or to implement network management practices to alleviate network capacity shortages. The FCC's definition of broadband service could create additional requirements for higher capital spending to address marketing and competitive issues. Any such additional expenditure could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Similarly, we continue to take steps to simplify and modernize our network, much of which we have assembled through acquisitions. To attain our objectives, we plan to continue to undertake several complex projects that we expect will be costly and may take several years to complete. The costs of these projects could materially increase if we conclude that we need to replace any or all of our legacy systems.
Like other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees, which has caused us to spend increasingly more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks. Some of the attacks result in security breaches, and we periodically notify our customers, our employees or the public of these breaches when necessary or appropriate. None of these resulting security breaches to date have materially adversely affected our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We rely on several other communications companies to provide our offerings. We lease a significant portion of our core fiber network from our competitors and other third parties. Many of these leases will lapse in future years. All of our satellite television and wireless voice services are provided by other carriers under agency agreements, and some of our other services are reliant upon reselling arrangements with other carriers. Our future ability to provide services on the terms of our current offerings will depend in part upon our ability to renew or replace these leases, agreements and arrangements on terms substantially similar to those currently in effect.
For additional information regarding our systems, network, cyber risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see "Risk Factors," generally, in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and, in particular, "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" and "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources." For more information on our properties, see "Properties" in Item 2 of Part I of this report.
Patents, Trade Names, Trademarks and Copyrights
Either directly or through our subsidiaries, we have rights in various patents, trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property necessary to conduct our business, such as our CenturyLink® and Prism® brand names. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others as we deem appropriate.
Our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services to content distribution to transmission and networking equipment. Patents give us the right to prevent others, particularly competitors, from using our proprietary technologies. Patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patent that has been licensed to us. We plan to continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices, or are named in lawsuits, alleging that our products or services infringe on patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. In certain instances, these matters can potentially adversely impact our operations, operating results or financial position. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business” in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.

Sales and Marketing
We maintain local offices in most major and secondary markets within the U.S. and in most of the larger population centers within our local service area. In addition, we maintain offices within the primary markets of the more than 60 countries in which we operate. These offices provide sales and customer support services to the communities in our local markets. We also rely on our call center personnel and a variety of channel partners to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. Our sales and marketing strategy is to enhance our sales by offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customers and promoting our brands. Our offerings include both stand-alone services and bundled services designed to meet the needs of different customer segments.
We conduct most of our operations under the brand name "CenturyLink." Our satellite television service is offered on a co-branded basis under the "DIRECTV" name. Our switched digital television service offering is branded under the name "Prism TV." 
Our sales and marketing approach to our residential customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, local retail stores, telemarketing and third parties, including retailers, satellite television providers, door to door sales agents and digital marketing firms. We support our distribution with digital marketing, direct mail, bill inserts, newspaper and television advertising, website promotions, public relations activities and sponsorship of community events and sports venues.
Similarly, our sales and marketing approach to our business customers includes a commitment to provide comprehensive communications and IT solutions for business, wholesale and government customers of all sizes, ranging from small business offices to the world's largest global enterprise customers. We strive to offer our business customers stable, reliable, secure and trusted solutions. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including telecommunications agents, system integrators, value-added resellers and other telecommunications firms. We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, television advertising, website promotions and public relations.
Regulation
Overview
Our domestic operations are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), various state utility commissions and occasionally by local agencies. Our non-domestic operations are regulated by supranational groups (such as the European Union), national agencies and, often, state, provincial or local bodies. 
Our domestic operations are subject to significant regulation by the FCC, which regulates interstate communications, and state utility commissions, which regulate intrastate communications. These agencies (i) issue rules to protect consumers and promote competition, (ii) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, and (iii) have traditionally developed and administered support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas. In most states, local voice service, switched and business data services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region. In addition, we are required to maintain licenses with the FCC and with state utility commissions. Laws and regulations in many states restrict the manner in which a licensed entity can interact with affiliates, transfer assets, issue debt and engage in other business activities. Many acquisitions and divestitures require approval by the FCC and some state commissions. These agencies typically have the authority to withhold their approval, or to request or impose substantial conditions upon the transacting parties in connection with granting their approvals.
The following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that affect our operations, but numerous other regulations not discussed below could also impact us. Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial, legislative and administrative proceedings which could substantially change the manner in which the domestic and international communications industry operates and the amount of revenues we receive for our services. Neither the outcome of these proceedings, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
The laws and regulations governing our affairs are quite complex and occasionally in conflict with each other. From time to time, we are fined for failing to meet applicable regulations or service requirements.

Federal Regulation of Domestic Operations
General
The 2016 U.S. Presidential election ushered in a new Administration with a more deregulatory agenda. The industry is undergoing rapid change, driven mostly by evolving technology and the emergence of a variety of new competitors. Cybersecurity and consumer privacy now dominate policy discussions. Much of our domestic operations are still required to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which materially amended the Communications Act of 1934, primarily to promote competition. Among other things, those laws regulate the terms and conditions under which we provide interstate communications services and require our incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILECs") to offer various of our traditional wireline services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms.
The FCC regulates interstate services we provide, including the business data service charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and the interstate access charges that we bill to long-distance companies and other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates a number of aspects of our business related to privacy, homeland security and network infrastructure, including our access to and use of local telephone numbers and our provision of emergency 911 services. The FCC has responsibility for maintaining and administering support programs designed to expand nationwide access to communications services (which are described further below), as well as other programs supporting service to low-income households, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. Changes in the composition of the five members of the FCC or its Chairman can have significant impacts on the regulation of our business.
In recent years, our operations and those of other telecommunications carriers have been further impacted by legislation, merger-related conditions and regulation imposing additional obligations on us, particularly with regards to providing voice and broadband service, bolstering homeland security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts and enhancing privacy. These laws include the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, and laws governing local telephone number portability and customer proprietary network information requirements. In addition, the FCC has heightened its focus on the reliability of emergency 911 services. The FCC has imposed fines on us and other companies for 911 outages and has adopted new compliance requirements for providing 911 services. We are incurring capital and operating expenses designed to comply with the FCC's 911 requirements and minimize future outages. All of these laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional costs and could impact our ability to compete effectively against companies not subject to the same regulations.
Over the past several years, the FCC has taken various actions and initiated certain proceedings designed to comprehensively evaluate the proper regulation of the provisions of data services to businesses. As part of its evaluation, the FCC has reviewed the rates, terms and conditions under which these services are provided. The FCC's proceedings remain pending, and their ultimate impact on us is currently unknown.
In 2015, the FCC issued an order regulating the manner in which ILECs can discontinue or reduce certain copper-based services. This order is under review by the current FCC but still requires ILECs to provide prior notice to certain customers of their proposed change in services, and in certain cases to provide replacement offerings on reasonably comparable terms and conditions. We expect that this order may limit our flexibility to react to changing conditions in the communications industry and introduce services such as Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") services.
Intercarrier Compensation and Universal Service
For decades, the FCC has regularly considered various intercarrier compensation reforms, generally with a goal to create a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, or carrying telecommunications traffic. The FCC has also traditionally administered support programs designed to promote the deployment of voice and broadband services in high-cost rural areas of the country.
In October 2011, the FCC adopted the Connect America and Intercarrier Compensation Reform order ("the 2011 order"), intended to reform the existing regulatory regime to recognize ongoing shifts to new technologies, including VoIP, and to re-direct universal service funding to foster nationwide broadband coverage. The 2011 order provides for a multi-year transition as terminating intercarrier compensation charges are reduced, universal service funding is explicitly targeted to broadband deployment, and line charges paid by end user customers are increased. These changes have increased the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues related to our wholesale services, while creating opportunities for increased federal USF support and retail revenue.
12

In late 2011, numerous parties filed a petition for reconsideration with the FCC seeking numerous revisions to the 2011 order. Future judicial challenges to the 2011 order are also possible, which could alter or delay the FCC's proposed changes. In addition, based on the outcome of the FCC proceedings, various state commissions may consider changes to their universal service funds or intrastate access rates. Rulemakings designed to implement the order are not complete, and several FCC proceedings relating to the 2011 order remain pending. For these and other reasons, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings at this time.
As a result of the 2011 order, a new Universal Service program was created to deploy broadband to unserved and underserved rural areas utilizing the Connect America Fund or "CAF". The CAF substantially replaces interstate USF funding, that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets. There are two phases to the CAF program, CAF Phase 1, a one-time broadband grant program, and CAF Phase 2, which is a multi-year recurring subsidy program for more extensive broadband deployment in price-cap ILEC territories.
In 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states of the 37 states in which we are an ILEC under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program in these 33 states has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF high-cost program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 33 states. 
As a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments for 33 states, as well as existing merger-related commitments, we will be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build infrastructure by certain specified milestone deadlines. Future funding is contingent upon our compliance with these infrastructure buildout commitments and certain other service requirements, including certain minimum upload and download transmission speed requirements. In addition, if we are not in compliance with FCC measures at the end of the six-year CAF Phase 2 period, we will have 12 months to attain full compliance. If we are not in full compliance after the additional 12 months, we would incur a penalty equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received in the state over the six-year term, plus a potential penalty of 10% of the state's total CAF Phase 2 support over the six-year term. For information on the risks associated with participating in this program, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
For additional information about the potential financial impact of the CAF Phase 2 program, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Broadband Regulation
In February 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations to regulate Internet services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. A newly-constituted FCC voted to repeal most of those regulations in December 2017. Opponents of that change have judicially challenged this action and will likely advocate in favor of re-instituting regulation of Internet services under Title II of the Communications Act. Several states have also opposed the change and have initiated state executive orders or introduced legislation focused on state-specific Internet service regulation.
In 2015, the FCC adopted a broadband standard of 25 megabits per second download speed and 3 megabits per second of upload speed. At this time, we are not aware of any regulatory mandates requiring us to deploy this target speed. The new target is simply a benchmark by which the FCC will evaluate broadband deployment progress in the future. However, the FCC could attempt to utilize this broadband speed target in future regulatory proceedings, and our failure to attain these speeds in certain markets could place us at a marketing or financial disadvantage.
State Regulation of Domestic Operations
In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs. Nonetheless, state regulatory commissions generally continue to regulate local service rates, intrastate access charges, state universal service funds and in some cases service quality. Our ILEC operations are generally regulated under various forms of alternative regulation that typically limit our ability to increase rates for basic local voice service, but relieve us from the requirement to meet certain earnings tests. In a number of states, our ILEC operations have gained pricing freedom for the majority of retail services other than basic voice service. In most of the states in which we operate as an ILEC, we have gained pricing flexibility for certain enhanced calling services, such as caller identification and for bundled services that also include local voice service.
Under state law, our telephone operating subsidiaries are typically governed by laws and regulations that (i) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (ii) prescribe certain reporting requirements, (iii) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (iv) limit ILECs' ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (v) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vi) impose various other service standards.
13

Unlike many of our competitors which provide no ILEC services, our ILEC affiliates generally face "carrier of last resort" obligations which include an ongoing requirement to provide service to all prospective and current customers in their ILEC service area who request service and are willing to pay rates prescribed in our tariffs. In certain situations, this may constitute a competitive disadvantage to our ILEC affiliates if competitors can choose to focus on low-cost profitable customers and withhold service from high-cost unprofitable customers. On the other hand, our non-ILEC affiliates have substantial flexibility to compete against unaffiliated ILECs in other markets.
We operate in states where traditional cost recovery mechanisms, including rate structures and state USF, are under evaluation or have been modified. Recent changes to the federal tax code have prompted several states to review regulated rates. As laws and regulations change, there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to provide us with any cost recovery.
For several years, we have faced various carrier complaints, legislation or other investigations regarding our intrastate switched access rates in several of our states. The outcomes of these disputes cannot be determined at this time. If we are required to reduce our intrastate switched access rates as a result of any of these disputes or state initiatives, we will seek to recover displaced switched access revenues from state universal service funds or other services. However, the amount of such recovery, particularly from retail customers, is not assured.
International Regulations
Our subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are subject to various regulations in the markets where service is provided. Although the scope of regulation varies from country to country, a substantial portion of our foreign operations are located in Europe and Brazil, both of which are governed by detailed telecommunication regulation.
All of the countries in which we currently operate are members of the World Trade Organization, and most have committed to some deregulatory measures fostering market competition and permitting foreign ownership. Some countries now permit competition for all telecommunications facilities and services, while others allow less competition for some facilities and services, but restrict competition for other services. The telecommunications regulatory regimes of many Latin American countries are in the process of development. Many issues, such as regulation of incumbent providers, interconnection, unbundling of local loops, resale of telecommunications services, and pricing have not been addressed fully, or even at all. We cannot accurately predict whether and how these issues will be resolved, or their effect on our operations. Further, some of the legal requirements governing our foreign operations are more restrictive than or conflict with those governing our domestic operations, which raises our compliance costs and regulatory risks.
European Union
The European Union, or EU, has adopted a more systematic approach to the convergence of networks and the regulation of telecommunications services. The European Commission oversees the implementation by its Member States of various directives developed to regulate electronic communications. These directives address, among other things, (i) interconnection and access, (ii) authorization and licensing, (iii) universal service, and (iv) privacy. In November 2009, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers agreed to implement a number of changes to the existing regulation regime including, among other things, more clearly define user rights.
 In November 2015, the EU adopted Regulation EU 2015/2120 which, among other things set out new legislation in relation to open internet. The net neutrality provisions of this Regulation became effective at the beginning of the second quarter 2016. In 2015, the EU Commission also began a review of the entire suite of Directives and Regulations relating to the communications sector and proposals are currently under consideration with a view to making any changes in sufficient time to have these transposed into Member State law by 2019.
In June 2016, following a national referendum, the UK decided to cease its membership in the EU. The European Treaty sets out the legal process that must be followed to accomplish this departure. It is generally expected that the UK will remain a member of the EU until at least 2019. While there is likely to be little immediate effect for the Company or its customers, the longer term implications are presently unclear.
Brazil
Law No. 9,472, known as the General Telecommunications Law (“LGT”), provides for the organization of telecommunications services in Brazil (which includes the regulation of the performance, provision and use of services, and the implementation and operation of telecommunications networks). LGT establishes that the telecommunications policy must have as its main objectives universalization and competition in public telecommunications services. A legislative proposal currently in the Brazilian Senate may result in significant changes in the LGT, unifying private and public regimes under which the services are provided and promote a certain level of deregulation.
14

Brazil’s communications regulatory agency has generally pursued a policy of market liberalization and supported a competitive telecommunications environment. In order to foster effective competition and prohibit economic concentration in the market, the agency may establish restrictions, limits or conditions for companies, or groups of companies, regarding obtaining and transferring concessions, permits and authorizations to render telecommunications services. The agency is reviewing the regulation applied to sharing of infrastructure between sectors and inside the telecommunication sector, especially in connection with price and rules access.
A 2014 law provides for network neutrality and prohibits all those responsible for routing traffic, including broadband providers, from impairing or degrading (also known as throttling) Internet traffic to different Internet applications; prioritizing traffic or some content; or unreasonably interfering with or hindering the ability of users to access lawful content. 
Other Regulations
Our networks are subject to numerous local regulations, including codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations vary on a city-by-city, country-by-country and state-by-state basis, and may require us to pay substantial fees. To install our own fiber optic transmission facilities, we typically need to obtain rights-of-way over privately and publicly owned land. Rights-of-way that are not already secured, or which may expire and not be renewed, may not be available to us on economically reasonable or advantageous terms in the future. 
We are subject to federal and state regulations of customer service standards related to Prism TV. The FCC adopted customer service standards that we must meet in all of our Prism TV markets. The FCC has largely delegated its enforcement powers to local franchise authorities, who have the ability to adopt more stringent standards. We are subject to penalties in many of our local franchise agreements if we fail to meet applicable customer service standards. 
Various foreign, federal and state laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of consumer protection, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Various foreign, federal and state legislative or regulatory bodies have recently adopted increasingly restrictive laws or regulations governing the protection or retention of data, and others are contemplating similar actions. 
For additional information about these matters, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters” in item 1A of Part I of this report.
Competition
General
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, and we expect intense competition from a wide variety of sources under evolving market conditions to continue. In addition to competition from larger telecommunication service providers, we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, technology companies, cloud companies, broadband providers, device providers, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. Technological advances and regulatory and legislative changes have increased opportunities for a wide range of alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternate providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, the communications industry has, in recent years, experienced substantial consolidation, and some of our competitors in one or more lines of our business are generally larger, have stronger brand names, have more financial and business resources and have broader service offerings than we currently do. In certain overseas markets, we compete against national incumbent telecommunications providers and other regional or international companies that may have a longer history of providing service in the market.
We compete to provide services to business customers based on a variety of factors, including the comprehensiveness and reliability of our network, our data transmission speeds, price, the latency of our available intercity and metro routes, the scope of our integrated offerings, the reach and peering capacity of our IP network, and customer service. Depending on the applicable market and requested services, competition can be intense, especially if one or more competitors in the market have network assets better suited to the customer’s needs or are offering faster transmission speeds or lower prices.
15

Wireless telephone services are a significant source of competition with our traditional ILEC services particularly with regard to our small and medium size business customers as well as our wholesale business customers. It is increasingly common for customers to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly with younger customers who are less accustomed to using traditional wireline voice services. Technological and regulatory developments in wireless services, Wi-Fi, and other wired and wireless technologies have contributed to the development of alternatives to traditional landline voice services. Moreover, the growing prevalence of electronic mail, text messaging, social networking and similar digital non-voice communications services continues to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services. These factors have led to a long-term systemic decline in the number of our wireline voice service customers.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which obligates ILECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC's network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, imposes several duties on an ILEC if it receives a specific request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services using the ILEC's network. In addition, each ILEC is obligated to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory "unbundled" access to all aspects of the ILEC's network, (iii) offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv) permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to colocate their physical plant on the ILEC's property, or provide virtual colocation if physical colocation is not practicable. Current FCC rules require ILECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network elements, and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities-based competition.
As a result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, ILECs also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through reselling an ILEC's local services, through use of an ILEC's unbundled network elements or through their own facilities.
Technological developments have led to the development of new products and services that have reduced the demand for our traditional services, as noted above, or that compete with traditional ILEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies continue to aggressively market these services. Similarly, companies providing VoIP services provide voice communication services over the Internet which compete with our traditional telephone service and our own VoIP services. In addition, demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by advanced wireless data transmission technologies being deployed by wireless providers and by certain technologies permitting cable companies and other competitors to deliver faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours.
Similar to us, many cable, technology or other communications companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for and pricing of our services.
As both residential and business customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To succeed, we must continue to invest in our networks to ensure that they can deliver competitive services that meet these increasing bandwidth and speed requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in our business.
In addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above, ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems constructed by long distance carriers, large customers, municipalities or alternative access vendors. These systems are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of an ILEC's networks or switching services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs' local networks, either partially or completely, through various means, including the provision of business data services or independent switching services and the concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of an ILEC's access lines. We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead to decreased billable use of our networks.
Additional information about competitive pressures is located (i) under the heading "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and (ii) in the discussion immediately below, which contains more specific information on how these trends in competition have impacted our segments.
16

Business Segment 
In connection with providing services to our business customers, which includes our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and government customers, we compete against other telecommunication providers, as well as other regional, national and international carriers, other data transport providers, cable companies, CLECs and other enterprises, some of whom are substantially larger than us. Competition is based on price, bandwidth, quality and speed of service, promotions and bundled offerings. In providing broadband services, we compete primarily with cable companies, wireless providers, technology companies and other broadband service providers. We face competition in Ethernet based services in the wholesale market from cable companies and fiber based providers.
Our competitors for providing integrated data, broadband, voice services and other IT services to our business customers range from mid-sized businesses to large enterprises. Due to the size and capacity of some of these companies, our competitors may be able to offer more inexpensive solutions to our customers. To compete, we focus on providing sophisticated, secure and performance-driven services to our business customers through our global infrastructure.
The number of companies providing business services has grown and increased competition for these services, particularly with respect to smaller business customers. Many of our competitors for services we offer to our business customers are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and therefore they are able to avoid significant regulatory costs and obligations.
Our competitors for cloud, hosting, colocation and other IT services include telecommunications companies, technology companies, cloud companies, colocation companies, hardware manufacturers and system integrators that support the in-house IT operations for a business or offer outsourcing solutions. Due to the size, capacity and strategically low pricing tactics of some of these companies, our competitors may be able to offer more inexpensive solutions to our customers. The increase in recent years in the number of companies providing these services has placed substantial downward pressure on pricing for a wide range of cloud, hosting, colocation and other IT services. We believe, however, that our hybrid IT services capabilities, which offer multiple products and services (including network services), and our ability to create end-to-end integrated customer solutions, could help differentiate our products and services from those offered by competitors with a narrower range of products and services. We have remained focused on expanding our hybrid cloud capabilities through internal product development and strategic acquisitions of select startup businesses.
In addition, our voice and private line services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by product substitution, technological migration and price competition. For our wholesale customers, we will continue to be adversely affected by product substitution, technological migration, industry consolidation and mandated rate reductions. Competition for private line services is based on price, network reach and reliability, service, promotions and bundled offerings. We face significant competition for access services from CLECs, cable companies, resellers and wireless service providers as well as some of our own wholesale markets customers, many of which are deploying their own networks to provide customers with local services. By doing so, these competitors reduce revenue producing traffic on our network.
In providing equipment sales and professional services to our business customers, we compete primarily with large integrators, equipment providers and national telecommunication providers. Competition is based on package offerings, and as such our strategy is to provide these customers individualized and customizable packages that include other services. As such, in providing data integration we often face many of the same competitive pressures as we face in providing other services, as discussed above.
We expect equipment sales and professional services revenues to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as these offerings tend to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our governmental customers. We further expect the profit margins on our equipment sales and professional services offerings to continue to be lower than those of our other services.
Consumer Segment
With respect to providing our services to residential customers, competition is based on price, bandwidth, quality and speed of service, promotions and bundled offerings. Wireless carriers' latest generation technologies are allowing them to more directly compete with our services. The manner in which we compete for broadband customers in this segment is substantially similar to the manner in which we compete for business customers, as described in the above section. In reselling DIRECTV video services, we compete primarily with cable and other satellite companies as well as other sales agents and resellers. Our Prism TV residential video service faces substantial competition from a variety of competitors, including well-established cable companies, satellite companies and several national companies that deliver content over the Internet and on mobile devices. Many of our competitors for these types of services are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are, and therefore are able to avoid significant regulatory costs and obligations.
17

Our strategy for maintaining and increasing our base of broadband customers is based on pricing, packaging of services and features and quality of service. In order to remain competitive, we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important. As a result, we continue to invest in our network, which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services. We also continue to expand our marketing and product bundling efforts by offering a variety of bundled products and services with various pricing discounts, as we compete in a maturing market in which a significant portion of consumers already have broadband services. We offer these bundled products and services through various sales and marketing opportunities as further described above under the heading "Sales and Marketing."
Although our status as an ILEC in our local service areas continues to provide us advantages in providing local services in those territories, as noted above, we increasingly face significant competition as an increasing number of consumers are willing to substitute cable, wireless and electronic communications for traditional voice telecommunications services. This has led to an increase in the number and type of competitors within our industry, price compression and a decrease in our market share. As a result of this product substitution, we face greater competition in providing local and long-distance voice services from wireless providers, resellers and sales agents (including ourselves), social media hosts and broadband service providers, including cable companies. We also continue to compete with traditional telecommunications providers, such as national carriers, smaller regional providers, CLECs and independent telephone companies.
Our strategy to manage customer loss is based primarily on our pricing, packaging of services and features and quality of service. While bundle price discounts have resulted in lower average revenues for our individual services, we believe service bundles continue to positively impact our customer retention.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
We regularly evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional assets or disposing of assets in exchange for cash, securities or other properties, and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions or dispositions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement.
See above under "Acquisition of Level 3", for additional information about our November 1, 2017 acquisition of Level 3, and the "Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business", for additional information about our May 1, 2017 disposition. 
During 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of three companies for total consideration of $53 million, including future deferred or contingent cash payments of $14 million, of which $49 million has been attributed to goodwill. These acquisitions were consummated to expand the product offerings of our business segment, and therefore, the goodwill was assigned to that segment. The majority of the goodwill was attributed primarily to expected future increases in revenue from the sale of new products. The majority of the goodwill from these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. See Note 4—Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets for additional information on these acquisitions.
Environmental Compliance
From time to time we may incur environmental compliance and remediation expenses, mainly resulting from owning or operating prior industrial sites or operating vehicle fleets or power supplies for our communications equipment. Although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations or provide you with any assurances regarding the ultimate impact thereof, we do not currently believe that future environmental compliance and remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—Risks posed by other regulation" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Seasonality
Overall, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. Our network-related operating expenses are, however, generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. From time to time, weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year, but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms, including hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes in our markets along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines.
18

Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 51,000 employees, of which approximately 14,000 are members of either the Communications Workers of America ("CWA") or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW"). See the discussion of risks relating to our labor relations in "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and see Note 18—Labor Union Contracts to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information on the timing of certain contract expirations.
From time to time, we have reduced our workforce primarily due to (i) increased competitive pressures, (ii) the loss of customers and related revenues, (iii) cost reduction initiatives, (iv) process improvements through automation and (v) integration efforts from our acquisitions.

Additional factors or risks that we currently deem immaterial, that are not presently known to us or that arise in the future could also cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected results. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments, changed circumstances, or otherwise. Furthermore, any information about our intentions contained in any of our forward-looking statements reflects our intentions as of the date of such forward-looking statement, and is based upon, among other things, existing regulatory, technological, industry, competitive, economic and market conditions, and our assumptions as of such date. We may change our intentions, strategies or plans (including our dividend or other capital allocation plans) at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in our assumptions or otherwise.
Investors should also be aware that while we do, at various times, answer questions raised by securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them selectively any material non-public information or other confidential information. Accordingly, investors should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by an analyst with respect to our past or projected performance. To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility.
Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this report and other documents filed by us under the federal securities laws concerning our views and expectations regarding the communications industry are based on estimates made by us using data from industry sources, and on assumptions made by us based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate and the communications industry generally. You should be aware that we have not independently verified data from industry or other third-party sources and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness.
