ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated on August 13, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On October 4, 2021, Helix entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as may be amended and restated from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”) with MoonLake Immunotherapeutics AG, a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) registered with the commercial register of the Canton of Zug, Switzerland under the number CHE-433.093.536 (“MoonLake”), the existing securityholders of MoonLake set forth on the signature pages thereto (collectively, the “ML Parties”), Helix Holdings LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company and the sponsor of Helix (the “Sponsor”), and the representative of the ML Parties (in such capacity, the “ML Parties’ Representative”).  The terms of the Business Combination Agreement and the business combination contemplated thereby (the “Business Combination”) are discussed in more detail below. Prior to executing the Business Combination Agreement, our activities were limited to organization activities, the completion of our initial public offering, and the evaluation of possible business combination candidates. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
Formation and Initial Public Offering



On October 22, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 11,500,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” and with respect to the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Public Share, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,500,000 Public Shares, at $10.00 per Public Share, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, on August 19, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering and formation costs of the Company in consideration for 3,593,750 Class B ordinary shares. On September 30, 2020, the Sponsor surrendered, for no consideration, 718,750 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding 2,875,000 Class B ordinary shares (the “founder shares”). In September 2020, the Sponsor transferred 30,000 founder shares to each of its independent directors. The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 375,000 shares that were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised, so that the number of founder shares would equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Sponsor did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Placement Shares). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 375,000 founder shares were no longer subject to forfeiture.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 430,000 Class A Ordinary Shares (the “Private Placement Shares”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Share, to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,300,000. The Private Placement Shares are identical to the shares of Class A Ordinary Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor and its permitted transferees: (i) they may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of a business combination and (ii) they are entitled to registration rights.  



A total of $115,000,000 comprised of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares, were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of its obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the Company’s Public Shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s Public Shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, subject to applicable law. As of December 31, 2021 there was $115,042,608 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $666,790 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes.

Proposed Business Combination



On October 4, 2021, Helix entered into the Business Combination Agreement with MoonLake, the ML Parties, the Sponsor, and the ML Parties’ Representative.



Following completion (the “Closing” and the date of Closing, the “Closing Date”) of the Business Combination, (i) the existing securityholders of MoonLake (except as noted below with respect to the BVF Shareholders (as defined below)) will retain their equity interests in MoonLake and will receive a number of non-economic voting shares in Helix determined by multiplying the number of common shares of MoonLake with a par value of CFH 0.10 per share (“MoonLake Common Shares”) held by them immediately prior to the Closing by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below); (ii) the BVF Shareholders will assign all of their MoonLake Common Shares to Helix and Helix will issue to the BVF Shareholders an aggregate number of Class A Ordinary Shares (as defined below) equal to the product of such number of assigned MoonLake Common Shares and the Exchange Ratio; and (iii) Helix will receive a controlling equity interest in MoonLake in exchange for making a cash contribution in the amount of the aggregate cash available to Helix at Closing, based on the amount of cash in the Trust Account, less amounts required to satisfy redemptions and expenses, plus the aggregate proceeds of the PIPE. The “Exchange Ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing (a) 360,000,000 by (b) the fully diluted shares of MoonLake prior to the Closing by (c) 10. Substantially all of the assets and business of MoonLake and Helix will be held by MoonLake as the operating company following the Closing.



The ML Parties (other than the BVF Shareholders) will be issued, for nominal consideration, Class C ordinary shares of Helix, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class C Ordinary Shares”), with each ML Party (other than the BVF Shareholders) receiving a number of Class C Ordinary Shares equal to the number of MoonLake Common Shares it owns following a pre-Closing restructuring of MoonLake’s share capital multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Beginning six months after the Closing Date, each ML Party (other than the BVF Shareholders) will have the option to exchange its MoonLake Common Shares for a number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of MoonLake Common Shares then held by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and, upon such exchange, will surrender for no consideration a number of Class C Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Class A Ordinary Shares issued to the ML Party pursuant to the exchange.



On October 4, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Helix entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors” which include an affiliate of the Sponsor and the BVF Shareholders and their affiliates) pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for 11,500,000 Class A Ordinary Shares at a price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $115,000,000 (the “PIPE”).



At the Closing, Helix will change its name to “MoonLake Immunotherapeutics.” We anticipate the post-Business Combination equity ownership of Helix, on a fully diluted share basis, will be as follows: Helix’s public shareholders will hold approximately 18.5%, the Sponsor and initial shareholders will hold approximately 5.3%, the PIPE Investors (including an affiliate of the Sponsor and certain existing securityholders of MoonLake) will hold approximately 18.5%, and the ML Parties will hold approximately 57.8%, which pro forma ownership: assumes: (i) no holders of Helix’s Public Shares exercise their redemption rights, (ii) the exchange of MoonLake Common Shares and simultaneous surrender of Class C Ordinary Shares for Class A Ordinary Shares by the ML Parties (other than the BVF Shareholders) and calculating the Exchange Ratio based on MoonLake’s Fully Diluted Shares as of September 30, 2021, (iii) none of the parties purchase Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, and (iv) there are no other issuances of equity securities of Helix prior to or in connection with the Closing. If the maximum number of Public Shares are redeemed which would still allow Helix to satisfy the requirement that Helix have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon the Closing, such percentages will be approximately 0%, 6.5%, 22.6%, and 70.9%, respectively.



Consummation of the proposed business combination is subject to customary closing conditions and covenants of the respective parties, including approval of the Company’s shareholders. Further information regarding the proposed business combination, the proposed business of the combined company following the consummation of the Business Combination, and the risks relating to the proposed business of the combined company can be found in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 4, 2021 and the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on February 14, 2022 (the “Definitive Proxy”).

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, or an alternate initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Shares, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, other securities issuances, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity, as we plan to do in connection with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.



We entered into Subscription Agreements with certain institutional investors to raise additional funds through the PIPE in connection with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of any other initial business combination, and we may effectuate such initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we have targeted, and may in the future target, businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we expect to complete the PIPE simultaneously with the completion of the Business Combination with MoonLake, and we would expect to complete any other financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, such as the Business Combination with MoonLake, our proxy materials or tender offer documents would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, as in the case of the Business Combination with MoonLake, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with any other initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, except for the Subscription Agreements we entered into in connection with the PIPE, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.



Selection of Target Businesses



We have evaluated a number of target businesses, including MoonLake. When evaluating each prospective target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, and a review of financial and other information that made available to us.

The rules of Nasdaq require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors determined that the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake satisfied this requirement and, in connection with such determination, relied on the opinion of an independent financial advisory firm. A copy of such opinion is included as an annex to the Definitive Proxy Statement. If we do not complete the Business Combination with MoonLake and we seek an alternate business combination, our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of an alternate initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of such other initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of such other initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. If required by Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion. Unless our board of directors is unable to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination or we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity as described below, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly prepares fairness opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.



We have structured the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake so that we will obtain a controlling equity interest in MoonLake. If we do not complete the proposed Business Combination and search for an alternate initial business combination, we anticipate structuring such alternate initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. Alternately, we may structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, as we did with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a controlling interest in MoonLake. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to the proposed Business Combination will own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination. If we instead complete an alternate initial business combination in which less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. MoonLake is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we do not complete the proposed Business Combination, and instead seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or Private Placement Shares and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. See the Definitive Proxy Statement for a discussion of potential conflicts of interest in connection with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake.

Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to at least one other entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination with MoonLake or any other potential target business.



In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination with MoonLake or any other potential target business.



In evaluating MoonLake, we conducted a due diligence review of MoonLake, which included: (i) research on the industry in which MoonLake operates; (ii) meetings with MoonLake’s management team and representatives regarding MoonLake’s operations, major customers, financial prospects and other customary due diligence matters; (iii) legal and commercial review of MoonLake’s material business contracts, books and records, government regulations and filings, intellectual property and information technology; and (iv) financial due diligence and analysis of MoonLake with the assistance of our financial advisors. In evaluating any other prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We may also retain consultants with expertise relating to a prospective target business.



We have expended considerable time, and incurred considerable costs, to select and evaluate MoonLake and to structure and pursue completion of the proposed Business Combination. The time required to select and evaluate any other target business and to structure and complete any other initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. For illustrative purposes, the amount in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2021, was approximately $10.00 per Public Share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Such persons did not receive separate consideration for their waiver of redemption rights.





5






Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules



In the event we do not complete the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, and instead pursue an alternate business combination and conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.



Upon the public announcement of such alternate initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote



We will seek shareholder approval of the MoonLake business combination as discussed in more detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on February 14, 2022. If we do not complete the business combination with MoonLake and seek an alternate business combination, and we seek shareholder approval of such alternate business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, as we will in connection with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, we will complete our initial business combination only if it is approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the Company. A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of a majority of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy. Our sponsor, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 4,312,501, or 37.5%, of the 11,500,000 Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of our sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a public shareholder on the record date for the general meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, as we will in connection with the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will not make any purchases if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.





6






The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our shares may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our Class A ordinary shares may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our Class A ordinary shares on a national securities exchange.



Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval



We will seek shareholder approval of the MoonLake business combination as discussed in more detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement. If we do not complete the business combination with MoonLake and seek an alternate business combination and if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below) without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.

Competition



If we are unable to complete our business combination with MoonLake, we expect to encounter competition in identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for an alternate business combination, from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may have placed us at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating the proposed Business Combination with MoonLake, or may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an alternate initial business combination.Employees



We currently have two officers: Bihua Chen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew J. Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information



We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
