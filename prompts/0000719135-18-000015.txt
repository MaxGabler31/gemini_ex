ITEM 1. Business
General
Bovie Medical Corporation (“Company”, “Bovie Medical”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 5115 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, FL 33760.
We are an energy-based medical device company specializing in developing, manufacturing and marketing a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, as well as related medical products used in doctor’s offices, surgery centers and hospitals worldwide. Our medical devices are marketed through Bovie’s own well-respected brands (Bovie®, IDS™ and DERMTM) and on a private label basis to distributors throughout the world. The Company also leverages its expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing equipment for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy based designs.
We are also the developer of J-Plasma; a patented helium-based plasma surgical product which we believe has the potential to be a transformational product for surgeons. 
Our objective is to achieve profitable, sustainable growth by increasing our market share in the advanced energy category, including the commercialization of products that have the potential to be transformational with respect to the results they produce for surgeons and patients. In order to achieve this objective, we plan to leverage our long history in the industry, along with the reputation for quality and reliability that the Bovie brand enjoys within the medical community. At the same time, we will expand our product offerings beyond radio frequency devices, move forward with research and developments projects aimed at creating value within our existing product portfolio, build our pipeline of new complementary products, and utilize multiple channels to bring new and existing products to market.
We are working to build our position in advanced electrosurgical generators and disposables, which can be used in diversified niche markets with minimally invasive surgical instruments, while furthering our status as a pioneer in plasma technology and its various medical applications.
Significant Subsidiaries
Aaron Medical Industries, Inc. is a wholly-owned Florida corporation based in Clearwater, Florida. It is principally engaged in the business of marketing our medical products through distributors worldwide under the Bovie name.
Bovie Bulgaria, EOOD is a wholly-owned limited liability company incorporated under Bulgarian law, located in Sofia, Bulgaria. It is engaged in the business of engineering and manufacturing our electrosurgical and OEM generators and accessories.
Industry
Healthcare reform has caused consolidation among providers, with hospitals merging, physician practices joining hospitals and institutions combining to form Accountable Care Organizations, to manage patients on an interdisciplinary basis. Although the medical device industry can be challenging and very competitive, we believe it will continue to have a positive, long-term growth trajectory with the number of surgical procedures performed increasing annually as a result of the aging “baby boomer” population and other healthcare trends. Additionally, we also anticipate a continued increase in minimally invasive surgical procedures due to ongoing advancements in technology coupled with continued overall pressure to reduce healthcare costs via a reduction in patient trauma and recovery time. Markets will also continue to provide growth opportunities for the medical device industry.
We believe that Bovie Medical has sustainable, competitive advantages in the medical device market for several reasons. We have a long history in electrosurgery. Our inspiration dates back to the first use of an electrosurgical generator in an operating room in the U.S. in 1926 where Dr. William T. Bovie was present. Thus, the Bovie name is recognized by surgeons the world over for having pioneered the electrosurgery field and is recognized for its outstanding product quality supported by strong engineering and research and development capabilities. This history equates to very strong recognition of the Bovie brand. We believe that our equipment and devices have and will continue to provide better experiences for patients at a lower cost to the healthcare system.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

Our Three Business Segments
We manage our business through three reportable operating segments: Core, OEM, and Advanced Energy.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Core segment contributed 73.7% of our consolidated total revenue, our OEM segment contributed 6.7% of our consolidated total revenue and our Advanced Energy segment contributed 19.6% of our consolidated total revenue.
Core Segment
Overview
Our Core segment manufactures and markets various medical products, both under private label and the Bovie brands (Bovie, IDS and DERM), to distributors worldwide, which distribute to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other healthcare facilities. New distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and our presence at domestic and international trade shows.
Customers
We sell our Core products through major distributors which include Cardinal Health, Independent Medical Co-Op Inc. (IMCO), McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc., National Distribution and Contracting Inc. (NDC), Henry Schein, Medline, and Owens & Minor and have manufacturing agreements for private label of certain products with these and others.
Products
Core products consist of electrosurgery generators and accessories, battery-operated cauteries, lighting, nerve locators, eye-bubbles, penlights, and a variety of other products.
Electrosurgery Products
Electrosurgery is our largest product line and includes desiccators, generators, electrodes, electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products. These electrosurgical products are used during surgical procedures in gynecology, urology, plastic surgery, dermatology and other surgical markets, including veterinary, for the cutting and coagulation of tissue. It is estimated that electrosurgery is used in 80% of all surgical procedures. Our electrosurgery products fall under two categories, monopolar and bipolar. Monopolar products require the use of a grounding pad attached to the patient for the return of the electrical current, while bipolar products consist of two electrodes; one for the inbound current and one for the return current and therefore do not require the use of a grounding pad.
DERM 101 and DERM 102
These effective and economical 10 watt high frequency desiccators provide a low wattage platform for minor in-office skin procedures. We designed these products specifically for family practice physicians, pediatricians and other general practitioners, enabling them to perform simple skin procedures in their offices instead of referring the patient to a specialist saving the patient time and providing additional revenue generating procedures for the physician.
DERM A942™, Bantam|Pro A952™ and Specialist|Pro A1250S
Bovie’s line of electrosurgical generators has been recently updated with added features and to provide a more modern look for today’s physician office.
The new Bovie DERM A942 is a low powered 40-watt high frequency desiccator designed primarily for dermatology. These units are used mainly for removing skin lesions and growths as well as for coagulation in office-based procedures.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

The Bovie Bantam|Pro A952 is a 50-watt high frequency desiccator with the added feature of a cut capacity for outpatient surgical procedures. In effect, the Bovie Bantam|Pro is two independent surgical devices in one small package. The Bantam|Pro replaces the Aaron A950 but with the added feature of Bovie NEM (neutral electrode monitoring), a safety feature that reduces the potential for alternate site burns. This unit is designed mainly for use in doctors’ offices and is used in a broad range of specialties including dermatology, gynecology, family practice, urology, plastic surgery and ophthalmology.
The Bovie Specialist|Pro A1250S is a 120-watt multipurpose electrosurgery generator. The unit features monopolar and bipolar functions with pad sensing and is designed to operate like the larger operating room generator in a reduced size. This product is considered to be ideally suited for office-based procedures in the specialties of gynecology, plastic surgery and urology.
Bovie Surgi-Center|Pro A2350 - IDS210 and Bovie OR|Pro A3350 - IDS310
To address market demand for more powerful electrosurgical generators, Bovie developed 200, 300 and 400-watt multipurpose digital electrosurgery generators designed for the surgi-center market and the hospital outpatient and inpatient markets. This equipment includes digital hardware that enables very high parallel data processing throughout the operation or procedure. All data is sampled and processed digitally. For the first time in electrosurgery, generators are able to measure tissue impedance in real time (5,000 times a second) thanks to the utilization of digital technology. The design of these units is based on a digital feedback system. By using dedicated digital hardware in place of a general purpose controller for processing data, our equipment enables the power to be adjusted as the impedance varies, to deliver a consistent clinical effect.
Bovie Surgi-Center|Pro A2350 and IDS210 are 200-watt generators that have the capability to be used in the majority of procedures performed today in surgi-center or outpatient settings. Although 200 watts is adequate to do most procedures in the operating room, 300 watts is considered the standard and believed to be what most hospitals and surgi-centers will require. To meet this requirement, we developed the Bovie OR|Pro A3350 - IDS 310. The Bovie OR|Pro and IDS 310 incorporate the best features of the IDS 300 and upgrade its capabilities by providing additional bipolar options, including the 225-watt Bovie bipolar and an auto bipolar feature. The 300 watt units also offer the capability to utilize two pencils with simultaneous activation in fulguration mode. In addition, these newer models meet new standards required to sell these products in many of the global markets. The Bovie IDS 400 is a 400-watt generator designed primarily for sale in markets outside of the United States. These units feature both monopolar and bipolar functions, have pad and tissue sensing and include nine blended cutting setting.
Electrosurgical Disposables
Resistick™ II
Resistick II is a trademarked and proprietary coating that is applied to stainless steel that resist eschar (scab or scar tissue caused by burning) during surgery. We have experienced strong demand for this product since its introduction in 2011 and it represents our continued expansion of the Bovie line of electrosurgical disposables.
Disposable Laparoscopic Electrodes
We have introduced a line of disposable laparoscopic electrodes in Resistick coated and stainless steel for use by physicians from a broad group of specialties including gynecology, general surgery and urology. These electrodes are offered in J-hook, L-hook, needle, ball and spatula design and have an adapter included which makes these laparoscopic electrodes usable with a 3/32“ or 4mm plug.
Cauteries
Battery Operated Cauteries
Battery operated cauteries were originally designed for precise hemostasis (to stop bleeding) in ophthalmology. The current use of cauteries has been substantially expanded to include a broad range of applications. Battery operated cauteries are primarily sterile one-time use products. We have continued to improve our offering and in 2016, had a patent issued covering our snap design cautery. It features a switch mechanism that dramatically reduces the potential for accidental activation. We manufacture one of the broadest lines of cauteries in the world, including but not limited to, a line of replaceable battery and replaceable tip cauteries, which are popular in veterinary and overseas markets.

Other Products
Battery Operated Medical Lights
We manufacture and market a variety of specialty lighting instruments for use in ophthalmology as well as distribute specialty lighting instruments for general surgery, hip replacement surgery and for the placement of endotracheal tubes in emergency and surgical procedures. We also manufacture and market physicians’ office use penlights.
Nerve Locator Stimulator
We manufacture a nerve locator stimulator primarily used for identifying motor nerves in hand and facial reconstructive surgery. This instrument is a sterile, self-contained, battery-operated unit, for one time use.
Competition
We compete with numerous manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies and devices, many of which are large and well-established. With the exception of endoscopic instrumentation, which are sold directly or through distribution partners to the end-user under our own brand, many of our products are private labeled. The majority of the products in our core business are sold through distributors under the Bovie label. The balance is private labeled for major distributors who sell it under their own name. By having private labeled and branded distribution, we are able to increase our position in the marketplace and compete with much larger organizations. While our private label customers distribute products through their internal sales force, the majority of our products are sold through distributors which increase our sales potential and help level the playing field relative to our large competitors that sell direct. Domestically, we continue to believe that we have a substantial market share in the field of electrosurgical generator manufacturing through our Bovie branded and OEM units.
Our main competitors in electrosurgical and accessory markets are Valleylab (a division of Medtronic), Conmed and Erbe Electromedizine. In the battery-operated cautery market, our main competitor is Beaver Visitec and in the endoscopic instrumentation market, it is Ethicon (a division of Johnson and Johnson) and Covidien Surgical Solutions. 
OEM Segment
Overview
The Company leverages its expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing equipment for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy based designs. These OEM and private label arrangements and our use of the Bovie brands enable us to gain greater market share for the distribution of our products.
Advanced Energy Segment
Overview
The Advanced Energy Segment consists primarily of J-Plasma; a patented helium-based plasma surgical product which we believe has the potential to be a transformational product for surgeons. J-Plasma has US FDA clearance, CE mark, and clearance for sale in multiple other countries and is generally indicated for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The J-Plasma system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. J-Plasma has been the subject of ten white papers and has been cited therein for its clinical utility in gynecological and plastic surgery procedures.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

Our J-Plasma product initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December, 2014, which enables us to sell the product in the European Union. In 2014, we created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to J-Plasma. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for J-Plasma with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, extending and customizing the J-Plasma product line and expanding the surgical specialties in which J-Plasma can become the “standard of care“ for certain procedures.
By the end of 2017, we had 17 field-based selling professionals and a network of 14 independent manufacturing representatives, resulting in a total sales force of 31. This is a surgery based selling organization with its focus on the use of J-Plasma for surgical procedures.
From 2015 through 2017, we launched numerous new J-Plasma products in an effort to target new surgical procedures, users, and markets. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives, we have significantly increased the number of physicians using J-Plasma by expanding usage to include the surgical oncology market and the cosmetic surgery market.
In 2017 specifically, we launched an updated version of the Bovie Ultimate generator, and a new J-Plasma handpiece for open surgical procedures. The updated version of the Bovie Ultimate generator and the new handpieces allow for the combination of our trademarked Cool-Coag technology and J-Plasma into one, multiple purpose handpiece. Cool-Coag combines standard monopolar coagulation waveforms with helium to provide three distinct modes to stop bleeding including a high fulguration/spray effect. During the second quarter of 2017, we refocused our U.S. sales team into the cosmetic surgery market. Since that time, we have seen a significant increase in the number of physicians using J-Plasma in the cosmetic surgery market.
In order to assist us in leveraging J-Plasma’s precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we launched a Medical Advisory Board in 2015 which is currently comprised of surgeons who are recognized leaders in GYN, urology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery. In 2017, we added an additional surgeon to this board from the cosmetic surgical specialty.
In 2018, our J-Plasma commercial strategy in the U.S. will be primarily focused on advancing the usage of J-Plasma in the cosmetic surgery market. In our international markets, we will also focus on cosmetic surgery and will continue to focus on the surgical oncology market. Our primary international focus will be on advancing the adoption of J-Plasma in the hospital setting. We believe the majority of our targeted procedures in international markets take place in the hospital surgical suite and believe the sales process is shorter in hospitals in international markets as compared to those in the United States. Also, in 2018, we will initiate a clinical and regulatory strategy to support our market focus, once complete, we will launch a corresponding marketing campaign.
We are continuing to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology for the long term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders and this may adversely affect our short term profitability and cash flow, particularly over the next 12 to 24 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that J-Plasma will be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized.
Customers
We primarily sell our J-Plasma products through our direct sales force to physicians, surgical centers and hospitals.
Products
During 2017, Advanced Energy Products consisted of the J-Plasma line of products and the Plazxact arthroscopic bipolar ablator. The J-Plasma system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. The Plazxact arthroscopic bipolar ablator is used to ablate damaged, soft tissue in joint procedures to help improve function or reduce pain. The Plazxact system is designed with a very efficient tip design that allows the ablator to be activated with any standard electrosurgical generator. This eases and shortens the sales cycle for the product by removing the need to sell capital equipment to the hospital.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

J-Plasma Generator
In June 2017, we launched the newest version of the Bovie Ultimate™ generator. The Bovie Ultimate 2.0 is a high frequency electrosurgical generator that can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. The generator offers users monopolar, bipolar and J-Plasma features in a single generator. It also powers the Cool-Coag technology that has been incorporated into the new Precise Open and Precise FLEX J-Plasma handpieces that were released in December 2017. These 2017 new product releases continue to expand the procedure base for J-Plasma by providing the surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations and perform specific procedures.
J-Plasma Disposable Portfolio
We offer different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices have been shown to cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The two primary specialties that are targeted in phase one of the product launch are surgical oncology and cosmetic surgery. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that surgical applications are just one area of opportunity for this technology.
Competition
Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are RF based competitors, argon plasma competitors, and CO2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2017.
