Overview
 
LiveXLive Media, Inc. (the “Company,” “LXL,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a pioneer in the acquisition, distribution and monetization of live music, Internet radio and music-related streaming and video content. Through our comprehensive service offerings and innovative content platform, we provide music fans the ability to watch, listen, experience, discuss, deliberate and enjoy live music and entertainment 24/7/365. Serving a global music audience, our mission is to bring the experience of live music and entertainment to music consumers wherever music is watched, listened to, discussed, deliberated or performed around the world. We operate LiveXLive (“LiveXLive”), one of the industry’s leading live music streaming platforms; Slacker Radio, a streaming music service that we obtained through our acquisition of Slacker, Inc. (or “Slacker”) on December 29, 2017; and also produce original music-related content.  LiveXLive is the first ‘live social music network’, delivering premium live-streamed, digital audio and on-demand music experiences from the world’s top music festivals and concerts, including Rock in Rio, EDC Las Vegas, Hangout Music Festival and many more. LiveXLive also gives audiences access to premium original content, artist exclusives and industry interviews. Through March 31, 2018, we have streamed seven major music festivals of live music to over 65 million fans in over 120 countries, and our subscription services eclipsed 39 billion song listens through over one million users on Slacker. Through Slacker, our users have access to millions of songs and hundreds of expert-curated radio platforms and stations. Today, our business is comprised of a single operating segment (hereon referred to as our “music services”).
 
We generate revenue primarily through the sales of subscription-based services and advertising from our music offerings, and secondarily from the licensing of our live music content rights and services.
 
Music Services 
 
Our music services provide our music fans the ability to experience, engage in and listen to live music, digital Internet radio and music streaming services on any connected device and screen 24/7/365, including desk-top, tablets, mobile applications (iOS and Android) and automobile music play interfaces. Today, we provide our music services through dedicated over-the-top applications (“Apps”), LiveXLive and Slacker Radio. Our music services are delivered through digital streaming transmissions over the Internet and or through satellite transmissions. Our users can also access our music platform from our websites, including www.livexlive.com and www.slacker.com, and through our digital Apps.
 
We acquire the rights to stream our live and recorded music and broadcasts from a combination of festival owners, such as Anschutz Entertainment Group (“AEG”) and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (“Live Nation”), music labels, including Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music, and through individual music publishers and rights holders. Today, the vast majority of our content acquisition agreements provide us the exclusive rights to produce, license, broadcast and distribute live broadcast streams of these festivals and events throughout the world and across any digital platform, including cable, Internet, video, audio, video-on-demand (“VOD”) and virtual reality (“VR”). Our license rights to provide recorded music licenses and broadcasts principally cover North America today. Through March 31, 2018, we held the streaming rights to over 20 festivals under long-term contracts that range from three to seven years in duration. Today, we have increased these live streaming festival rights to over 27 festivals and are working to expand our VOD, content catalog and content capabilities.
 
Our music services commenced operations through LiveXLive in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, when we streamed our first music festival. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we acquired Slacker and deployed our subscription-based music services. After the Slacker acquisition, we launched our LXL App across Apple, Roku and Amazon fire platforms. In February 2018, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Insomniac Holdings LLC (“Insomniac”), a partner with Live Nation and the owner of EDC (“Electronic Daisy Carnival”) festival and other dance music festivals and events, to produce and stream up to 20 major festivals around the world and over 100 events annually across our music platform. With over 25 large festivals, approximately 450,000 paid subscriptions and 1.4 million users as of March 31, 2018, we have online one of the largest music platforms capable of streaming live and recorded music and broadcasts globally. In the near future, we also expect to deliver more unique content and music related events, including the launch of LiveZone, a 24/7/365 virtual music studio that will deliver up-to-date music news and events to our users.

Live Music Events 
 
We produce, edit, curate and stream live music events through broadband transmission over the Internet and or satellite networks to our users throughout the world, where permitted. This service allows our users to access live music content over the Internet through their personal cellular phones, desktops, computers, tablets, and televisions, including the ability to chat and communicate over our platform. Today, LiveXLive provides these live music events for free to our users. We plan to monetize these live events through third party advertising, sponsorship, and or selling territorial licensing rights, and in some cases through co-production with third parties such as MTV. Our fee structure varies by festival, and is customarily in the form of (i) a set upfront fee; (ii) a fee based on number of viewers for a particular event and timeframe; and/or (iii) flat fee per licensed territory. The fees generated from advertising, sponsored content, VOD and other services are generally subject to revenue sharing arrangements with our festival owners and music right holders, when applicable.
Digital Internet Radio and Music Services
 
Today, our digital Slacker Internet radio and music services are available to users online and through original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) on a white label basis, which allow certain OEMs to customize the radio and music services with their own logos, branding and systems. Our users are able to listen to a variety of music, radio personalities, news, sports and the audio of live music events. Our fee structure for our digital Internet radio and music services varies, and may be in the form of (i) a free service to the listener supported by paid advertising, (ii) paid premium subscription services, and or (iii) a fixed fee per user. The fees generated from ad-supported and subscription services are generally subject to revenue sharing arrangements with music right holders and labels, and fees to third-party Content Providers.
Ancillary Products and Services
 
We also provide our customers the following:
 

● | Regulatory Support – streaming of music is generally subject to copyright protection. Whenever possible, we use our best efforts to clear music copyright licenses, artist streaming preferences and music publishing rights in advance of usage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post-Implementation Support - once our Apps are live, we provide technical and network support, which includes 24/7 operational assistance and monitoring of our services and performance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Industry
 
Our addressable market includes streaming of live music and entertainment, Internet radio, audio and downloadable music and online VOD services. These three markets are experiencing significant growth and now represent the majority of the music industry’s overall revenue, as physical and digital record sales have steadily declined. We both capitalize on these trends and provide additional earnings opportunities to industry stakeholders, including agents, managers, distributors, producers, labels, publishers, advertisers and social influencers (collectively, “Industry Stakeholders”).

Live Music Industry
 
The live music industry is a large, growing market that creates, manages and promotes live performances and events, ranging from festivals to concerts and events in stadiums, arenas, and other smaller venues. In the U.S. alone, the live music industry is expected to have generated over $29.0 billion of revenue annually by 2020, representing a +1% growth rate over 2016 (IBIS World) and over $5.0 billion in live music sponsorship for the same periods. Live events and festivals have become an increasingly important cultural phenomenon as seen by more than 2,000 music festivals worldwide. Each festival can attract hundreds of thousands of people with attendance at the largest festival in the United States estimated at over 140,000 people per day. Rock in Rio, for instance, attracted a combined attendance of over 1,000,000 people in 2015 and 2016 in Lisbon and Rio. The most popular festivals based on attendance include Coachella, EDC, Glastonbury, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, Rock Werchter, Rock in Rio, Roskilde, Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival. The live event industry is a global market with only a fraction of the leading live music events located in the U.S. In addition to festivals, there are thousands of live music events and performances that occur nightly in large and small venues such as arenas, theatres, clubs, bars and lounges.
 
As a result of the popularity of live music performances, there has been a growing interest in experiencing live events and performances via online streaming distribution. For example, in 2018, over 14 million people viewed our weekend stream of three major festivals (EDC Las Vegas, Hangout Music Festival and Rock on the Range).
 
Additionally, the growth of the live music industry benefits ancillary verticals, such as merchandise and primary/secondary ticket marketplaces. Merchandise includes the retail sales of licensed music-related goods and is estimated to be larger than $2 billion since 2014.
 
Digital Music Streaming Industry
 
The addressable market for paid digital music streaming is large and growing and has surpassed physical music sales. The digital music streaming industry generated approximately $5.4 billion of revenue in 2016, and is expected to surpass $11.0 billion in 2020, representing a 20% CAGR over 2016 (IBISWorld; PwC Global Entertainment and Media Outlook).
 
These same fans are increasingly engaging digitally on their mobile devices. With over 2.5 billion smartphone users globally in 2018, we expect that mobile will continue to represent a significant opportunity for streaming live music and music-related content. More than 60% of Internet users globally listened to music through direct download or live stream from services such as Apple Music and iTunes, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer and Spotify (eMarketer, August 2016).
 
We believe that the demand for live music and music-related content that is optimized for Internet-connected devices will continue to grow with the further development of mobile devices and increases in mobile carrier bandwidth. We intend to continue to extend our global reach by executing deals with new partners and strengthening our business model to enable us to further monetize the content offered on our network across these devices.
 
Online Video Streaming Industry
 
The addressable market for online video streaming is large and growing. The online video streaming industry is expected to generate $30.3 billing in revenue by 2020, up from approximately $19.6 billion of revenue in 2016, representing an 11.5% CAGR over 2016 (IBIS World, PwC Global Entertainment and Media Outlook).
 
Additionally, an important subset of the growing online video streaming market is live video streaming. According to Facebook Live, users watch live video three times longer and comment ten times more than recorded footage (Eventbrite Blog, August 22, 2016). We aim to capitalize on what we believe is an increasing trend in user engagement with live video content.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we do not currently have a trademark on the LiveXLive name, on September 23, 2017, we entered into a Co-Existence Agreement with Monday Sessions Media, Inc. D/B/A Live X (“Live X”), in which we consented to Live X’s use and registration of the name and mark Live X and agreed to not challenge, dispute or contest Live X’s rights in such mark. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to not offer certain production services to third party businesses in connection with our mark LIVEXLIVE and use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Live X opportunities to bid on production or streaming service opportunities. We intend to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, patents and other original and acquired works, ancillary goods and services. In connection with the Slacker acquisition, we acquired a trademark for the Slacker name. We believe that certain trademarks and other proprietary rights that we may apply for or otherwise obtain will have significant value and will be important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be successful or adequate to prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violation of these rights. Upon the consummation of any future acquisitions, we may acquire additional registered trademarks, as well as applied-for trademarks potentially for worldwide use.
 
Streaming Internet Radio
 
We continuously obtains high-quality digital content and associated data from the record labels. These master files are stored in a secure database and transcoded into various audio formats that are then pushed to our production environment. The production system supports numerous streaming formats as required to serve the numerous end-user consumption devices that our service supports, including mobile handsets, connected car audio systems, smart TVs, HTML web players, etc. The production infrastructure consists of servers housed in our data center and caching servers, managed by our partners, distributed across the internet. The caching servers temporarily store the content and related formats that are in high demand, thereby placing the most popular content closest to user endpoints, reducing latency and the number of content requests sent to our data center. When a given user makes a play request from their mobile device, the web, connected car, etc., the system sets up a secure connection to that user’s device, automatically detects the proper format and the highest quality bitrate that can be streamed, and delivers the stream to our users.
Live Music 
 
Technology is a key component of the LiveXLive network that brings our ecosystem to life for our users and festivals, clubs, events, concerts, artists, promoters, venues, music labels and publishers (“Content Providers”). We currently deliver our viewer experience through an HTML-based website compatible with most major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g., Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android). Our developers bring extensive experience building technology solutions for the leading media companies of the world, including the design of live and VOD workflows, the video content management system and delivery of content on mobile, OTT and desktop clients.
 
More recently, we built and launched a pioneering technology stack for delivering our content to users on nearly any internet-connected device. As of May 2018, our updated version of the LXL App was available on the iOS and Android operating systems and through Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire platforms. We are also continuing to finalize our OTT strategy, which to date has resulted in the release of our custom OTT application the aforementioned platforms and will be ultimately be available on most OTT platforms and consoles. We believe our full-service, delivery-to-distribution back-end will allow us to capitalize on monetization opportunities and is the first step in creating a digital supply chain for live music and music-related video content.
 
In April 2018, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to create interactive streaming experiences around live music events which will be streamed on the LiveXLive website and our LXL App. The interactive streaming develops engagement and analytics software and offers a platform that enables a new category of live experiences that facilitates two-way interactions between streamers and their audiences. The overall platform also enables enterprise live streamers to engage their audiences and gather data insights which will help us analyze how we can increase user retention and develop and increase our monetization opportunities.

Users
 
We currently stream our music services for live events globally to music fans worldwide, and with users located in North America for our digital Internet radio services. We are currently developing plans to expand our digital Internet radio presence internationally. Our music streaming customers include individual users and OEMs such as Tesla, Verizon, T-Mobile, and, to a lesser extent, advertisers and third-party licensees. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we had one single customer that represented approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenue in the period.
 
We provide live production and content curating and processing services to our festival and event partners on an exclusive basis, globally. These agreements are generally for three to seven years in duration. Our customers also include major cable networks such as MTV, where we have historically agreed to share production costs for certain festivals. As of March 31, 2018, we were the exclusive representative to over 25 festivals around the world.
 
Competitive Advantage
 
We are producers, acquirers and distributors of live and digital music and Internet radio entertainment services, and work closely with major and independent labels, music festival owners and other content producers to provide unique and compelling music content across our platform for our listeners. Accordingly, our significant operating and deal-making experience and relationships with Content Providers, OEMs such as Tesla, cable networks such as MTV, major advertisers and music publishers and distribution companies in our industry gives us a number of competitive advantages and may present us with a substantial number of additional business targets and relationships to facilitate growth going forward. We believe that we have sustainable competitive advantages due to our growing market position in live events, technology and relationships with important music labels, content suppliers and festival owners.
 
Our leadership team, consisting of our senior and executive management and our board of directors, collectively brings a wealth of industry relationships and expertise in the fields of programming, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution, web, digital, linear, mobile, legal and finance. The members of our advisory board are renowned in their respective fields, are considered thought leaders in the entertainment industry by their peers, further enhance our credibility and provide strategic guidance to our management team.
 
Many of the members of our leadership team have built businesses as entrepreneurs and/or have been executives at Fortune 500 companies. The team includes seasoned Wall Street executives that have collectively been extensively involved in mergers and acquisitions of in the live event, recorded music, music publishing, fashion, technology and other media and entertainment businesses. Our leadership team provides the knowledge to source, analyze, negotiate and complete acquisition transactions, partnerships and other business combinations.
 
Strategy
 
Content
 
As of March 31, 2018, we streamed 7 major music festivals. As of today, we are contracted to stream over 27 live performance festivals. The majority of our festival agreements provide us multi-year, exclusive rights to produce and digitally stream these live festivals across any screen in most major territories around the world for periods between three to seven years. Moreover, and in most cases, we also have the exclusive rights to VOD, VR and audio rights from these festivals (subject to music copyright clearances). We believe there is substantial value in producing and streaming live events. Our near-term strategy is to continue aggressively acquiring and aggregating live and on-demand performances (e.g., on stage sets) and non-performance (e.g., behind the scenes, interviews) music-related video content from festivals, clubs, events, concerts, artists, promoters, venues, music labels and publishers (collectively, the “Content Providers”); acquiring and producing original music-related video and audio content; and curating existing online and digital radio premium content. In addition to acquiring and/or partnering with third party Content Providers, our digital studio, LXL Studios, plans to develop and produce original music-related video content, including digital magazine-style news programming and original-concept digital pilots and documentaries.
 
Our near-term strategy is to continue aggressively acquiring and aggregating live and on-demand performances (e.g., on stage sets) and non-performance (e.g., behind the scenes, interviews) music-related video content from the Content Providers; acquiring and producing original music-related video and audio content; and curating existing online and digital radio premium content. In addition to acquiring and/or partnering with third party Content Providers, our digital studio, LXL Studios, plans to develop and produce original music-related video content, including digital magazine-style news programming and original-concept digital pilots and documentaries. With approximately 2,000 festival-like live events in the world today, we also believe there is enough live music content to acquire and fill our programming 24/7/365.
 
Over the long term, our strategy is to combine our live events with our audio music and radio services (collectively, the “Music Services”). We believe that the combination of these Music Services will serve as our user engagement platform, differentiate our Music Services from our competitors and provide us more opportunities to expand and grow our current user base and revenues from subscription fees, advertising, sponsorship and licensing. Moreover, we plan to drive more audience to our Music Services platform of as we grow our streamed live events, helping us leverage and lower our overall marketing spending and drive more user growth.

Advertising and Long-Term Revenue Opportunities
 
During the year ended March 31, 2018, approximately 10% of our revenue was from advertising, and the remainder was from subscription revenue from our Slacker platform. Our near-term strategy is to increase the overall percentage mix of advertising versus subscription revenue. Beginning in the second half of our year ending March 31, 2019, we plan to launch our advertising services across our live events LiveXLive streaming services for the first time. Over the long-term, our plan is to continue to grow our advertising capabilities across our entire Music Services platform. Part of our long-term strategy also includes immersing our fans into the live music experience digitally. As a result, we also plan to introduce other revenue lines of services customarily available at live events including event ticket sales and music merchandise sales. We also believe the data we generate from our platform will be valuable to Industry Stakeholders.
 
Platform Innovation
 
Our platform engagement strategy is to build a compelling online experience for our users, anchored by a pioneering website and our custom LXL App. The LiveXLive platform offers access to some of the world’s leading music festivals and events with multi-day and simultaneous multi-stage coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and premium programming. It is fueled by our LXL App, which we believe will drive 24/7/365 user engagement and data that we will be able to convert to earnings and cash flow through multiple potential revenue streams.
 
We are designing our custom LXL App with interactive features that will enhance the live music experience and, when combined with our platform’s functionality and unique features, will create an immersive digital experience in and of itself. We believe the combination of the intuitive, modern LiveXLive user interface and cross-platform capabilities will be instrumental in creating a deeply engaging, personally-tailored central hub for live music and music-related video content, particularly for those users who are otherwise unable to attend live events in person. Our aim is to also include options for artist fan club membership, merchandise, ticketing, VIP packages and other offerings to further solidify users’ affinity toward our platform and their interests.
 
The centerpiece of our online experience will be the “Digital Venue” in which video feeds, chat, real time user interface elements and community interaction come together in a single unique online environment. Our influencers and on-air talent will be able to interact with the audience and artists alike through the venue. This multi-screen experience will be unique and superior to many existing tools.
 


LiveXLive currently runs on a responsive HTML-based website that has been developed to work across browsers on nearly any Internet-connected screen. The website’s landing page includes a featured content window used for the most relevant content. The remainder of the page features video content that is updated regularly and covers a full spectrum of music genres. As our content library and user data grows, this featured content window and other aspects of the user experience will be individually tailored to a user’s preferences and interests. We intend to add video, display and other advertising to the website to generate additional revenue. We will work with our developers to continue to add and tweak features based on internal and external feedback.
 
The LXL App ecosphere will include live video streaming, VOD, push notifications, festival-, venue- and original content-specific functionality, locally sold and programmatic ads capability, digital rights management, geo-blocking), the capability to display time-shifted content and enhanced functionality that will support social media sharing and user community. The main landing page of the LXL App will include a graphic depicting a featured performance at the top of the screen and options for viewing concurrent programming located below the graphic. The LXL App will also include a “Festivals” tab dedicated to ongoing and past festivals. We plan for this tab to allow users to view multiple stages of a single festival broadcasting live simultaneously. We believe this fun and simple interface layout, together with LiveZone, will highlight key content and encourage users to also discover our other content offerings.

-

 

In addition to the standard features, the LXL App will showcase several features that we believe will encourage and facilitate user engagement and interactivity, including:
 
LiveX-It — The feature allows users to compile select artist performance clips and share them across any chosen outlet in the form of a live performance “mixtape.”
 


Chat — In our endeavor to enhance the live event experience digitally, we will feature an integrated user chat system so users can connect, share and comment regarding the live content. The integrated chat will allow users to connect, comment and share, all without leaving the LXL App.
 


Crowdsurfing — Modeled after location-based meet-up apps, the LXL App will have crowdsurfing capability to allow users to find and meet up at live events and connect with digital viewers. We want to take the integrated chat and bring it to the real world.
 
Community Features — Central to the consumption of live music online is the ability for the audience to interact with each other, our hosts and influencers, and the artists themselves.

Facebook Live and Periscope have already shown the demand exists for users to interact with video content while it is being streamed.
 


Livestarter — Users will be able to participate in by crowdfunding special music events and experiences for social causes and charitable purpose featuring artists and performers of the user’s choice. In addition to enjoying the resulting performance, users will receive an “event producer credit” memorializing the user’s role in the production of the event.
 


Personalization — Through our acquisition of Slacker we are able to add their highly developed enterprise content and user management systems to the LiveXLive platform. Once they have been upgraded to work with video as well as audio, they will form the core of LiveXLive’s data management platform and personalization system.
 
Slacker’s expertise and toolset for generating both human curated and programmatically generated media channels allows LiveXLive to quickly bring both audio and video channels to market for a fraction of the expense typically associated with those activities.
 
By executing the above strategies, we are creating a platform that is dedicated to live music and has the breadth and depth of content to reach and be relevant to a global audience of all ages.

Market Leader – Live Music Events and Content
 
We believe there is significant unmet demand for experiencing live music, musical performance video on demand and related content online. To become a centralized hub for live music and music-related video content, we plan to execute the following interconnected components of our business: Content Aggregation, Technology Development, Marketing and Distribution, Platform Engagement and Data Collection:
Competition
 
While the broader market for live entertainment remains highly competitive, the digital distribution of live and music-related video content is still a nascent market. We believe live streamed music video content is the only remaining media genre without a dominant brand. We believe there is a tremendous amount of high quality live music content available to be captured and produced but without a singular home for distribution and access by the public at large.
 
We expect to compete for the time and attention of our users with other Content Providers based on a number of factors, including: quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and diversity of content, ease of use, price, accessibility, perceptions of advertisement load, brand awareness and reputation. We also expect to compete for the time and attention of users based on the presence and/or visibility of the LiveXLive platform as compared with other platforms and Content Providers that deliver content through Internet-connected screens.
 
Our competitors includes (i) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers such as IHeart and CBS and satellite radio providers such as Sirius XM, (ii) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as Apple’s iTunes Music Store and Apple Music, Rhapsody, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Amazon Prime that allow listeners to stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase, (iii) other forms of entertainment, including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter (including Periscope), and Yahoo, which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content, and (iv) promoters and producers of content on mobile, online and AR/VR platforms such as Redbull TV, Live Nation TV and independent content owners. To the extent that existing or potential users choose to watch satellite or cable television, streaming video from on demand services such as Hulu, VEVO or YouTube, or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than use the LiveXLive service, these content services pose a competitive threat.
 
We may also face direct competition from other large live music event competitors with regards to online distribution of live music and music-related video content, ticketing and sponsorship opportunities, including from Live Nation, AEG, and Livestyle (formerly SFX). Furthermore, there are many smaller, regional companies that compete in the market as well.
 
Music Copyright and Rights Regulation
 
As a participant in the global music and radio industries, we are subject to a variety of copyright and regulatory obligations.
 

● | Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”) – BMI is a bridge between songwriters and the business and organizations that want to play their music publicly. BMI supports businesses and organizations that play music publicly by offering blanket music licenses that permit them to play nearly 13 million musical works.

Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, both domestically and internationally, governing matters such as:
 

● | labor and employment laws; 
--+-------------------------------


● | the United States Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (the “FCPA”) and similar regulations and laws in other countries; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes; 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) requirements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | marketing activities online; and 
--+-------------------------------------


● | United States copyright laws. 
--+----------------------------------

 
We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws. We are also required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and anti-bribery regulations under the FCPA. Such regulations make it illegal for us to pay, promise to pay, or receive money or anything of value to, or from, any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute.
 
From time to time, governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at such events, particularly incidents relating to drugs and alcohol. More recently, some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods and mandate ticket inventory disclosure.
 
Privacy Policy
 
As a company conducting business on the Internet, we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to information security, data protection and privacy, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could hurt our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of personally identifiable information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their personally identifiable information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We are also subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy of listener data. Our privacy policy and terms of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of listener information and are posted on our website. Any failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy or security of our users’ information could result in a loss of confidence in our brand among existing and potential users, and ultimately, in a loss of users and advertising users, which could adversely affect our business.
 
We will also collect and use certain types of information from our users in accordance with the privacy policies posted on our websites. We will collect personally identifiable information directly from our platform’s users when they register to use our service, fill out their listener profiles, post comments, use our service’s social networking features, participate in polls and contests and sign up to receive email newsletters. We may also obtain information about our platform’s users from other platform users and third parties. We also collect information from users using our other websites in order to provide ticketing services and other user support. Our policy is to use the collected information to customize and personalize our offerings for platform users and other users and to enhance the listeners’ experience when using our service.
 
The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal, state and international laws. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to attract users from all over the world, and as we expand into new jurisdictions, the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases. It is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes, which will increase operational cost and risk. We intend to commit capital resources to ensure our compliance with any such regulations.

Intellectual Property
 
While we do not currently have a trademark on the LiveXLive name, on September 23, 2017, we entered into a Co-Existence Agreement with Monday Sessions Media, Inc. D/B/A Live X (“Live X”), in which we consented to Live X’s use and registration of the name and mark Live X and agreed to not challenge, dispute or contest Live X’s rights in such mark. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to not offer certain production services to third party businesses in connection with our mark LIVEXLIVE and use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Live X opportunities to bid on production or streaming service opportunities. We intend to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, patents and other original and acquired works, ancillary goods and services. In connection with the Slacker acquisition, we acquired a trademark for the Slacker name. We believe that certain trademarks and other proprietary rights that we may apply for or otherwise obtain will have significant value and will be important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be successful or adequate to prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violation of these rights. Upon the consummation of any future acquisitions, we may acquire additional registered trademarks, as well as applied-for trademarks potentially for worldwide use. See section below entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.”

As of March 31, 2018, we had 65 full-time employees, including through our subsidiaries. All of our employees are located in the United States.
