Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Organovo Holdings, Inc. (“Organovo Holdings,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “our Company”) is an early-stage biotechnology company that focuses on building high fidelity, 3D tissues that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. We use these models to identify gene targets responsible for driving the disease and intend to initiate drug discovery programs around these validated targets. We are initially focusing on the intestine and have ongoing 3D tissue development efforts in ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”). We intend to add additional tissues/diseases/targets to our portfolio over time. In line with these plans, we are building upon both our external and in-house scientific expertise, which will be essential to our drug development effort. 
 We use our proprietary technology to build functional 3D human tissues that mimic key aspects of native human tissue composition, architecture, function and disease. Our advances include cell type-specific compartments, prevalent intercellular tight junctions, and the formation of microvascular structures. We believe these attributes can enable critical complex, multicellular disease models that can be used to develop clinically effective drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.
 Our NovoGen Bioprinters® are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform as well as complementary 3D technologies will allow us to develop an understanding of disease biology that leads to validated novel drug targets and therapeutics to those targets to treat disease. 
 The majority of our current focus is on inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), including CD and UC.  We are creating high fidelity disease models, leveraging our prior work including the work found in our peer-reviewed publication on bioprinted intestinal tissues (Madden et al. Bioprinted 3D Primary Human Intestinal Tissues Model Aspects of Native Physiology and ADME/Tox Functions. iScience. 2018 Apr 27;2:156-167. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2018.03.015.)  Our current understanding of intestinal tissue models and IBD disease models leads us to believe that we can create models that provide greater insight into the biology of these diseases than are generally currently available.  Using these disease models, we intend to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets.  After finding therapeutic drug targets, we will focus on developing novel small molecule, antibody, or other therapeutic drug candidates to treat the disease, and advance these drug candidates towards an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing and potential future clinical trials. We may also form partnerships around the development of targets or therapeutics for the treatment of IBD.  
 We expect to broaden our work into additional therapeutic areas over time and are currently exploring specific tissues for development.  In our work to identify the areas of interest, we evaluate areas that might be better served with 3D disease models than currently available models as well as the commercial opportunity.
 We hold a large and diverse patent portfolio related to our bioprinting platform and complementary 3D technologies. The strength of this patent portfolio, the fact that it was created early in the bioprinting revolution and growth in the bioprinting industry have made for an attractive business opportunity for us. We are now beginning to invest resources to explore and expand business and revenue opportunities from the leveraging of our patent portfolio.
 Our Platform Technology 
 Our 3D human tissue platform is multifaceted. We approach each tissue agnostic to specific technologies, and intend to apply the best 3D technology to a given disease. We are developing novel disease models using high throughput systems, bioprinted and flow/stretch capable 3D systems as appropriate. Our proprietary NovoGen Bioprinters® and related technologies for preparing bio-inks and bioprinting multicellular tissues with complex architecture are grounded in over a decade of peer-reviewed scientific publications, deriving originally from research led by Dr. Gabor Forgacs, one of our founders and a former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biological Physics at the University of Missouri-Columbia (“MU”). We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property rights covering the principles, enabling instrumentation, applications, tissue constructs and methods of cell-based printing, including exclusive licenses to certain patented and patent pending technologies from MU and Clemson University. We own or exclusively license more than 160 patents and pending applications worldwide covering specific tissue designs, uses, and methods of manufacture.
The NovoGen Bioprinter® Platform 
 Our NovoGen Bioprinters® are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. A custom graphic user interface (“GUI”) facilitates the 3D design and execution of scripts that direct precision movement of multiple dispensing heads to deposit defined cellular building blocks called bio-ink. Bio-ink can be formulated as a 100% cellular composition or as a mixture of cells and other matter (hydrogels, particles). Our NovoGen Bioprinters® can also dispense pure hydrogel formulations, provided the physical properties of the hydrogel are compatible with the dispensing parameters. Most typically, hydrogels are deployed to create void spaces within specific locations in a 3D tissue or to aid in the deposition of specific cell types. We are able to employ a wide variety of proprietary cell- and hydrogel-based bio-inks in the fabrication of tissues. Our NovoGen

Bioprinters® also serve as important components of our tissue prototyping and manufacturing platform, as they are able to rapidly and precisely fabricate intricate small-scale tissue models for in vitro use as well as larger-scale tissues suitable for in vivo use. 
 Generation of bio-ink comprising human cells is the first step in our standard bioprinting. A wide variety of cells and cell-laden hydrogels can be formulated into bio-ink and bioprinted tissues, including cell lines, primary cells, and stem/progenitor cells. The majority of tissue designs employ two or more distinct varieties of bio-ink, usually comprised of cells that represent distinct compartments within a target tissue. For example, a 3D liver tissue might consist of two to three distinct bio-inks that are each made from a single cell type, a combination of cell types, and/or a combination of primary cells and one or more bio-inert hydrogels that serve as physical supports for the bioprinted tissue during its maturation period, or to transiently occupy negative spaces in a tissue design. 
 Research Collaborations 
 We continue to collaborate with several academic institutions by providing them with access to our NovoGen Bioprinters® for research purposes, including: Yale School of Medicine, Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, and the University of Virginia. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform by major research institutions may help to advance the capabilities of the platform and generate new applications for bioprinted tissues. In prior instances, an academic institution or other third party provided funding to support the academic collaborator’s access to our technology platform. This funding was typically reflected as collaboration revenues in our financial statements. Our academic research collaborations typically involve both parties contributing resources directly to projects. We are not currently generating any revenues from these collaborations.
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidential know-how, copyrights and a variety of contractual mechanisms such as confidentiality, material transfer, licenses, research collaboration, limited technology access, and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio for our core technology was initially built through licenses from MU and the Medical University of South Carolina. We subsequently expanded our intellectual property portfolio by filing our own patent and trademark applications worldwide and negotiating additional licenses and purchases.
 We recently completed a review and analysis of our full intellectual property portfolio to align it with our current business needs, strategies and objectives.  Based on that review, a number of patents and patent applications in various countries were abandoned or allowed to lapse.  The numbers provided herein are reflective of those changes.
 We solely own or hold exclusive licenses to 26 issued U.S. patents and more than 95 issued international patents in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland. We solely or jointly own or hold exclusive licenses to 23 pending U.S. patent applications and more than 20 pending international applications in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Japan and South Korea. These patent families relate to our bioprinting technology and our engineered tissue products and services, including our various uses in areas of tissue creation, in vitro testing, utilization in drug discovery, and in vivo therapeutics.
 In-Licensed Intellectual Property
 In 2009 and 2010, we obtained world-wide exclusive licenses to intellectual property owned by MU and the Medical University of South Carolina, which now includes 7 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. applications and 16 issued international patents. Dr. Gabor Forgacs, one of our founders and a former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biophysics at MU, was one of the co-inventors of all of these works (collectively, the “Forgacs Intellectual Property”). The Forgacs Intellectual Property provides us with intellectual property rights relating to cellular aggregates, the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissues, and the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissue with no scaffold present. The intellectual property rights derived from the Forgacs Intellectual Property also enables us to utilize our NovoGen Bioprinter® to create engineered tissues. 
 In 2011, we obtained an exclusive license to a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,051,654) owned by the Clemson University Research Foundation that provides us with intellectual property rights relating to methods of using ink-jet printer technology to dispense cells and relating to the creation of matrices of bioprinted cells on gel materials. 
 The patent rights we obtained through these exclusive licenses are not only foundational within the field of 3D bioprinting but provide us with favorable priority dates. We are required to make ongoing royalty payments under these exclusive licenses based on net sales of products and services that rely on the intellectual property we in-licensed. For additional information regarding our royalty obligations see “Note 4. Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

 COVID-19
 Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty. 
 The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the rise of vaccine-resistant variants, the duration of the outbreak, and any travel bans, restrictions or other limitations that may be imposed in the future. In particular, the continued COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact various aspects of our operations, including among others, our ability to raise additional capital, the timing and ability to pursue our strategy, given the impact the pandemic may have on the manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations of potential strategic partners, and the ability to advance our research and development activities and pursue development of our pipeline products, each of which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. Our employees and consultants have recently returned to working at our office and lab when necessary. We have developed guidelines and protocols to handle exposures and infections intended to keep disruptions to operations to a minimum.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of June 1, 2022, we had 18 employees, of which 9 are full-time. We have also retained some of our former employees as consultants, in addition to a number of expert consultants in specific scientific and operational areas. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards.
