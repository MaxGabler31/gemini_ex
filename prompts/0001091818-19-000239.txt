Item 1. | BUSINESS

 References in this Form 10-K to Predictive, we, us, or the Company refer to Predictive Technology Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires or is otherwise expressly stated, its subsidiaries.
 
GENERAL
 
Predictive (the Company) was formed in 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. We are a life sciences company and a leader in the use of data analytics for disease identification and subsequent therapeutic intervention through precision biopharmaceutical solutions. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Predictive Biotech, Inc., Cellsure, L3C, Predictive Laboratories, Inc., Predictive Therapeutics, Inc., and our equity method investment in Juneau Biosciences, LLC, we focus on three main clinical categories: Endometriosis, Degenerative Disc Disease and Regenerative Human Cell and Tissue Products (HCT/P). In addition to our efforts to advance regenerative medicine, we are committed to assisting women in overcoming the devastating consequences of endometriosis via appropriate early-stage diagnosis and subsequent treatment.
PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
 
The products we currently offer are various regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps for use in regenerative medicine applications. In addition, we are preparing to offer a genetic diagnostic and prognostic test that will be marketed to women that are having trouble conceiving. We are currently offering the first genetic test through a limited number of Advanced Reproductive Technologies ("ART") clinics with groups whom we believe are key opinion leaders in the field. Substantially all of our historical sales relate to our HCT/P products. 
 Reproductive Health Market
 
Our FertilityDX test is a state-of-the-art genetic testing service for couples experiencing infertility. The test utilizes a portfolio of robust genomic testing technologies to uncover genetic factors for providers in ART clinics to help navigate conception, pregnancy, and delivery. For conception, the test is expected to give insights into the best course of care related to ART, such as donor egg or sperm, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or GnRH suppression. For pregnancy and delivery, the testing will provide insights into genetic causes of pregnancy complications, which will provide ob-gyns with the knowledge of which patients may be higher risk for complications and need increased surveillance or preventative therapy. The test will also inform physicians and patients if they are at a higher risk to pass on a genetic disorder to their child and will inform embryo and/or prenatal testing.
 
FertilityDX will be launched to selected collaborators in October 2019 at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference. We will be processing FertilityDX in our CAP/CLIA approved laboratory in Salt Lake City, UT.

Endometriosis Diagnostic 
 
Our ARTguide™ test is a proprietary genetic test for women experiencing infertility as a result of endometriosis and other genetic conditions. The test is expected to give additional insights into the best course of care related to ART, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or GnRH suppression that are used to assist couples having fertility issues. ARTguide™ test results are anticipated to enable clinicians to: (1) identify if endometriosis is a potential factor causing or contributing to infertility; (2) efficiently optimize treatment plan selection for patients; (3) reduce unnecessary laparoscopies, but allow for treatment of active endometriosis; (4) minimize out-of-pocket expenses; and (5) improve live birth rates. For the patient, ARTguide™ will assist with the identification of undetected endometriosis, the avoidance of multiple failed cycles, and provide an individualized plan to achieve higher rates of pregnancy. Over 30,000 DNA samples and medical records have been collected as part of the development and validation of ARTguide™. 
 
ARTguide was launched to selected collaborators in Fall 2018. We are currently processing ARTguide™ in a CAP/CLIA approved laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
 
Endometriosis affects an estimated one in ten women of reproductive age. See, for example, [Macer, et. al, “Endometriosis and Infertility: a review of the pathogenesis and treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility Obstet Gynecol Clin  Dec. 2012] Endometriosis occurs when the tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (womb) is found in other parts of the body, most commonly in the pelvis. Monthly bleeding and inflammation caused by these lesions may severely impact a woman's quality of life. Some affected women experience severe pain, infertility, and menstrual difficulties, while some have no symptoms at all. Today, definitive diagnosis requires surgery. Due to the difficulty, invasiveness, and expense of diagnosing the condition, the majority of women diagnosed with endometriosis suffer for over a decade before receiving treatment. Treatment may involve hormonal suppression or a targeted destruction of the abnormal tissue during surgery.
 
Our ARTguide™ test was developed by Juneau Biosciences, LLC. We currently own 48.4% percent of Juneau. We have an exclusive license with Juneau to market Juneau’s patented molecular diagnostics for use in the prognosis and monitoring of endometriosis in the infertility and pelvic pain markets.
 
ARTguide™ Exclusive License
 
In 2015 we entered into an exclusive license agreement for the commercialization of the ARTguide™ test and related services for the prognosis and monitoring of endometriosis. The license agreement was amended and restated in March 2018. Under the license, as amended, (i) upon the commercial sale of the rights to the ARTguide™ or a license thereof we are required to issue to Juneau common stock with a market value of $2,500,000, (ii) we split net profits earned from the ARTguide™ evenly between Predictive and Juneau, (iii) we must have minimum sales of $12.5 million in the twelve month period beginning nine months after commercial launch, (iv) during the second year following launch we must have minimum sales of $30 million, and (v) during the third year following launch and each year thereafter we must have minimum annual sales of $60 million. If we fail to meet these metrics the license is null and void unless Predictive (a) presents written plan to Juneau describing how Predictive will use reasonable commercial efforts to improve sales and (b) Predictive agrees to spend an amount equal to the difference between the projected minimum sales and actual sales on an enhanced sales and marketing effort over the next year. 
Regenerative Medicine Products
 
We founded our life sciences business in 2015. We are a leader in regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps. A growing national network of clinics, health systems, researchers and physicians leverage our placental-derived and Whartons Jelly umbilical cord-derived products. Regenerative medicine plays an important role in the medical community and care continuum. By using regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps to create an optimal internal healing environment, it gives health care professionals new options that were not available just a few years ago.

In the emerging field of regenerative medicine, we are focused on tissue processing protocol. The power of our products is in their functionality, but just like all harvested tissue, that functionality can diminish if the tissue is not properly handled. This is why we process all of our products in our Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registered cGMP/cCTP lab utilizing proprietary methods that reduce the loss of important scaffolding proteins, growth factors, cytokines and other properties. In our ISO Class 7 clean room, we cryogenically freeze the products to better preserve viability. Our products are derived from two tissue sources -- the Whartons Jelly layer of the umbilical cord, as well as placental tissue. Our products are uniquely able to help protect, cushion and support injured parts of the body, as well as aid the optimal regenerative environment. Our products are ethically sourced from donated birthing tissues, such as umbilical cords and placentas from full-term deliveries. Comprehensive medical and social histories of the donor are obtained and tissues are procured, processed, and tested to meet standards established by FDA. Through rigorous research, we have identified the Whartons jelly layer of the umbilical cord and placental tissues to be the richest sources of regenerative properties. It is from these two sources that we derive our products, each containing a unique blend of cytokines, proteins, growth factors and scaffolding proteins, which are the functional factors involved in the reconstruction, repair, and protection of human tissue. 
 
Our four main products include AmnioCyteTM, AmnioCyte PlusTM, PolyCyteTM, and CoreCyteTM. AmnioCyteTM and AmnioCyte Plus™ are derived from amniotic fluid. PolyCyteTM is derived from the Wharton’s Jelly of the umbilical cord. CoreCyteTM is a minimally manipulated human tissue allograft derived from the Wharton’s Jelly of the umbilical cord. CoreCyteTM is processed to preserve the structural integrity of Whartons jelly for homologous use and cryogenically preserved.
 
Virtually all the revenues earned to date are derived from the sales of Regenerative Medicine Products/HCT/Ps. The percentage of revenues from each product for July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 are broken out in the table below:
 
For period July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 Percent of total revenue by product type
CoreCyte™ | 73.14%
PolyCyte™ | 11.05%
AmnioCyte+™ | 6.40% 
AmnioCyte™ | 4.16% 
Wharton’s Jelly | 5.25% 
Total | 100%

PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT
 
Background - Molecular Diagnostics
 
We believe that advances in the emerging field of molecular diagnostics will improve our ability to determine which patients are subject to a greater risk of developing disease, and who therefore would benefit from preventive therapies. Molecular diagnostic products may also guide a patients healthcare to ensure the patient receives the most appropriate drug at the optimal dose. Every week, disease-linked genetic variations are being discovered. Genetic tests are now available for over 4,000 diseases and conditions. Once only a niche market of the in vitro diagnostics industry, molecular genetic testing is playing an increasingly valuable and prominent role in health care. In all areas of medicine, DNA based tests are assisting clinicians in the management of diseases and in the selection of treatment by enabling earlier diagnosis or prediction of disease risk years before symptoms occur. The domestic market for molecular diagnostics is a multi-billion dollar market and is the strongest segment of the entire in vitro diagnostics market, growing at an annual average rate of over 20%. 
 We believe there are significant diagnostic market opportunities for disease identification. Simple, non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests do not exist for many of the major diseases affecting women and men. Unlike traditional medical tests, molecular genetic tests are often proprietary, high-margin tests that can move quickly from discovery to commercialization, particularly in a CAP and CLIA approved laboratory as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT), for which the FDA currently exercises enforcement discretion.
 In general, accurate early detection, disease identification and assessment of health status can translate into reduced morbidity, improved quality of life and reduced treatment costs associated with detection and treatment of disease during later stages. 
 
Technology and Products in Development
 
Juneau Biosciences, LLC has established a core team of physicians and scientists as well as state-of-the-art genetic analysis technologies to identify disease-associated genes in the field of womens health using clinical genetics. Juneau has the medical and patient resources which many biotechnology companies lack in disease areas of interest to Predictive. Based in Utah, Juneaus clinical network accesses the millions of living descendants of the original pioneers who settled in this region. Juneau believes that these large, genetically heterogeneous families who are well informed of their genealogy comprise the best population in the world for discovering human disease genes. In short, Juneau believes that it can move from clinical need to clinical trials more efficiently than many other companies.
 
We recently acquired DNA and ancestry assets, including significant genetic data related to womens diseases and degenerative disc disease. The acquired assets include: (i) approximately 1,000 degenerative disc disease-related DNA samples, related family records, relevant clinical records (including approximately 600 affected probands) and 800 ancestry matched control samples, (ii) whole exome sequencing data on approximately 300 degenerative disc disease samples, over 800 local controls, and published reference populations, together with initial analysis of the markers, and (iii) exclusive use of a DNA biobank that has collected over 300,000 samples for multiple diseases that the Company may target. 
 -6-
 
The acquisition of these DNA and ancestry assets strengthens our development platforms to commercialize gene-based diagnostics and biotechnology treatments for other debilitating diseases, such as additional difficult-to-diagnose womens health diseases and degenerative disc disease. These assets are complementary to our recent acquisition of Inception Dx, LLC, which included ancestry database records for over 31.9 million individuals for use in genetics research. We also acquired Taueret Laboratories, LLC, a fully certified genetic testing laboratory, for the purpose of processing our genetic testing products.
 In the future, Predictive intends to develop additional diagnostics and therapeutics utilizing the development assets described above. In the near-term, the Company will focus its resources on commercializing the ARTguide™, existing Regenerative Medicine Products and improvements to existing commercialized products.
 Tissue Availability and Laboratory Processing 
 
Our regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps are derived from the Whartons Jelly layer of the umbilical cord and from placental tissue. We obtain these tissues from donors in various parts of the country. Tissues are procured, processed, and tested in our laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah to meet standards established by FDA. We are dependent on donors to supply us with sufficient umbilical cord and placental tissue to manufacture our four key regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps. To date, we have been able to secure sufficient donated tissues to meet our manufacturing needs. In the event we are not able to secure required tissue, it will directly impact the quantity of regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps that we are able to manufacture.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
In striving to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, we currently rely heavily on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications, in conjunction with our trade secrets and know-how, in order to further protect our molecular diagnostic, therapeutics, regenerative medicine platform and derivative technologies, as well as the manufacturing and deployment processes of those technologies.

In the field of the prediction, prognosis, or diagnosis or therapeutic assessment of endometriosis in infertility and/or pelvic pain and/or dysmenorrhea patients using genetic data, we have exclusive license rights to 3 issued U.S. patents, 4 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, 17 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and 2 PCT International Patent Applications.
Intellectual Property Related to Spine Diseases
 Related to the diagnosis and treatment of spine diseases, we own 5 issued U.S. patents that begin to expire in 2026 and 1 pending U.S. provisional patent application.
 Intellectual Property Related to Regenerative Medicine Products and HCT/Ps
 Related to the processing of human cell tissue, we own 1 pending U.S. provisional patent application, 5 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and 1 PCT International Patent Applications.
 REIMBURSEMENT
 
Our ARTguide™ and current regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps are targeted as self-pay markets and, to date, substantially all of our revenues are self-pay. To the extent ARTguide™, our current regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps or any future products and/or future services we offer are reimbursed such transactions will be subject to additional regulation. In addition, in the United States, demand for access to many medical products will depend in large part on both the availability and the amount of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and commercial healthcare insurers, including managed care organizations and other private health plans. Third-party payers have complex rules and requirements for coverage and reimbursement of healthcare products and services. Even the applications to such third-party payers to be eligible for reimbursement for product or services are complex and can be lengthy and time consuming. For new technologies coming to market, these payers are increasingly examining the clinical evidence supporting medical necessity and cost effectiveness decisions in addition to safety and efficacy, which can result in barriers to early coverage reimbursement, or denial of coverage and reimbursement altogether. Accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the availability of coverage and reimbursement status for new medical products. If third-party payer reimbursement is unavailable to our customer hospitals, physicians, and providers, our sales may be limited and we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
Payers often set payment rates depending on the site of service and many use the Medicare program as a benchmark for their own payment methodologies. In the hospital inpatient setting, Medicare payment generally is set at pre-determined rates for all products and services provided during a particular patient stay and is based on such factors as the patient diagnosis, procedures performed, patient age, and complications. In the physician office or clinic setting, Medicare payment generally is based on a fee schedule, with payment rates set for each procedure performed and product used, although the schedule may in some instance bundle the product into the payment for the procedure. In some outpatient settings, such as in the case of the hospital outpatient clinic setting, Medicare payment rates generally are premised on classifications of services that have similar clinical characteristics and similar costs.
 
Reimbursement policies depend in part on legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry and federal and state governments continue to propose and pass new healthcare legislation and government agencies revise or change their regulations and policies from time to time. We cannot predict whether or how such reform measures and policy changes would affect reimbursement rates and demand for our products.

COMPETITION
 
Competition is intense in diagnostic, regenerative medicine products, and HCT/Ps markets. Our potential competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies, diagnostic reference laboratories, biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. Many potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. We expect competition to intensify in our current fields as technical advances occur and become more widely known.
 
The technologies for (i) discovering genes that cause major diseases, (ii) methods, processes and discoveries related to HCT/Ps, and (iii) approaches for commercializing those discoveries are rapidly evolving. Rapid technological developments could result in our services, products, or processes becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of our related research and development costs and associated capital expenditures. If we do not launch our services or products before our competitors, we could be adversely affected. Moreover, any products that we develop could be made obsolete by less expensive or more effective tests or methods that may be developed in the future. 
 
There are a number of established pharmaceutical companies that have franchises in the womens health area. These include: AbbVie, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca, Teva/ Barr Laboratories, Bayer Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Neurocrine, Merck Novartis Corporation / Serono, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Inc. /Wyeth, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi Aventis, and others. These companies are principally focused in the areas of HRT, contraception, osteoporosis and/or infertility based on their existing products and R&D pipeline. We view these companies as potential partners. Our gene discovery and target validation technologies will create a natural "fit" between our capabilities and large pharmaceutical companies chemical libraries, preclinical/clinical development, and sales and marketing capabilities. 
 
We face significant competition in the regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps market. Our competitors include Alliqua, American Cryo, Athersys, AxoGen, Biodesix, Biotime, Burst Biologics, Compugen, DermaSciences, Human Regenerative Technologies, International Stem Cell, Invitrix, Lifecell, Liveyon, Longeveron, MiMeDx, Misoblast, MTF (Musculoskeletal Tissue Foundation), Orthofix, Osiris, Pluristem, Polarity, Regenerexx, TEI Biosciences, TissueTech, Wright, and Xtant. We believe that our HCT/Ps processing and preserving technologies deliver superior products and provide us with a competitive edge over other industry players.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
General
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our products and services and in our ongoing research and development activities. The therapeutic products, and some of the molecular diagnostic products, regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps to be developed, will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, and marketing of therapeutic products, regenerative medicine products and HCT/Ps. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain regulatory approval or any delay in obtaining regulatory approval could have a material adverse affect on our business.
 -9-
 
Molecular Diagnostics
 
Our laboratory that is running ARTguide™ and our future molecular diagnostic tests is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, and local levels as a clinical laboratory. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, provide for the regulation of clinical laboratories by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and our diagnostic laboratory is subject to HHS regulations, which mandate that all clinical laboratories be certified to perform testing on human specimens and provide specific conditions for certification. These regulations also contain guidelines for the qualification, responsibilities, training, working conditions and oversight of clinical laboratory employees. In addition, specific standards are imposed for each type of test that is performed in a laboratory. CLIA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are enforced through quality inspections of test methods, equipment, instrumentation, materials and supplies on a periodic basis. Any change in CLIA or these regulations or in the interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other medical devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests (LDTs), but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories and that are marketed to physicians. 
 
The FDA published draft guidance documents regulating LDTs. It is anticipated that regulation, if it occurs, will commence with high risk tests and proceed to low risk tests over time. If the FDA should require that our tests receive FDA approval prior to their commercial launch, there can be no assurance such approval would be received on a timely basis, if at all. At present, ARTguide™ does not require FDA approval before commercial launch. 
 
The FDA has considered LDT regulations since 1992. Any attempt by the FDA to regulate LDTs now would be controversial, difficult to administer and likely to trigger legal challenges from the industry. A large number of medical laboratory tests enjoying broad clinical acceptance are LDTs that have been in use for decades and are run daily in labs throughout the country. FDA regulation of the entire menu of tests that currently fall under the legal definition of LDTs would be disruptive to patient care. Requiring regularly used and long-accepted LDTs to have FDA approval would drive health care costs up.
 
LDTs are in vitro assays that clinical laboratories develop as testing services according to their own procedures. These tests are often created in response to unmet clinical needs, and are commonly used for early and precise diagnosis, monitoring, and guidance of patient treatment. LDTs are also used to diagnose and assess diseases and disorders for which no FDA-authorized test kit currently exists, such as rare diseases, or those with small patient populations. In some cases, LDTs represent the standard of care. The ability of laboratories to develop custom diagnostic tests has been critical to the growth of personalized medicine and to keeping pace with the changing face of disease.

Medical laboratories are highly regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988. High complexity laboratories must undergo additional certification to ensure the clinical validity of tests. CLIA regulations address personnel qualifications, quality control procedures, and proficiency testing programs. CLIA contains different complexity categories to describe the degree of expertise a laboratory will be required to have, and the standards that it will need to meet, in order to perform a particular test of a given type. All laboratories performing molecular diagnostic testing must be CLIA High Complexity Laboratories. 
 
More than 95% of current and more than 95% of new high margin tests are performed as LDTs. Molecular test development by laboratories under CLIA has become the diagnostic or prognostic standard of care for many diseases or conditions. Under CLIA, the laboratory director, without external review, determines the analytical validity of LDTs. The laboratory is not required by CLIA to demonstrate that the test is clinically valid. The laboratory must develop the test itself and must manufacture the test. The laboratory performing the test must have CLIA approval and approval of any relevant state regulators. 
 -10-
 
Typically molecular genetics laboratories have accreditation from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and generally the lab director meets professional certification requirements. Some states have implemented regulations concerning molecular diagnostic testing that require licensing or registration of general clinical laboratory activities. 
 
We believe that we will be able to take all steps required in various jurisdictions in order for us to conduct business in those jurisdictions. Failure to maintain state regulatory compliance, or changes in state regulatory schemes, could result in a substantial curtailment or even prohibition of our clinical activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Human Cell and Tissue Products (HCT/Ps)
 
The FDA has specific regulations governing the manufacture and commercialization of HCT/Ps and the level of these regulations by the FDA, depending on whether the procedure falls solely within the scope of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. § 264) or if they are regulated as drugs, devices, and/or biological products under Section 351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. § 262) and/or the FD&C Act.
 
If an HCT/P meets the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called 361 HCT/Ps), no premarket FDA review for safety and effectiveness under a drug, device, or biological product marketing application is required. However, the processor of the tissue is required to register and list its products with the FDA, comply with regulations regarding labeling, record keeping, donor eligibility and screening and testing, process the tissue in accordance with established current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP), and investigate and, in certain circumstances, report adverse events or deviations.
 
To be a Section 361 HCT/P, a product generally must meet all four of the following criteria:
 1) It must be minimally manipulated;
 2) It must be intended for homologous use;
 3) Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent, provided the addition of such article does not raise new clinical safety concerns; and
 4) It must not have a systemic effect and must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function (unless the product is intended for reproductive use, autologous use, or use in a first- or second-degree blood relative).
 
We have successfully completed an FDA audit, and management believes our structural umbilical cord tissue product qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps. Other regenerative medicine products and product candidates that we have developed or have commercialized are being evaluated with respect to regulatory classification. We plan to prepare for any regulatory pathway that is required. Other HCT/Ps we are developing are being evaluated with respect to regulatory classification, and we will prepare for any pathway of manufacturing or regulation that is required.
 
All establishments that manufacture Section 361 HCT/Ps must register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) within five days after commencing operations. In addition, establishments are required to update their registration annually in December or within 30 days of certain changes, and submit changes in HCT/P listing at the time of or within six months of such change. Establishments that manufacture Section 361 HCT/Ps will know that they are registered in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10(a) when they receive a validated form with the registration number (FEI#) after submitting the Form FDA 3356 (registration form). Applicable GTP requirements govern the facilities, controls, and methods used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including without limitation, recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution of 361 HCT/Ps. FDA inspection and enforcement with respect to establishments described in 21 C.F.R. § 1271 includes inspections conducted, as deemed necessary, to determine compliance with the applicable provisions and may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of the establishments facilities, equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, processes, HCT/Ps, procedures, labeling, records, files, papers, and controls required to be maintained under 21 C.F.R. § 1271. Such inspections can occur at any time with or without written notice at such frequency as is determined by the FDA in its sole discretion.
 -11-
 
Our subsidiary, Predictive Biotech, successfully completed an FDA inspection of its lab in October 2018. This inspection included the review of all of the Companys SOPs, manufacturing processes and marketing material. The Company resolved and reported back to the FDA on 2 items that were identified on the FDAs standard 483 form. The Company is currently listed on the FDAs database as a Company in good standing under the status of No Action Indicated (NAI).
 
We believe that we are operating our HCT/Ps business in compliance with applicable FDA regulations and other applicable laws. 
 
Therapeutics
 
We intend to partner with one or more pharmaceutical partners to develop therapeutic products which will be subject to regulation by the FDA and require approval before they may be clinically tested and commercially marketed for human therapeutic use in the United States and other countries. The precise regulatory requirements with which we will have to comply are undergoing periodic revisions and refinement.
 
The steps required before a therapeutic product may be marketed in the United States are numerous and include, but are not limited to the following:
 
- completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, chemical process development, and formulation studies; 
 - the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence;
 - performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended use;
 - the submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA; and
 - FDA approval of the NDA, including approval of all product labeling and initial advertising.
 The testing and approval process required to market a therapeutic product involves substantial time, effort, and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our future therapeutic products will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential Phases that may overlap:
 
- PHASE 1: Initial safety study in healthy human subjects or patients where the candidate therapy is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
- PHASE 2: Studies in a limited patient population designed to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine tolerance and optimal dosage.
- PHASE 3: Studies in an expanded patient population to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety.
 -12-
 
We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any compound within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or indication. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon us or our partners activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant any approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approval is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our suppliers will be able to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and other potential referral sources for our products pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and similar laws. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation. We could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time we may find that we are at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.
 
In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of, a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) has issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, exclude certain specified remuneration and remunerative arrangements from being violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by Government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. Many states have laws similar to the federal law.

Also, the federal civil False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the governments recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the governments damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The DOJ takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks, may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid by health care providers that use the manufacturers products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements (CIAs) that require, among other things, substantial government oversight, as well as reporting and remedial actions going forward.
 
If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to:
 - Multi-year investigations by federal and state governments;
 - Criminal and civil fines and penalties;
 - Obligations under settlement agreements, such as CIAs or Deferred Prosecution Agreements; and/or
 - Exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. 
 
Other Regulations
 
In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA, among other things, required HHS to issue regulations that are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the transfer of health information along with protecting the confidentiality and security of health information. Specifically, Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains four provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions. We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations and maintain an active program designed to address regulatory compliance issues. Penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA include both civil and criminal penalties. Violations could result in civil penalties of up to $25,000 per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per violation.

The privacy regulations protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The penalties for violation of state privacy laws may vary widely and new privacy laws in this area are pending. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with all applicable health information privacy and confidentiality statutes and regulations. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
HHS has regulations which establish standards for electronic transactions and for code sets to be used in those transactions. They also contain requirements concerning the use of these standards by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers. In addition, HHS has security regulations which establish standards for the security of electronic protected health information to be implemented by health plans, healthcare clearinghouse, and certain healthcare providers. We believe we have taken the steps required of it to comply with both the transactions and code sets as well as the security regulations. However, failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Our business is also subject to regulation under state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances control, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, and the Toxic Substance Control Act. We believe that we are in material compliance with these and other applicable laws and that the costs of our ongoing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business. However, statutes or regulations applicable to our business may be adopted which could impose substantial additional costs to assure compliance and/or otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations.
