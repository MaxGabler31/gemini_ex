Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 17, 2017. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we have focused on businesses with a connection to India. We have entered into a definitive agreement for an initial business combination, which remains subject to approval by our shareholders, in each case as described further below.
 
We have assembled a group of directors, including independent directors, who provide experience in public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets. Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEO’s or CFO’s, or in other executive and advisory capacities for publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation. We believe our management teams’ backgrounds provide us with the ability to source transactions and identify companies that can thrive in a public-listing environment. We believe this experience is a significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates and assist us in completing an initial business combination. Additionally, over the course of their careers, our management team, board and advisors have developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships, which we believe will provide us with an important source of transaction opportunities, although there can be no assurance of this.
 
Donald R. Caldwell has over 40 years of experience as an investor, entrepreneur and as an officer and director of public and private companies and has led numerous initial public offerings and acquisitions. Our Chief Executive Officer and director, F. Jacob Cherian, has over 23 years of experience in acquisitions, investment, publicly listed companies, business restructuring and improving business value. Our Chief Financial Officer, Suhel Kanuga, has over 19 years of business experience in acquisition, investment, publicly listed companies and financial services. Roman Franklin, one of our director nominees, has expertise in wealth management, investment, and has been involved in multiple business transactions tied to India. Max Hooper, one of our directors, has over 35 years of experience as an investor and entrepreneur with expertise in investment, management and mergers and acquisitions over various industries as well as experience with special purpose acquisition companies in terms of transaction structuring, administration, research, and execution. Edward Leonard Jaroski, one of our directors, has extensive experience in investments and asset management. Another director, William H. Herrmann, Jr., has over 40 years of experience in financial services, and insurance and investment planning industries. Aalap B. Merchant, the special advisor to our board of directors, has over 15 years of experience in the financial markets across the United States and India involving corporate finance advisory (including strategic and M&A advisory, capital markets, structured finance), financial consulting, sales and trading and financial operations. In addition, Messrs. Cherian and Kanuga were the officers and directors of Millennium Investment & Acquisition Co., Inc. (formerly Millennium India Acquisition Company Inc.) (“Millennium India”), a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which conducted an initial public offering of $58 million and, after seeking shareholder approval to clarify the definition of a business combination to allow for the purchase of a minority interest, consummated a business combination with SMC Global Securities Ltd. (“SMC”), an India-headquartered diversified financial services company with over 2,500 locations in over 500 cities in India serving over approximately 1.7 million investors and SAM Global Securities Limited (“SAM”). Millennium India acquired a 14.9% interest in each of SMC and SAM. Messrs. Cherian and Kanuga played active roles throughout the business combination transaction for Millennium India. The surviving entity subsequently registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. With respect to such transaction, past performance is not a guarantee that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate.
 
Prior to the consummation of a business combination, we intend to leverage the experience and expertise of our executive officers, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities, by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business or businesses located in India and negotiating the terms of such transaction. Subsequent to the consummation of a business combination, we believe that the strengths of our management team, particularly their extensive experience in public company corporate governance, financial reporting, operations oversight, corporate development and risk management, will be valuable with respect to contributing to the ongoing operations of any business we may acquire.
 
On May 3, 2018, we entered into a share subscription agreement (as amended by the First Amendment Cum Addendum, dated June 22, 2018, the “Subscription Agreement”), with Smaaash Entertainment Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of India (“Smaaash”), Shripal Morakhia (“Morakhia”), and AHA Holdings Private Limited (“AHA Holdings”, and together with Morakhia, the “Smaaash Founders”), pursuant to which we will contribute a cash amount of up to $49 million (the “Investment Amount”) to Smaaash in exchange for (i) up to 89,583,215 newly issued equity shares of Smaaash (the “Investment”) and (ii) the right to act as the sole distributor of Smaaash’s active entertainment games in North and South America and (iii) the right to act as the master franchisee for Smaaash’s active entertainment centers in North and South America (the “Transaction”). Assuming a cash contribution amount of $49 million, the equity shares we receive would represent approximately 27.53% of the equity capital of Smaaash; provided that such percentage shall be decreased proportionately depending on the number of shares of our common stock that the public holders of our common stock elect to redeem in connection with the vote on the transaction and the resulting reduction in funds available for contribution to Smaaash. Consummation of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their share of common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in our trust account (net of taxes payable and up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital released to us).

The Subscription Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company on May 9, 2018 and June 28, 2018. For additional information regarding Smaaash, the Subscription Agreement and the Transaction, see the Proxy Statement.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report assumes that the closing of the Transaction will not occur.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
Since inception, all of our activities have related to our formation, IPO, which is described below, and identifying a target company for an initial business combination.
 
On August 22, 2017, we consummated our IPO of 5,000,000 units (“public units”), each unit consisting of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-219251), which was declared effective on August 16, 2017. The public units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 254,500 units (the “private placement units”) to I-AM Capital Partners LLC, our sponsor, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,545,000. On September 13, 2017, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option and purchased 200,000 public units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,000,000. Simultaneously with the sale of the public units, we consummated the sale of an additional 7,000 private placement units, generating gross proceeds of $70,000.
 
Transaction costs related to the IPO amounted to $3,728,000, consisting of $1,430,000 of underwriting fees ($930,000 in cash and $500,000 in shares of common stock), $1,820,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $478,000 of IPO costs. As of May 31, 2018, $458,063 of cash was held outside of the trust account and was available for working capital purposes. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $1,820,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be released from the trust account upon consummation of an initial business combination, if consummated) and the estimated offering expenses, the total net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement was $53,221,220, of which $52,780,000 (or $10.15 per unit sold in the IPO) was placed in the trust account.
 
Our units began trading on August 22, 2017 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “IAMU.” Commencing on October 9, 2017, the units ceased trading and separated into their component securities, which share of common stock, rights and public warrants began separately trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “IAM”, “IAMXR” and “IAMXW,” respectively.
 
The Proposed Initial Business Combination with Smaaash
 
As discussed above, on May 3, 2018, we entered into the Subscription Agreement and related agreements. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, we will invest into Smaaash the funds held in the trust account, less transaction expenses, amounts used to pay our stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection with the vote to approve the Transaction, and reserves for liquidation and liquidation expenses, in exchange for equity shares of Smaaash. We estimate that if $49.0 million is invested in Smaaash, the equity shares issued by Smaaash will constitute up to approximately 27.53% of the issued share capital of Smaaash, provided that such percentage shall decrease proportionately depending on the number of shares redeemed by our public stockholders.
 
In connection with the Investment, we shall change its name to “Smaaash Entertainment Inc.” and shall receive the right under the Master Distribution Agreement and the Master Franchise Agreement to become (i) the sole distributor of Smaaash games in North America and South America and (ii) the master franchisee for Smaaash centers in North America and South America. After the Transaction, we shall also pursue acquisitions within the active entertainment industry in the United States with the objective of facilitating the transformation of Smaaash from an India focused company to a globally recognized brand within the active entertainment industry.
 
In connection with, and as a condition to, the Investment, the Shareholders’ Agreement that we previously entered into, pursuant to which we will have the right to, among other things, appoint two directors and jointly consent to the appointment of three additional directors to the board of directors of Smaaash (which board may have up to 10 directors), will become effective.

For additional information regarding the Transaction, please see the Proxy Statement.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
We will have until August 22, 2018 to consummate our initial business combination. There is a risk that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by August 22, 2018. We may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account approximately $292,000, or approximately $335,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0583 per unit in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of approximately $875,000 (or approximately $1,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) if extended three times, or $0.1750 per unit. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. In the event that interest in the trust is available for withdrawal for working capital purposes (up to a maximum of $600,000) and has not been used to pay taxes or other working capital expenses, we may apply the accrued interest in the trust account or such withdrawn interest to the sponsor’s obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension, and the amount that our sponsor would be obligated to loan us in connection with such extension would be reduced by the amount of interest so applied. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the rights and warrants will be worthless.
 
Nasdaq rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination.
 
In the event the Transaction is not consummated and we attempt to consummate an alternative business combination, we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% net asset test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% net asset test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at any time, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination.
 
We believe that the Indian economy presents attractive opportunities for growth and a favorable area in which to attempt to consummate a business combination. Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience with transactions related to India, which will be valuable for us in sourcing, diligencing and structuring a business combination.

Acquisition Criteria
 
The members of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience as well as significant experience in evaluating companies and potential transactions, including, but not limited to, the evaluations done in relation with previous blank check companies. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will be useful for sourcing investment opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team’s experience in:

● | sourcing, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
Our evaluation strategy comprises a combination of inclusion and exclusion criteria. We intend to pursue both well-run companies as well as turnaround opportunities as long as they satisfy our selection criteria. Well-run companies are characterized by high return on equity, superior operating margins, robust earnings growth over a period of time, strong cash conversion cycles as well as healthy balance sheets. We will seek well-run companies that need additional growth capital or need to provide an exit to an existing stockholder.
 
In the case of turnaround opportunities, we expect to only acquire companies where we can utilize our operating expertise, industry networks and capital to implement a turnaround plan that addresses key aspects of underperformance. The ideal turnaround candidates are those that may require a recapitalization, improvements in working capital management, operational improvements that result in margin expansion, or those that could benefit from the application of new technology that could improve productivity or new business orders.
 
The inclusion criteria we intend to utilize are:
 

● | Opportunities in the faster-growing segments of the economy, including consumer, technology and services driven companies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses with multiple, diverse potential drivers of revenue and earnings growth
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies with potential for strong free cash flow generation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Under-valued companies impacted by rapidly shifting market dynamics, market dislocations, gaps in understanding of a company’s future prospects, or liquidity-driven valuation discounts
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform for continued growth through serial acquisitions, organic growth in existing business or new business initiatives
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The exclusion criteria we intend to utilize in terms of target selection are:
 

● | Companies exposed to significant regulatory control
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Controversial industry sectors such as gambling or tobacco products
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low gross margin sectors
--+-------------------------


● | Companies with binary events in their future relating to key product litigation, regulations or intellectual property
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Asset-light businesses such as consulting firms
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Red flags such as frequent labor unrest, high management turnover, accounting irregularities, pending regulatory action, environmental issues, etc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective target businesses, including Smaaash, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see the justifications to do so. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a public company. We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely be reduced in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. Being public can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.
 
Financial position. With funds held in trust available for our initial business combination in the amount of $52,895,652 as of May 31, 2018, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. If needed, we may take steps to secure additional third party financing to fund our initial business combination.
 
Management Operating and Investing Experience.  Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. We will seek to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses or assets in the energy sector, although we may pursue a business combination outside of such industry.
 
We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will complete an initial business combination nor is there any guarantee that such an initial business combination will be successful. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination is completed, if at all.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to redeem share of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to either repay or issue private warrants upon conversion of up to $1,500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive operations until the closing of our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of the private placement units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
We intend to effect the Transaction using cash held in our trust account and, if needed, funds from third party sources. In the event we do not consummate the Transaction, we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with other target businesses, but we may, as a result of our limited resources, effect only a single business combination.
 
Origination and sourcing of target business opportunities
 
We believe our management team’s extensive target sourcing and transaction experience, including in connection with previous blank check companies, along with relationships with intermediaries and companies, will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our board and management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has been developed over the course of an aggregate of over 24 years, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer.
 
We expect that the management team’s network of existing contacts and relationships will be able to deliver a flow of potential platform and add-on acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of established, credentialed buyers have been invited to participate in the sale process. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors.
 
In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our SEC filings and know what types of businesses we are targeting.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our executive officers may currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Nasdaq rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination.
 
 7

 

Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that the additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under Nasdaq listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

● | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted purchases of our securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
 8

 

In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.15 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional $0.1750 per unit in the event that our sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report). The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholder has entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares it may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
Manner of conducting redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
 9

 

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholder has agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, assuming the minimum number of stockholders required for a quorum are present at the stockholders’ meeting held to approve our initial business combination, we would need only 141,876, or approximately 2.73%, of the 5,200,000 public shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholder has entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon the consummation of our initial business combination to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
 
By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
 10

 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report).
 
Ability to extend time to complete business combination
 
If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by August 22, 2018, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account approximately $292,000, or $335,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0583 per unit in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of approximately $875,000 (or approximately $1,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) if extended three times, or $0.1750 per unit. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. In the event that interest in the trust is available for withdrawal for working capital purposes and has not been used to pay taxes or other working capital expenses, we may apply the accrued interest in the trust account or such withdrawn interest to the sponsor’s obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension, and the amount that our sponsor would be obligated to loan us in connection with such extension would be reduced by the amount of interest so applied.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
Our executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we will have only 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the applicable time period we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the applicable time period.
 
Our initial stockholder has entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which it has waived its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report). However, if our initial stockholder acquires public shares, it will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the applicable time period.
 
Our executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If in connection with any such redemption, an excessive number of public shares are redeemed such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial stockholder, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restriction.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $458,063 held outside the trust account, although there may not be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes and not released to us to fund up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital expenses, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.15 (or such higher amount then held in trust). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be substantially less than $10.15 (or such higher amount then held in trust). Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we may not have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
 12

 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.15 per public share (or such higher amount then held in trust) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.15 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and our stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. None of our officers and directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.15 per public share (or such higher amount then held in trust) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital expenses, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be substantially less than $10.15 per share (or such higher amount then held in trust).
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $458,063 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital expenses and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 21st month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281 (b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.15 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes or up to a maximum of $600,000 of working capital expenses and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report) and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return $10.15 per share (or such higher amount then held in trust) to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Employees
 
We have two executive officers. Members of the management team are not and will not be obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to its affairs until the initial business combination is complete. The amount of time that members of management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the initial business combination and the current stage, if any, of any business combination. We have one full time administrative employee and do not intend to have any other employees prior to the completion of the initial business combination.
