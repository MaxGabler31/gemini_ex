Item 1.    Business.
General
The Goldfield Corporation, incorporated in Wyoming in 1906 and subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in 1968, is engaged in both the construction of electrical infrastructure for the utility industry and industrial customers and to a considerably lesser extent real estate development. Real estate development represented 1% of our total revenue in 2018. The principal market for the electrical construction operation is primarily in the Southeast, mid-Atlantic and Texas-Southwest regions of the United States. The primary focus of the real estate operations is on the development of residential properties on the east coast of Central Florida. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Goldfield,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” as used herein mean The Goldfield Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our operations were exclusively in the United States.
Employees
As of March 3, 2019, we had a total of 487 employees, which included 480 full-time and seven part-time employees. These employees included 108 unionized employees at our subsidiary, C and C Power Line, Inc. (“C&C”). The total number of employees includes 427 hourly-rate employees. The number of hourly-rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Historically, a significant portion of our revenue has come from several different customers each year. Our largest customers may change from year to year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top three customers accounted for approximately 57.2% of our consolidated revenue. Since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year, we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer.
It is our policy to commit ourselves only to the amount of work we believe we can properly supervise, equip and complete to the customer’s satisfaction and timetable. As a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects 
1

undertaken by us, a substantial portion of our annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers that exceed 10% of total sales.
Construction is customarily performed pursuant to plans and specifications of customers. We generally supply the management, labor, equipment and tools, while customers generally supply most of the required materials, however we generally supply most of the required materials for the construction of concrete foundations. We are not presently experiencing, nor do we anticipate experiencing, any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials. 
Revenue and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns and system loads. Project duration varies based on project type, complexity, applicable environmental regulations and customer requirements.
We enter into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding, direct negotiations or pursuant to master service agreements (“MSAs”). Competitively bid contracts and MSAs account for a majority of our electrical construction revenue. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken, such contracts are typically lump sum (fixed-price) contracts, time plus equipment contracts, or unit price contracts. Most of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services, and some of our contracts are cancelable on short notice. 
In certain circumstances, we are required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a surety to secure our contractual commitments. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand the surety to make payments or provide services under the bond. No bond issued for us has ever been called by a customer. Under current circumstances we believe that we will not need to fund any claims written by our surety in the foreseeable future. At present, we have adequate bonding availability for our operations. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of our electrical construction subsidiaries amounted to $46.4 million. 
Contracts may include retention provisions. From 5% to 10% is withheld by the customer from progress payments as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.
Backlog
Our backlog represents future services to be performed under existing project-specific fixed-price and maintenance contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under our existing MSAs.
The following table presents our total backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months and during the life of each of the MSAs. When awarded, our MSA initial terms range from one to seven years. Most of the MSAs have remaining renewals ranging from one to three years at the option of the customer. The calculation assumes exercise of the renewal options by the customer. Revenue from assumed exercise of renewal options represents $45.8 million (26.9%) of our total estimated MSA backlog as of December 31, 2018. 

 | Backlog as of | | Backlog as of 
 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
Electrical Construction Operations | 12-Month | | Total | | 12-Month | | Total 
Project-Specific Firm Contracts (1) | $ | 44,373,384 | | | $ | 44,373,384 | | $ | 27,110,793 | $ | 27,110,793 
Estimated MSAs | 57,464,231 | | | 170,097,919 | | | 83,124,471 | | 187,047,802
Total | $ | 101,837,615 | | | $ | 214,471,303 | | $ | 110,235,264 | $ | 214,158,595
_________________________ | | | | | | | 
(1)Amount includes firm contract awards under MSA agreements.

Our total backlog as of December 31, 2018, increased $313,000, or 0.1%, to $214.5 million, compared to $214.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase in total backlog is primarily due to the increase in MSA firm projects, which includes the addition of four new MSA customers for 2018, offset by existing MSA backlog run-off and adjustments to existing MSA backlog estimates. 
Our 12-month backlog as of December 31, 2018, decreased $8.4 million, or 7.6%, to $101.8 million, mainly due to MSA backlog run-off and adjustments to existing MSA backlog estimates. 
Of our total backlog as of December 31, 2018, we expect approximately $101.8 million, or 47.5%, to be completed during 2019.
Backlog is estimated at a particular point in time and is not determinative of total revenue in any particular period. It does not reflect future revenue from a significant number of short-term projects undertaken and completed between the estimated dates. Our electrical construction revenue in 2018 exceeded our 12-month backlog as of December 31, 2017 by 23.9%.

The estimated amount of backlog for work under MSAs is calculated by using recurring historical trends inherent in current MSAs and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer. Our estimated backlog also assumes exercise of existing customer renewal options. Certain MSAs are not exclusive to the Company and, therefore, the size and amount of projects we may be awarded cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, the amount of future revenue from MSA contracts may vary substantially from reported backlog. Even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our backlog, there is no guarantee of profit from the projects awarded under MSAs.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, MSAs accounted for approximately 79.3% and 87.3% of total backlog, respectively. We plan to continue our efforts to grow MSA business. MSA contracts are generally multi-year and should provide improved operating efficiencies.
Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but is a common measurement used in our industry. While we believe that our methodology of calculation is appropriate, such methodology may not be comparable to that employed by other companies. Given the duration of our contracts and MSAs and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of the year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance as to our customers’ requirements or our estimates of backlog.
Reconciliation of Backlog to our Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligation
The following table presents a reconciliation of our total backlog as of December 31, 2018 to our remaining unsatisfied performance obligation as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles:

 | December 31, 2018
Total Backlog | $ | 214,471,303
Estimated MSAs | (170,097,919 | ) 
Estimated Firm (1) | (7,933,373 | ) 
Total Unsatisfied Performance Obligation | $ | 36,440,011 
_________________________ | 
(1) Projects awarded, however backlog contract value was estimated as of December 31, 2018.

The amount of total backlog differs from the amount of our remaining unsatisfied performance obligation as of December 31, 2018 and as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, primarily due to the inclusion of estimates of future revenue under MSA and other service agreements within our backlog estimates, as described above.
Revenue estimates included in our backlog may be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, additions, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to: commercial issues, material deficiencies, permitting, regulatory requirements and adverse weather. Our customers are not contractually committed to a specific level of services under our MSAs (other than project-specific firm contracts under MSAs). While we did not experience any material cancellations during the current period, most of our contracts may be terminated, even if we are not in default under the contract. 
For further information regarding the factors that affect the realizability of profits from our business backlog, please refer to the information set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Competition and Regulation
The electrical construction business is highly competitive. We compete with other independent contractors, including larger regional and national firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Competitive factors include: level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel, worker safety and financial stability. Our management believes that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and rules regarding, among other things, contractor licensing, electrical codes, worker safety and environmental protection. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.

Properties
The Company and its subsidiaries operate with owned or leased offices and facilities located in Florida, South Carolina and Texas. Individually, none of the properties are financially significant to the Company. We believe that such properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained. See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on properties.
Real Estate Development
Through our subsidiary Bayswater Development Corporation and its various subsidiaries (“Bayswater”) we are engaged in the acquisition, development, management and disposition of land and improved properties. The primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential properties along the east coast of Central Florida. 
When we use either of the terms “homes” or “units,” we mean our residential properties, which include detached single-family homes, townhomes and condominiums. References to our homebuilding revenues and similar references refer to revenues derived from the sales of our residential properties, in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
Our customers generally are pre-retirement, retirement or second home buyers seeking higher quality, low maintenance residences.
We generally purchase land and pay for architectural, engineering and various other costs with cash reserves. Construction costs are generally paid with cash reserves or in some cases financed, as specified in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
We acquire land for development only after feasibility and environmental testing has been performed. Architectural, engineering, structural and other plans for the projects are outsourced. In an effort to limit risk on condominium projects, our policy is to obtain a substantial number of contracts for purchase prior to commencing construction, backed by customers’ non-refundable earnest money deposits which are generally 20% of the purchase price. We do not offer financing arrangements to purchasers of our homes. As of December 31, 2018, we had two projects with a total of twenty units under construction in Brevard County, Florida. One project consists of an ocean front five-story building containing fourteen luxury ocean-view condominium units, of which thirteen units were under contract as of December 31, 2018. The second project consists of a six-unit townhome complex with three and four bedroom townhome units, of which three units were under contract as of December 31, 2018. Both projects are expected be completed during 2019. 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned nine vacant parcels of land, eight of which are for future development projects and one is for sale. 
Our historical financial performance in real estate construction is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and, in particular, we expect financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter-to-quarter. Our revenue may therefore fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
The real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with other real estate developers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including: quality, location, design, perceived value, price and reputation in the marketplace. We believe that we have certain competitive advantages including desirable locations, attractive designs and higher quality features not generally offered by other developers in the markets in which we compete.
We are subject to federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding, among other things, zoning, building permits, environmental standards, building moratoriums and building codes. Permits and approvals mandated by regulation for development of any magnitude are often numerous, significantly time-consuming and onerous to obtain, and not guaranteed. We believe that our real estate operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations.
The real estate division administrative offices are located within the Company’s corporate offices in Melbourne, Florida.
