One of our core services is the development, design, engineering, and installation of projects (“Projects”) that reduce the energy and O&M costs of our customers’ facilities. These Projects generally include a variety of measures that incorporate innovative technology and techniques, customized for the facility and designed to improve the efficiency of major building systems, such as heating, ventilation, cooling and lighting systems, while enhancing the comfort and usability of the buildings.
We also offer the ability to incorporate analytical tools that provide improved building energy management capabilities and enable customers to identify opportunities for energy cost savings. We typically commit to customers that our energy efficiency projects will satisfy agreed upon performance standards upon installation or achieve specified increases in energy efficiency. Generally, the forecasted lifetime energy and operating cost savings of the energy efficiency measures we install defrays all or almost all of the cost of such measures. In many cases, we assist customers in obtaining third-party financing, grants, or rebates for the cost of constructing the facility improvements, resulting in little or no upfront capital expenditure by the customer. After a project is complete, we may operate, maintain and repair the customer’s energy systems under a multi-year O&M contract, designed to provide us with recurring revenue and visibility into the customer’s evolving needs.
In addition, we serve certain customers by developing and building small-scale renewable energy plants located at or close to a customer’s site. Depending on the customer’s preference, we will either retain ownership of the completed plant or build it for the customer. Most of our small-scale renewable energy plants to date consist of solar PV installations and plants constructed adjacent to landfills, that use landfill gas (“LFG”) to generate energy. We also design and build, and own, operate and maintain plants that utilize biogas from wastewater treatment processes. Our largest renewable energy project that we operate for a customer uses biomass as the primary source of energy. For information on how we finance the projects that we own and operate, please see the disclosures under Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, Note 9, “Debt and Financing Lease Liabilities” and Note 11, “Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Our Lines of Business
Smart Energy Solutions Projects
Our Smart Energy Solutions Projects are primarily energy efficiency projects, which entail the design, engineering, and installation of an ever-increasing array of innovative technologies and techniques to improve the energy efficiency and control the operation, of a building’s energy- and water-consuming systems. In certain projects, we provide financing and design and construct a central plant or cogeneration system providing power, heat and/or cooling to a building, or a small-scale plant that produces electricity, gas, heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy for a customer, as well as battery energy storage. Our projects generally range in size and scope from a one-month project to design and retrofit a lighting system to a more complex 30-month project to design and install a central plant or cogeneration system or other small-scale plant. Projects we have constructed or are currently working on include designing, engineering and installing energy conservation and resiliency measures across 
school buildings, large, complex energy conservation, and energy security projects for the federal government, and municipal-scale street lighting projects incorporating smart city controls.
O&M
After an energy efficiency or renewable energy project is completed, we often provide ongoing O&M services under multi-year contracts. These services offer end-to-end technical guidance and include operating, maintaining, and repairing facility energy systems, such as boilers, chillers, and building controls, as well as central power and small-scale plants. For larger projects, we frequently maintain staff on-site to perform these services. In addition to providing O&M services for our own projects, we also provide similar services on projects we did not construct for various customers.
Ameresco-owned Energy Assets
Our service offerings also include the sale of electricity, heat, cooling, processed biogas, and renewable biomethane fuel from the portfolio of assets that we own and operate. 
We have constructed and are currently developing, designing, and constructing a wide range of renewable energy plants using:
•biogas (generated from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and the agricultural sector)
•advanced biofuels
•biomass and other bio-derived fuels
•solar PV
•wind and hydro sources of energy
•battery storage 
Most of our renewable energy assets to date have involved the generation and sale of:
•electricity from solar PV
•electricity, thermal, renewable fuel, or biomethane using biogas as a feedstock 
In the case of our biogas-fueled projects, we purchase biogas that otherwise would be combusted or vented, process it, and either use it as a renewable fuel source in our energy plants to produce and sell electricity and/or thermal, or sell it as a renewable fuel source to a third party. We also design and build, and operate and maintain facilities that process biogas into biomethane (or RNG) that can be transported, primarily through the nation’s natural gas pipeline grid or in some cases through tanker trucks, and sold to third parties. For Ameresco-owned and operated energy assets, we typically enter into long-term agreements with third parties for the sale of the energy produced by the facility.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated 147 small-scale renewable energy plants and solar PV installations which generate electricity or deliver renewable gas fuel with a combined capacity of approximately 343 megawatt equivalents (“MWe”), and have energy assets in development and construction with a combined capacity of approximately 414 MWe.
The table below shows the type and number of plants we owned as of December 31, 2021:

Plants Owned and Operated | Quantity
Biogas: RNG | 6 
Biogas: non-RNG | 22 
Solar assets | 116 
Other | 3 
Total plants owned and operated | 147 

Other
Our service and product offerings also include photovoltaic solar energy products and systems (“integrated-PV”), consulting, and enterprise energy management services.
Customer Arrangements
Energy Savings Performance Contracts (“ESPCs”)
For our energy efficiency projects, we typically enter into ESPCs, under which we agree to develop, design, engineer and construct a project and also commit that the project will satisfy agreed upon performance standards that vary from project to 
project. These performance commitments are typically based on the design, capacity, efficiency, or operation of the specific equipment and systems we install. Our commitments generally fall into three categories: 
•Pre-agreed energy reduction commitment: our customer reviews the project design in advance and agrees that, upon or shortly after completion of the installation of the specified equipment comprising the project, the commitment will have been met.
•Equipment-level commitment: we commit to a level of energy use reduction based on the difference in use measured first with the existing equipment and then with the replacement equipment.
•Whole building-level commitment: requires demonstration of energy usage reduction for a whole building, often based on readings of the utility meter where usage is measured. Depending on the project, the measurement and demonstration may be required only once, upon installation, based on an analysis of one or more sample installations, or may be required to be repeated at agreed upon intervals generally over periods of up to 25 years. We often assist these customers in identifying and obtaining financing through rebate programs, grant programs, third-party lenders, and other sources.
Under our contracts, we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside of our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations. These factors include, among others, variations in energy prices and utility rates, weather, facility occupancy schedules, the amount of energy-using equipment in a facility, and the failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly. Typically, our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures. Therefore, to the extent an individual measure underperforms, it may be offset by other measures that overperform during the same period. In the event that an energy efficiency project does not perform according to the agreed upon specifications, our agreements typically allow us to satisfy our obligation by adjusting or modifying the installed equipment, installing additional measures to provide substitute energy savings or paying the customer for lost energy savings based on the assumed conditions specified in the agreement. Many of our equipment supply, local design, and installation subcontracts contain provisions that enable us to seek recourse against our vendors or subcontractors if there is a deficiency in our energy reduction commitment. See “We may have liability to our customers under our ESPCs if our projects fail to deliver the energy use reductions to which we are committed under the contract” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Federal Government Contracts, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) Agreements
The projects that we perform for governmental agencies are governed by particular qualification and contracting regimes. Certain states require qualification with an appropriate state agency as a precondition to performing work or appearing as a qualified energy service provider for state, county, and local agencies within the state. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the states of Colorado and Washington pre-qualify energy service providers and provide contract documents that serve as the starting point for negotiations with potential governmental customers. Most of the work that we perform for the federal government is performed under IDIQ agreements between government agencies and us. These IDIQ agreements allow us to contract with the relevant agencies to implement energy projects, but no work may be performed unless we and the agency agree on a task order or delivery order governing the provision of a specific project. The government agencies enter into contracts for specific projects on a competitive basis. We and our affiliates are currently parties to an IDIQ agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) expiring in 2026. We are also party to similar agreements with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. General Services Administration.
Payments by the federal government for energy efficiency measures are based on the services provided and the products installed but are limited to the savings derived from such measures, calculated in accordance with federal regulatory guidelines and the specific contract’s terms. The savings are typically determined by comparing energy use and other costs before and after the installation of the energy efficiency measures, adjusted for changes that affect energy use and other costs but are not caused by the energy efficiency measures.
Energy Supply Contracts
For projects involving the construction of a small-scale renewable energy plant that we own and operate, we generally enter into (i) long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) to supply electricity, (ii) long-term energy supply agreements (“ESAs”) to supply medium British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) biogas or thermal energy, or (iii) gas purchase agreements (“GPAs”) to supply RNG to a third party. These third parties include, but are not limited to, brokers, traders, utilities, municipalities, industrial facilities, or other large purchasers of energy. The rights to use the site for the plant and the purchase of raw feedstock fuel for the plant are also obtained by us under long-term agreements with terms at least as long as the associated output supply agreement. Our supply agreements typically provide for fixed prices or prices that escalate at a fixed rate or vary based on a market benchmark. See “We may assume responsibility under customer contracts for factors outside our control, including, in connection with some customer projects, the risk that fuel prices will increase” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach is to offer customers customized and comprehensive energy efficiency solutions tailored to meet their economic, operational, and technical needs. The sales, design and construction process for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects recently has been averaging from 18 to 54 months. We identify project opportunities through referrals, requests for proposals (“RFPs”), conferences and events, website, digital campaigns, telemarketing, and repeat business from existing customers. Our direct sales force develops and follows up on customer leads. As of December 31, 2021, we had 179 employees in direct sales.
In preparation for a proposal, our team typically conducts a preliminary audit of the customer’s needs and requirements and identifies areas to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs. We collect and analyze the customer’s utility bill and other data related to energy use. If the bills are complex or numerous, we often utilize our proprietary enterprise energy management software tools to scan, compile and analyze the information. Our experienced engineers visit and assess the customer’s current energy systems and infrastructure. Through our knowledge of the federal, state, and local governmental and utility environments, we assess the availability of energy, utility or environmental-based payments for usage reductions or renewable power generation, which helps us optimize the economic benefits of a proposed project for a customer. Once awarded a project, we perform a more detailed audit of the customer’s facilities, which serves as the basis for the final specifications of the project and final contract terms.
For renewable energy plants that are not built or located on a customer’s site or use sources of energy not within the customer’s control, the sales process also involves the identification of sites with attractive sources of renewable energy and obtaining necessary rights and governmental permits to develop a plant on that site. For example, for LFG projects, we start with gaining control of an LFG resource located close to the prospective customer. For solar and wind projects, we look for sites where utilities are interested in purchasing renewable energy power at rates that are sufficient to make a project feasible. Where governmental agencies control the site and resource, such as a landfill owned by a municipality, the customer may be required to issue an RFP 
to use the site or resource. Once we believe we are likely to obtain the rights to the site and the resource, we seek customers for the energy output of the potential project, with whom we can enter into a long-term PPA.
Customers
We strive to be a trusted sustainability partner creating valued, single-sourced, efficient energy solutions delivered with passion, expertise, teamwork, and a relentless focus on customer satisfaction.
Our customers choose to prioritize efficiency and the development of clean, green energy sources and our solutions are customized to serve the specific needs of each customer and meaningfully reduce or offset their carbon footprint. From energy conservation through a variety of measures to the generation of green, renewable power, our customers and their communities reap the benefits of reducing energy consumption, costs, and associated carbon emissions.
In 2021, we served customers throughout the United States, Canada, the U.K., and Greece and approximately 67.0% of our revenues were derived from federal, state, provincial, or local government entities, including public housing authorities and public universities. Our federal customers include various divisions of the U.S. federal government. The U.S. federal government is considered a single customer and segment for reporting purposes (see table above under “Our Segments”). For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest 20 customers accounted for approximately 64.0% of our total revenues. Other than the U.S. federal government, one customer represented 10.2% of our revenues during this period.
See “Provisions in our government contracts may harm our business, financial condition and operating results” in Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of special considerations applicable to government contracting and “The loss of one of our significant customers or our failure to perform our contract with that customer in accordance with its terms could adversely affect us” in Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion.
Competition
While we face significant competition from a large number of companies, we believe that few offer the objective technical expertise and full range of services we do.
Our principal competitors include:
•Smart Energy Solutions: Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (an Exelon company), Energy Systems Group, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, NORESCO (a unit of Carrier Global Corporation), Schneider Electric, Siemens Building Technologies, and Trane Technologies (an Ingersoll-Rand company). We compete primarily on the basis of our comprehensive, independent offering of energy efficiency and renewable energy services and the breadth and depth of our expertise.
•Renewable energy plants: many large independent power producers and utilities, as well as a large number of developers of renewable energy projects.
•LFG market: primarily large, national project developers and owners of landfills who self-develop projects using LFG from their own landfills. 
•Solar PV market: Borrego Solar Systems, BlueWave Solar, Citizens Energy Group, Clean Energy Collective, Nexamp Inc., SunPower Corp., Solect Energy, and Syncarpha Capital. We compete for renewable energy projects primarily on the basis of our experience, reputation, and ability to identify and complete high quality and cost-effective projects.
•O&M services: EMCOR Energy Services, Comfort Systems USA, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, and Veolia. In this area, we compete primarily on the basis of our expertise and quality of service.
See “We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than we do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, growth rates, and market share” in Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of competition.
Regulatory
Various regulations affect the conduct of our business. Federal and state legislation and regulations enable us to enter into ESPCs with government agencies in the United States. The applicable regulatory requirements for ESPCs differ in each state and between agencies of the federal government.
Our projects must conform to all applicable electric reliability, building and safety, and environmental regulations and codes, which vary from place to place and time to time. Various federal, state, provincial, and local permits are required to construct an energy efficiency project or renewable energy plant.
Renewable energy projects are also subject to specific governmental safety and economic regulation. States and the federal government typically do not regulate the transportation or sale of LFG unless it is combined with and distributed with natural gas, but this is not uniform among states and may change from time to time. States regulate the retail sale and distribution of natural gas to end-users, although regulatory exemptions from regulation are available in some states for limited gas delivery activities, such as sales only to a single customer. The sale and distribution of electricity at the retail level is subject to state and provincial regulation, and the sale and transmission of electricity at the wholesale level is subject to federal regulation. While we do not own or operate retail-level electric distribution systems or wholesale-level transmission systems, the prices for the products we offer can be affected by the tariffs, rules and regulations applicable to such systems, as well as the prices that the owners of such systems are able to charge. The construction of power generation projects typically is regulated at the state and provincial levels, and the operation of these projects also may be subject to state and provincial regulation as “utilities.” At the federal level, the ownership and operation of, and sale of power from, generation facilities may be subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA”), the Federal Power Act (“FPA”), and Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). However, because all of the plants that we have constructed and operated to date are small power “qualifying facilities” under PURPA, they are subject to less regulation under the FPA, PUHCA and related state utility laws than traditional utilities.
If we pursue projects employing different technologies or with a single project electrical capacity greater than 20 megawatts, we could become subject to some of the regulatory schemes which do not apply to our current projects. In addition, the state, provincial, and federal regulations that govern qualifying facilities and other power sellers frequently change, and the effect of these changes on our business cannot be predicted.
LFG power generation facilities require an air emissions permit, which may be difficult to obtain in certain jurisdictions. Renewable energy projects may also be eligible for certain governmental or government-related incentives from time to time, including tax credits, cash payments in lieu of tax credits, and the ability to sell associated environmental attributes, including carbon credits. Government incentives and mandates typically vary by jurisdiction.
Some of the demand reduction services we provide for utilities and institutional customers are subject to regulatory tariffs imposed under federal and state utility laws. In addition, the operation of, and electrical interconnection for, our renewable energy projects are subject to federal, state, or provincial interconnection and federal reliability standards also set forth in utility tariffs. These tariffs specify rules, business practices, and economic terms to which we are subject. The tariffs are drafted by the utilities and approved by the utilities’ state, provincial, or federal regulatory commissions.
See our section entitled “Risks related to Regulations or Governmental Actions” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

In addition, we have a 39% rolling three-year average of diverse promotions among all promotions throughout Ameresco. In 2021, 37% of all management position promotions were employees with diverse backgrounds. Diverse backgrounds include women, ethnicity, veterans, and individuals with a disability. This data represents U.S. employees only due to personal information privacy regulations in Canada and Europe.
Benefits with a Purpose
The health, safety, and well-being of our employees continues to be a top priority at Ameresco. In addition to competitive salaries, we are committed to regularly evaluating a competitive benefits portfolio, striving to provide resources to our employees that assist with work-life balance.
While employee healthcare costs and access to a wide variety of doctors have always been at the top of our criteria list, we also focused our 2022 benefit renewal objectives on expanding our mental health and well-being offerings. We wanted to ensure our employees have a variety of help and resources available, offered in platforms and services they felt comfortable using, should they need it.
In addition, we offered a comprehensive Employee Assistance Plan to all Ameresco employees and their family members should they need assistance with any life planning matters. And in support of some of the new applications and corporate programs, we rolled out memberships to Care.com, Gympass, and the Headspace mobile app.
Energy Outside the Office
Whether it is through our philanthropic activities, our quest to provide an inclusive culture, or our focus on the well-being of our people, Ameresco benefits from the open communication seen between our employees. We encourage activities outside of our offices to enhance the employee experience. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present challenges for in-person gatherings, our employees have continued to find creative ways to interact virtually and in-person with proper safety protocols in place.
Career Advancement
Ameresco strives to implement creative ways for our employees to support career advancement. To facilitate our employees’ career development with a focus on retention, we have improved on the frequency of career path discussions, training, and succession planning. Career path training was offered to all employees in 2021 and we intend to continue it in the coming years. The career path discussions identified specific training programs, mentorship opportunities, continued degree programs and certification programs – all of which will provide the tools necessary to assist our employees in their career development. 
When it comes to the innovative solutions that we deliver to our customers, it is critical for the Ameresco team to be at the forefront. Every month our Corporate Marketing Team hosts a Center of Excellence in Advance Technology training session available to all employees. Each session features a different topic to cover various aspects of Ameresco’s solution portfolio and is presented by our internal subject matter experts. All employees are encouraged to attend live and participate in the Q&A.
In 2021, we invested in a Learning Management System (“LMS”) in our Workday Enterprise Management platform to centralize and have the capability to measure development metrics such as training hours per employee. The new LMS system allows for easy access to training materials and more frequent training as needed.
We provide a tuition reimbursement program to support career development within our organization. In addition, we support employee growth by investing in career advancing certification programs for our employees.
