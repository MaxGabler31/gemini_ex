Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Enzon,” “we” or “us”) is positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and enhance stockholder value.
In September 2020, we initiated a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) for our common and preferred stock, which closed in October 2020 (see below and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), and we realized $43.6 million in gross proceeds. This has enabled us to embark on our plan to realize the value of our approximately $103.4 million NOLs by acquiring potentially profitable businesses or assets. To protect the NOLs, in August 2020, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted a Section 382 rights plan (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
Historically, we have received royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of certain drug products that utilized Enzon’s proprietary technology. In recent years, we have had no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. We have a marketing agreement relating to the drug Vicineum, which, if approved, will potentially generate milestone and royalty payments to us in the future. We cannot assure you that we will earn material future royalties or milestones.
Acquisition Activities
Our Board and our management are actively involved in pursuing, sourcing, reviewing, and evaluating various potential acquisition transactions consistent with our long-term strategy. Our management and our Board have originated a number of potential acquisition opportunities and engaged in discussions with certain potential acquisition targets and financial advisors on behalf of various individual entities, while continuing to evaluate such potential transactions. We will continue to update our stockholders as material developments arise.
Royalty and Milestone Agreements and Revenues
Prior to 2017, we received royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”). In 2020 and 2021 net royalties from PegIntron have not been significant. There is a dispute with Merck regarding royalties (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have a licensing agreement regarding SC Oncaspar and certain other drugs.
In 2021, we earned total milestones revenues of approximately $702,000 from Sesen, Inc. (See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received a license maintenance fee of approximately $28,000 and $30,000, respectively, from Amgen, Inc. in payment of a worldwide, royalty-free non-exclusive right to license Vicineum.  (See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
We have a portfolio of issued U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, one relates to PegIntron. The patent related to PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) expired in the United States in 2016 and expired outside of the United States in 2018 (including any patent term extensions), except for Japan, where the patent expired in 2021, Malaysia, where the patent expired in 2020, and Chile, where it will expire in 2024. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition and we may be entitled to potential royalty rights and/or milestone payments, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or

commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us. At this time, we do not expect to apply for or receive any additional patents.
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Many of our patents have expired or are nearing the end of their patent protection period. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
