Industry Trends and Market Solutions
In-Building Wireless (IBW)
IBW solutions, including DAS and small cell installations, have increased dramatically in the last decade, driven by the trend where more and more mobile communication use is taking place indoors. Recent studies show that over 80% of all mobile communication now either originates or terminates from within buildings. More people are using mobile devices and data-intensive services in areas such as stadiums, arenas, malls, universities, hospitals, airports, resorts, convention centers, office buildings, and other indoor areas not served well or at all by the existing "macro" outdoor cellular network. As end-user bandwidth demands continue to increase, the greater the demand for reliable networks that can manage the increased coverage and capacity requirements.
In addition to the increase in commercial use of mobile devices indoors, demand is also increasing for in-building wireless coverage for the public safety sector. First responders, such as firefighters, police and other law enforcement officers, and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, are also in need of more modern high-bandwidth mobile communication capabilities beyond the traditional two-way land mobile radios (LMRs). Local municipalities with jurisdiction to define in-building public safety coverage are increasingly requiring public safety mobile communication coverage in buildings. Additionally, at the federal level, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) radio spectrum was awarded to AT&T to build-out the first nationwide broadband public safety network, which can carry high-speed data, location information, images, etc. 
During fiscal year 2019, the Company entered into a product agreement with ip.access, a leading small cell solutions provider based in the U.K., to develop and market an OnGo small cell, primarily targeted at the market for private LTE networks. OnGo, the brand name for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), is an LTE-based swath of radio spectrum previously limited to the U.S. Navy, but is now planned to be available for licensed (priority) and unlicensed (general) public use. We believe it is an attractive alternative for medical centers, hotels and resorts, theme parks, multi-family residential developments, transportation hubs, universities and other campus-based enterprises, and industrial businesses that are seeking their own private cellular network to intelligently and securely connect, manage, control, and analyze increasingly complex and critical operations.
Our IBW solutions include:
•DAS Conditioners (Commercial Market) - These units attenuate the high-powered radio frequency (RF) source from base transceiver system (BTS) to lower-powered RF required for the DAS. We offer both passive and active DAS conditioners, both of which can accommodate the majority of North American wireless service provider's frequency bands, with numerous port configuration options. Our active DAS conditioner, the Universal DAS Interface Unit (UDIT), is also a remotely manageable, high density, space saving unit with additional advanced features like spectrum analysis and tone generators to help test and analyze RF signal measurement data.
•Repeaters (Commercial Market) - These units provide a means to amplify and appropriately filter the RF signal from a cell site, providing the additional power and improved signal to noise performance necessary to optimize wireless service seamlessly throughout a building or structure.
•Repeaters (Public Safety Market) - For the past two years, we have also been offering repeaters specifically for the public safety market. While these products perform essentially the same function as commercial repeaters, they are dedicated only to public safety frequency bands that are distinct from commercial service, and meet the strict National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) regulatory requirements.
•Battery Backup Unit (Public Safety Market) - During fiscal year 2018, we introduced our NFPA-compliant battery backup unit. NFPA requires up to twenty-four hours of battery backup for public safety equipment, such as repeaters. Broadening our product portfolio is an important step toward our goal of offering a comprehensive solution for the in-building public safety market.
•Passive RF System Components and Antennas (Commercial and Public Safety Markets) - We offer a variety of passive system components (couplers, duplexers, splitters, filters, and tappers) for use in both commercial and public safety in-building wireless systems to direct and condition energy flow for specific frequency bands. We also offer a broad line of donor and coverage antennas to support in-building wireless communication.
•OnGo Small Cell (Private LTE Market) - Westell and ip.access are partnering to develop and market an OnGo Small Cell solution targeted to the private LTE market. Westell’s OnGo Small Cell is designed to be a carrier-grade solution that features increased range, robust throughput, and quality of service for voice and data via a single, high-performance unit.

Intelligent Site Management (ISM)
Communication service providers and neutral host operators want to maintain a healthy site infrastructure and monitor at remote unmanned locations at reduced operating expense, including automating/centralizing routine and preventative maintenance, consolidating alarm collection and reporting, and performing remote diagnostics and dispatch. Additionally, it is expected that the growing need for network densification to manage higher capacity and faster speeds at the edge of communication networks will increase the importance of remote monitoring and greater intelligence to support edge infrastructure, such as environmental controls, power systems, and security.
Our ISM solutions provide M2M communication, enabling operators to remotely monitor, manage, and control critical infrastructure and ensure the continued health and success of the network. The four important areas of focus include:
•Environmental management - heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) monitoring/energy monitoring/control, environmental monitoring, and aircraft warning light (AWL) management.
•Power management - AC and DC power monitoring, AWL management, battery monitoring, fuel monitoring, generator management, hybrid power management, rectifier monitoring, and tenant power monitoring.
•Security management - access management, asset tampering, and surveillance management.
•Communications management - microwave, DAS, and small cell management. 
Our ISM solution features the Westell Remote suite of products and the Optima management system for a complete view and understanding of site assets remotely (i.e., without a site visit). This enables the ability to more cost-effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and correct problems with network infrastructure before outages affecting service occur. 
Our solutions reduce network operating expenses; improve network performance, including quality, reliability, and availability; and improve site security.
Communication Network Solutions (CNS)
Building a communications network that can sustain harsh environmental conditions, while providing the required reliability to keep customers happy, can be a challenge, especially while trying to minimize costs. Whether it’s an industrial, utility, transportation, or telecommunications network, the connections between devices must effectively, efficiently, and safely carry and process signals throughout the infrastructure (cables, racks, enclosures, power distribution, etc.) while providing remote management capabilities.
Our CNS segment provides a comprehensive range of solutions to connect nearly any outdoor building or facility, including:
•Integrated Cabinets - Includes outdoor cabinets for sheltering and protecting equipment and maintaining proper operating temperature, enclosures for protecting equipment, and a “one-stop shop” for complete turnkey solutions of customer-specified equipment integrated and installed in the Company’s cabinet.
•Power Distribution Panels - Includes temperature-hardened fuse panels and breaker panels for installation in equipment racks to connect up to bulk power circuits and distribute power to other equipment via individual power feeds.
•Copper/Fiber Network Connectivity - A flexible portfolio of standard relay rack mount panels and wall mount enclosures for Ethernet, fiber, or coax cables to facilitate easy and simple splicing, terminations, or handoffs.
•T1 NIUs - Includes network interface devices with performance monitoring features, line repeaters, and protection panels.
•TMAs - outdoor hardened units mounted on cell towers, enabling wireless service providers to optimize the overall performance of a cell site, including increasing data throughput and reducing dropped connections.
In fiscal year 2019, CNS began developing a suite of fiber access solutions to address the growing customer needs for higher capacity broadband services and future 5G networks. This requires the extension of fiber optic cabling to the network’s edge where end-users connect (i.e., network densification). Service providers and network operators are looking for solutions that can efficiently extend fiber to the edge at lower deployment costs, enabling network densification, technology coexistence, and convergence of data centers with central offices. Our initial fiber access solutions included compact plug-and-play devices to accommodate ruggedized, low-profile fiber optic cable for fast, low-cost deployment, including a suite of specialized modular cassettes, collapsible reeling systems, and fan-out and other pre-terminated assemblies for deployment in central office, outside plant, and customer premise environments.

Customers
The Company's principal customers include communications service providers, systems integrators, neutral host operators, and distributors. Service providers include wireless and wireline carriers, cable or multiple systems operators (MSOs), and Internet service providers (ISPs). 
Continuous industry consolidation among North American (U.S. and Canada) service providers continues to reduce the number of customers for our products and solutions. As a result, the Company depends on fewer, but larger customers for the majority of its revenues. The Company’s largest two customers, Verizon, and AT&T accounted for 23.1% and 11.4%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2019.
Customers outside North America (U.S. and Canada), which are primarily located in Australia, Latin America (includes Mexico), and South Africa, represented an aggregate total of approximately $4.1 million and $5.4 million of the Company’s revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represents approximately 9.3% and 9.2% of the Company's total revenues in such years.
Sales and Customer Support
We sell our products and solutions through our field sales organization, distributors, and partners. Customer contracts are primarily pricing and technical specification agreements that detail the commercial terms and conditions for sales. These agreements typically do not obligate the customer to a specific volume of purchases over time. The agreements may require the Company to accept returns of products within certain time limits, or indemnify customers against certain liabilities arising out of the use of the Company's products and solutions. If these claims or returns are significant, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.
Often, customers require vendor approval before deployment of products and solutions in their networks. Evaluation can take as little as a few months for products, but often longer for new products, solutions, and technologies. Accordingly, the Company is continually submitting successive generations of its current products and solutions, as well as new offerings, to its customers for approval.
We provide customer support, technical consulting, research assistance and training to some of our customers with respect to the installation, operation, and maintenance of our products.
Most of our products and solutions carry a limited warranty ranging from one to seven years, which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet published specifications, but excludes damages caused by improper use. In the event there are material deficiencies or defects in our design or manufacture, the affected products and solutions could be subject to recall.
Supply Chain
With the exception of power distribution panels, which are manufactured in-house, we outsource manufacturing to both domestic and international contract manufacturers (CMs). Some products, such as integrated cabinets, TMAs, remotes, and public safety products, undergo final top-level assembly and testing at our Aurora, Illinois facility. Within the IBW segment, UDIT and commercial repeaters are fully outsourced, including final top-level assembly and testing, at a CM located in Tilton, New Hampshire. Within the ISM segment, remotes are manufactured at another CM located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. In fiscal year 2019, our spending at our two largest CMs by dollar value were $6.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively. 
Reliance on third-party CMs involves risks. Standard commercial components available from multiple suppliers are procured by the CMs. In some cases, where there are single-sourced components and technology needed, we have direct supplier relationships and contracts for these items, and may maintain inventory for these items at the CMs locations. Critical components, technology shortages, or business interruptions at our CMs could cause delays that may result in expediting costs or delayed or lost business.
A substantial portion of the Company's shipments in any fiscal period can relate to orders received in that period. Further, a significant percentage of orders may require delivery within forty-eight hours. To meet this demand, we maintain inventory at our own facilities and at the CMs. Because of rapid technological changes, we face recurring risks that our inventory may become obsolete.
Research and Development
We believe our ability to maintain technological capabilities through enhancements of existing offerings and development of new products and solutions that meet market demands and customer needs is a critical component for success. We therefore

expect to continue to devote resources to research and development (R&D). In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company's R&D expenses were approximately $6.8 million and $7.4 million, respectively.
The Company's R&D personnel are organized by segment, with each business responsible for sustaining technical support of existing products and solutions, conceiving new products in cooperation with other functions within the Company, and adapting standard products or technologies to meet new market demands and customer needs. Additionally, in an effort to remain a highly valued, superior quality, long-term supplier, each segment is charged with reducing product costs for each succeeding generation of products without compromising functionality or serviceability. The teams leverage the Company’s relationships with its CMs and suppliers to achieve these cost reduction objectives.
Our quality systems and product development processes are registered to ISO9001:2008 International Quality System Standard and TL9000, which is the Telecommunication Industry's sector-specific version of the ISO9001:2008. Many current critical processes required for managing the full product life cycle are already in place. Analysis of process and product performance, as well as monitoring of customer satisfaction and perception of products and performance, are routinely reviewed and corrective actions are taken where applicable. We successfully maintain TUV CE registration through quarterly audits in support of critical customer product offerings. Product realization is accomplished as required in the ISO 9001:2008 standard. Critical quality assurance processes such as calibration, control of nonconforming material, supplier evaluation and monitoring, and configuration management are all in place and audited routinely to ensure the best product offerings possible to the customer. We believe product quality and reliability are critical and distinguishing factors in a customer’s product selection process.
The Company’s products are subject to industry-wide standardization organizations, including Telcordia, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Metro Ethernet Forum, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the U.S. and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
Competition
We operate in an intensely competitive marketplace and have no reason to believe that this competitive environment will ease in the future. Our customers base their purchasing decisions on multiple factors including features, quality, performance, price, total cost of ownership, reliability, responsiveness, incumbency, financial stability, reputation, and customer service. While competitors vary by market, some of our primary competitors include ADRF, Asentria, Bird Technologies, C Squared, CCI, Cobham, Charles Industries, Comba, CommScope, Corning, DPS Telecom, Emerson, Errigal, Galooli, Inala, Invendis, ISCO, JMA, Kaelus, Microlab, Purcell, RF Industries, SOLiD, Telect, and Trimm. Some of these competitors compete with us across several of our products and solutions, while many are a competitor to a specific product or solution.
Intellectual Property
The Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to protect trade secrets, obtain or license patents, and operate without infringing on the rights of others. We rely on a combination of technical leadership, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, and other intellectual property and protective measures to secure our proprietary know-how. The expiration of any of the patents held by the Company would not have a material impact on the Company. From time to time, the Company expects to seek additional patents related to its R&D activities.
Employees
As of May 1, 2019, the Company had one part-time employee and 126 full-time employees for a total of 127 employees.
