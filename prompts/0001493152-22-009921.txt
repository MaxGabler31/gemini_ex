Recent Developments
 
On March 22, 2022 the Company, CrossMobile Sp zoo, a company formed under the laws of Poland (“CrossMobile”) and the shareholders of CrossMobile (of which our CEO, Giora Rosenzweig, holds 40.67% and George Baumeohl, a director, holds 6.67%, of the issued preferred share capital of CrossMobile), entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company is to purchase 26% of the outstanding common share capital of CrossMobile on a fully diluted basis, in consideration of the issuance by the Company to CrossMobile of 10,000,000,000 restricted shares of Company common stock (the “Initial Investment”). The acquisition is subject to the registration with the Polish Companies Registrar of the shares issuable to the Company in respect of the Initial Investment, as required under local law. Upon the registration of the Company shareholdings in CrossMobnile, the closing of the Initial Investment will be deemed to have occurred and the 10,000,000,000 Company shares of common stock will be issued to CrossMobile. In addition, for 18 months following the date of the Agreement, the Company has the option to purchase additional shares of CrossMobile, such that following such additional purchase, the Company shall hold approximately 51% of CrossMobile’s outstanding share capital on a fully diluted basis. In the event the Company shall choose to exercise the option, the Company shall issue such number of restricted shares of common stock of the Company calculated based on pre-money valuation of CrossMobile as determined by an independent appraiser agreed between the Company and CrossMobile
 
We believe that the acquisition of CrossMobile provides an opportunity in our evolution and provides us with a strong foothold in the European market. CrossMobile is part of a limited group of licensed operators in the EU. CrossMobile is planning to roll-out a comprehensive suite of value-added services for B2B and B2C customers in the telecom industry.
 
With our involvement in CrossMobile, we expect to provide advanced cybersecurity solutions and other next-generation value-added services to CrossMobile’s future product offerings as well the access to the EU market for our CyberSecurity products.
 
CyberSecurity Business
 
Through SG and RNA, we are primarily engaged in data security and analytics and provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and individuals worldwide The Company leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning to deliver innovative solutions in the areas of cybersecurity, safety focusing on the areas of endpoint security, endpoint management and encryption.
 
As the digital transformation of enterprises continues to advance, workforces are becoming more dispersed and mobile, and data and applications are increasingly migrating to the cloud. As part of this trend, the number of connected endpoints is growing rapidly, as is their complexity and the volume of data that they process and store. These endpoints, which include smartphones, laptops, desktops, servers, vehicles, industrial equipment and other connected devices in the Internet of Things (“IoT”), are increasingly a target for cyber adversaries. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the decentralization of the workplace prompting many enterprises to shift to substantially remote and mobile work models. At the same time, the threat environ\ment has become increasingly hostile as the number of adversaries grows and the scale and sophistication of their attacks, increasingly focused on the endpoint, continue to develop.

The landscape of increasing vulnerability has created opportunities for secure communications platforms, endpoint cybersecurity and management solutions, analytic tools and related services that help enterprises and individuals to secure their connected endpoints.
 
Our software specializes in data protection, threat detection and response. Our Product offerings enable enterprises to protect data stored on premises and in the cloud, confidential data belonging to customers, financial records, strategic and product plans and other intellectual property and, on a parental or guardian level, to monitor minor children’s cyber activities.
 
Our product offering, built on proprietary technology, helps enterprises protect data against cyberattacks from both internal and external threats. Our products enable enterprises to analyze data, account activity and user behavior to detect attacks and prevents or limits unauthorized use of sensitive information and prevents potential cyberattacks and limits others by automatically locking down data, allowing access to those who need it. Our products efficiently sustain a secure state with automation and address additional important use cases including data protection, data governance, compliance, data privacy, classification and threat detection and response.
 
Strategy
 
We believe that the technology underlying our product offering is our primary competitive advantage. The strength of our solution is driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed, coupled with how we have combined them into our highly versatile platform. These advantages enable our end users to

● | Prevent trade secret and data leakage 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Protect against hackers 
● | Minimize loss of productivity 
● | Detect embezzlements and thefts 
● | Defend employees from harassments 
● | Prevent talent and client poaching 
● | Avoid human errors 
● | Develop a new level of decision-making ability based on accurate and real-time data. 
● | Assist parents and legal guardians in monitoring their minor children’s’ cyber online activities. 

 
The Company’s go-to-market strategy focuses principally on generating revenue from software, services and licensing. The Company intends to drive revenue growth and to achieve margins that are consistent with those of other enterprise software companies.
 
We intend to sell substantially all of our products and services to distributors and resellers, which will sell to end-user customers, which we refer to in this report as our customers.
 
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact all of society has increased our long-term opportunity to help our customers protect their data and detect threats. Companies around the world now have employees working remotely from potentially vulnerable home networks, accessing critical on-premises data storages and infrastructure through VPNs and sharing information in cloud data stores. We believe this trend is likely to continue in the long-term and that we are striving to capitalize on the opportunity ahead.

The implementation of our strategies is subject to our raising significant cash resources to, of which no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed capital on commercially reasonable terms. As of the date of this report, we have no commitments for any capital raise.
 
Product Offerings
 
Our Product offerings are comprised of two segments, one targeting for commercial enterprises (B2B) and one for the individual users (B2C).
 
B2B Offerings—The B2B Cybersecurity system software development and implementation program focused on innovative solutions for the constantly evolving cyber challenges of businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) and governmental entities.
 
We recently launched OTOGRAPH, our comprehensive cybersecurity and information security system, to enable business enterprises to monitor, analyze and prevent suspicious or harmful behavior on corporate networks and connected devices. The OTOGRAPH is designed to analyze and prevent internal or external abuse or abnormal activity on enterprise devices, such as PCs, mobile phones, servers or any other OS-based IOT device.
 
The rapid transition to open and cloud-based remote workforce has exposed businesses and organizations across the world to higher risks of cyber-attacks and information security breaches. To enable businesses to better protect their data and workflow, we developed a Business Behavioral Analysis (BBA) system that enables business leaders to track all activity from any given location on a one-stop dashboard. Developed over the past two years, OTOGRAPH provides aggregated data and a wide variety of real-time analytics such as real time monitoring of online behavior, applications and system behavior, data breaches, internal and external connections analytics, productivity analysis and psycholinguistic analysis. Corporations and organizations can then use the dashboard to detect suspicious human or device activities that put their company at risk.
 
OTOGRAPH was developed based on a state of the art intelligence technology combined with AI technology that processes and analyzes massive amounts of behavioral and communication data and enables organizations to make real time accurate preventive assessments and decisions to protect company assets and ensure operational efficiency. OTOGRAPH deploys a unique Business Behavioral Analysis (BBA) machine learning software. Behavioral digital data is extracted from all endpoint devices that are connected to the company’s network infrastructure – whether physically, wirelessly or remotely. The data is processed and analyzed to learn and to reveal the unique digital behavioral pattern of the organization as a whole and of every endpoint or individual.
 
OTOGRAPH then sets baselines of normal patterns for each, and constantly searches for anomalies – deviations from those expected patterns. The anomalies are detected automatically and instantly, categorized by their type and generate push alerts which are sent to the business leader’s dashboard and enabling him to respond to the threat.
 
OTOGRAPH is continuously learning and calibrating the normal patterns and their thresholds to minimize the number of false alarms and constantly adapt to the changing needs of organizations in real time.
 
B2C Cybersecurity —The B2C Cybersecurity division targets families concerned with external cyber threats and exposures in addition to monitoring a child’s behavioral patterns that may alert parents to potential tragedies caused by cyber bullying, pedophiles, other predators, and depression.
 
SG’s Parental System offers a comprehensive solution which is designed to enable parents wishing to observe their children’s online and offline behavior to learn if they are accessing inappropriate websites and content and/or to protect them from a range of threats including cyberbullying, pedophiles and other predators and identity theft.
 
The Parental System line is positioned as the “ultimate parental cyber solution”. This system incorporates a range of features enabling parents to view and manage their children’s phones. The key elements of our proprietary solutions include the following: analysis of all incoming and outgoing written data; analysis of all incoming and outgoing audio communication; real time location tracking; environmental surroundings analysis; and cyber activity analysis.

The Parental System has similar features to those of the B2B yet tailored to fit the needs of parents and guardians to protect their children. Such variations focus on online behavioral patterns whether vocally, via SMS or social media platforms. If there is a change in behavior patterns, the product is designed to immediately send the parent or adult guardian an alert. For example, one of the identifiable indicators before suicide is social withdrawal, something which today appears as a significant decrease in text message exchanges. The system categorizes this decrease as a red flag. Moreover, there are certain words and phrases which increase in use prior to suicide which the system will detect these it will put them in the red flag category.
 
While analyzing voice calls based on; tone of speech, lengths of the conversation and the frequency of calls, Parental System Analytics is capable of identifying changes in behavioral patterns and flagging these changes. For example, studies showed that with deteriorating mental health, the frequency of calls decreases and the sentences along with the length of the conversations get shorter. Any such discrepancy in behavior patterns will send a real time alert to the parent or legal guardian, potentially avoiding a tragedy.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We license the vast majority of our products and services thru a global network of resellers and distributors that we refer to as our channel partners. In addition, we maintain a highly trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners in winning customers through product demonstrations and risk assessments. Our channel partners identify potential sales targets, maintain relationships with customers and introduce new products to existing customers. Sales to our channel partners are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive channel partner agreement.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving and enhancing our existing products, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. Use of our products has expanded from data governance into areas such as data security, privacy, accessibility and retention, and we anticipate that customers and innovation will drive functionality into additional areas. We regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones. We conduct substantially all of our research and development activities in Israel, and we believe this provides us with access to world-class engineering talent. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to extend our technological capabilities and grow our business from strategic technological tuck-in acquisitions.
 
Our research and development expense was $489,210 and $497,121 in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We attempt to protect our technology and the related intellectual property under trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, its type and the jurisdiction in which it arises. We currently have no issued patents.
 
We rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, vendors and customers and generally limit internal and external access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and proprietary technology through certain procedural safeguards. We also rely on invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and others, to assign to the Company all inventions developed by such individuals in the course of their engagement with the Company.
 
In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, we license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, we cannot provide assurance that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.

Competition
 
Our main competition in the global parental control software market are McAfee LLC (US), Avanquest (France), Bitdefender (Romania), SaferKid (US), Symantec Corporation (US), Webroot Inc. (US), Content Watch Holdings, Inc. (US), Verizon Communications Inc. (US), Mobicip LLC (US), and Trend Micro Inc. (Japan). These are companies that may have been in the market longer than our company, and/or have a more recognizable name, but our proprietary algorithms are designed to trace behavioral pattern changes in the user as opposed to the machine, thus providing a better understanding of the user.
 
With regards to the B2B product and software available to protect businesses, we believe that our B2B solution is truly unique. Our main known competitor is Checkpoint Systems, yet, our cyber software provides unique protection by analyzing inner company behavioral patterns as well as external, thus aiding our clients to foresee security breaches whether from an internal or external threat.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
Foreign and domestic laws and regulations apply to many aspects of the Company’s business.
 
The Company collects and uses a wide variety of information for various purposes in its business, including to help ensure the integrity of its services and to provide features and functionality to customers. This aspect of the Company’s business is subject to a broad array of evolving privacy and data protection laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation national and state laws within the United States, including the California Privacy Rights Act. These laws impose strict operational requirements and can provide for significant penalties for non-compliance. Elements of these evolving laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, remain unclear and the Company may be required to modify its practices to comply with them in the future.
Employees
 
As of April 10, 2022, we had eight (8) employees, of which six (5) are primarily engaged in research and development and three (3) in administrative positions.

 
Other Corporate Holdings
 
We currently also have the following subsidiaries.
 
FSC Solutions, Inc. On June 26, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with FSC and its shareholders which included Uri Tadelis, our former Chief Executive Officer and Director and our former Directors Chaim J. Lieberman and Gal Levy. The Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2015 which served as the closing date for the acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of FSC in exchange for the issuance of 70 billion shares of our unregistered common stock with the possibility of the issuance of an additional 130 Billion common shares upon FSC meeting certain milestones as outlined in the Agreement. Upon completion of the acquisition of FSC, we intended to employ FSC’s software and trading platform to enter the on-line trading industry. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we determined that FSC did not have control over the trading platform and software we expected to acquire and operate. Please refer to Item 3 of this report.
 
World Health Energy, Inc. World Health Energy, Inc. owns an algae-tech business whose primary focus was the production of algae using their proprietary GB3000 growth system. The system quickly and efficiently grows algae for the production of biofuels and food protein. We also sought to produce and market high-quality, low-cost B100 biodiesel. Though, we believe that the Company has been successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of the GB3000 system on a small-scale the Company has not yet been able to raise the necessary capital to implement their technologies on a commercial scale.
