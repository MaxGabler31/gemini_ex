Competitive Advantages
 
With our first-to-market and technology-driven cryogenic logistics solutions for the life sciences industry, we have established a unique lead over potential competitors. Furthermore, we are not aware of any company that offers comparable solutions and have the same capabilities Cryoport has as a global provider of advanced, validated temperature-controlled logistics solutions. With over a decade as a leading temperature-controlled logistics solutions company serving the life sciences industry, working with our tools in packaging, information technology, and temperature-controlled logistics, we approach our growing market with innovation, creative thinking, and advanced technologies.
 
Most of our competition utilizes “older technologies” and/or systems. In fact, a portion of the biopharma market and much of the animal health market still uses liquid nitrogen or dry ice with no or little validation processes for their equipment or procedures. In the case of dry ice, the technology simply does not achieve low enough temperatures or deliver stable temperatures, which may have standard deviations up to 14℃. Consequently, this medium allows cellular activity to continue and cells to degrade, impacting cell line performance and cell viability. Liquid nitrogen, on the other hand, while effective in holding its temperature, is bulky, heavy, expensive and requires special handling to avoid spillage and accommodate weight. Both dry ice and liquid nitrogen are classified “hazardous” by IATA (International Air Transportation Association) and, therefore, shipping companies and regulatory authorities. Both are also classified as “dangerous goods.” Both these methods are inefficient when compared to Cryoport’s solutions, which are classified as non-hazardous. Cryoport goes beyond traditional ISTA (International Safe Transit Association) packaging validation processes qualification because of the high value and at times irreplaceable commodities that we are counted on to transport. Through our experience, we know logistics distribution can have a large impact on product/ commodity conditions. Our implementation of Quality by Design processes includes the ability to assess in-field events and the impact of logistics on the commodity being shipped and the equipment being used for individual shipments. We think such scrutiny may be included in regulatory requirements in the future.
 
We have been qualified as a trusted temperature-controlled logistics solutions provider for hundreds of life sciences companies and institutions and, currently, support well over 200 clinical trials in the regenerative medicine space. Cryoport has logged over 250,000 shipments to over 100 countries with hundreds of life sciences materials. This experience and reputation, combined with our over a decade of know-how and technology, provides us with significant competitive advantages. In fact, since our inception, we have experienced minimal client attrition.
 
While we look at companies such as Fisher BioServices, AmerisourceBergen and other cold-chain logistics providers as potential competitors, most of these companies are also our clients and/or partners.
 
Our competitive position is further enhanced by our respective “powered by CryoportSM” partnership agreements with FedEx, DHL and UPS, who collectively, account for approximately 85% of world’s air freight and who, respectively, have been expanding other parts of their temperature-controlled offerings for the life sciences industry.

We continuously enhance and broaden our solutions offering in order to maintain and extend what we believe to be a significant lead in the marketplace. We believe that it would take a serious potential competitor an extended period of time to build out the tools, solutions, and competencies we possess along with our know-how.
 
In addition to our intellectual property consisting of multiple issued and pending U.S. patents as well as our lead as the first-to-market mover and leader in market share in the regenerative medicine space, we think our biggest competitive advantage falls into our trade secrets and our speed to market with new solutions, which is powered by our sensitivity to anticipate and reaction to client needs and to market demand. We think that our solutions are innovative and comprehensive. We try to employ the best people in the industry and we foster the development and implementation of new technologies to maintain that lead.
 
We take pride in being a “green” company; we consider it to be a competitive advantage All materials use by Cryoport are recyclable and/or reusable. We take our responsibility toward the environment quite seriously.

Cryoport’s Positioning in the Life Sciences Industry
 
Life sciences technology advancements are expected to have a significant impact on global society over the next 25 years. In the United States alone, the life sciences industry is made up of 6,000 identifiable life science establishments. However, the industry is growing globally, in a way where research and manufacturing pipelines span across the globe. This increases the need to mitigate logistics risk for these cellular based commodities/products.
 
The total cold chain logistics market for the life sciences industry has historically grown much faster per annum than the total life sciences logistics market. For 2017, global cold chain logistics transportation costs, overall, were reported to be $13.4 billion; with approximately $2.7 billion spent within the regenerative medicine space. By 2021, the global life sciences cold chain logistics market is forecast to grow to $16.6 billion for a 24% increase.
 
Contributing drivers to this growth are the recent advancements in the development of biologics and cell-based therapies. As a result, scientists, intermediaries, and manufacturers require means for cryogenically transporting their work and products, such as CAR T-cell therapies, where temperatures must be maintained below the “glass point” (generally, below minus 136° Celsius). At temperatures below the glass point all metabolic activity is halted, which prevents cells changing or degrading while in storage or in transit. Any cell change or degradation could impact the efficacy or safety of a sample or product.
 
In late 2017, we launched our Cryoport Express® Cryoport Certified CoolTM, or “C3TM” logistics solution to support the 2-8° Celsius space. Our Cryoport Express® C3™ solution was specifically developed for the front end of autologous therapies, so it is much more robust, exacting and reliable and, thereby, more expensive than traditional 2° to 8° Celsius shipping solutions. It is supported by the CryoportalTM Logistics Management Platform and the SmartPak IITM Condition Monitoring System giving our clients a seamless logistics record of vital information for each therapy shipped, where applicable.
 
Cryoport’s clients include companies and institutions that require reliable temperature-controlled logistics solutions such as therapy developers for personalized medicine, bio-pharmaceuticals, research, contract research organizations, diagnostic laboratories, contract manufacturers, cord blood repositories, vaccine manufacturers, animal husbandry related companies, and in-vitro fertilization clinics.

The Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform also serves as the communications center for the management, collection and analysis of SmartPak IITM Condition Monitoring System data collected in near real time in the field. Collected data is converted into pre-designed reports containing valuable and often actionable information that becomes the quality control standard or “pedigree” of the shipment. This information can be utilized by Cryoport to provide valuable feedback in near real time to our clients relating to their shipments. Additionally, our SmartPak IITM Condition Monitoring System provides the ability to apply Quality by Design fundamentals to our logistics solutions enabling intervention and risk mitigation capabilities to be employed.
 
The Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform software platform has been developed as a “carrier-agnostic” system, allowing clients and the Cryoport Logistics Management team to work with any combination of integrators, freight forwarders, couriers and/or brokers depending on the specific requirements and/or client preferences. To increase operational efficiencies, the Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform is integrated with the tracking systems of FedEx, DHL and UPS and other key logistics providers.
 
The Cryoportal™ was developed for time-and temperature-sensitive shipments that are required to be maintained at specific temperatures, beginning with the most demanding cryogenic temperatures (minus 150° Celsius) and moving upward to ambient (between 20° and 25° Celsius) to ensure that the shipped samples/commodities/products are not subject to degradation or out of designated “safe” range temperatures. While our current focus is on cryogenic (minus 150℃) as well as 2-8℃ logistics within the life sciences industry, the use of the Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform can and may be extended into other temperature-controlled ranges for the life sciences. To our knowledge, the Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform is unique to temperature-controlled logistics in the life sciences industry. It is robust and has considerable capabilities. We frequently receive favorable feedback about the Cryoportal™.
 
Cryoport Express® Shippers
 
Our Cryoport Express® Shippers are a family of shippers engineered specifically to serve the life sciences industry. Engineering of these devices, which are made up of proprietary packaging, dewar vacuum flasks, real time electronic monitoring systems, requires multiple and varied engineering disciplines. Each Cryoport Express® Shipper is ISTA (International Safe Transit Association) validated and IATA, UN, International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) compliant. Cryoport Express® Shippers are the highest level, most comprehensive logistics shippers serving the life sciences industry.
 
At the core, Cryoport Express® Shippers cryogenic series, we employ liquid nitrogen vapor shipper vacuum flask tanks capable of maintaining cryogenic temperatures of minus 150° Celsius or below for a dynamic shipping period of 10 days or more. A dry vapor cryogenic shipper is a device that uses liquid nitrogen contained inside a vacuum insulated vessel (vacuum flask tank), which serves as a refrigerant to provide stable storage temperatures below minus 150° Celsius. Our Cryoport Express® Shippers are designed to ensure that there is no pressure build up as the liquid nitrogen evaporates. We have developed a proprietary retention system to ensure that liquid nitrogen stays inside the vacuum container, which allows the shipper to be designated as a dry vapor shipper meeting IATA requirements. Biological or pharmaceutical specimens are stored in a specimen chamber, referred to as a “well” inside the container and refrigeration is provided by gas evolving from the liquid nitrogen entrapped within the proprietary retention system. Specimens that may be transported using our cryogenic shipper include: live cells, scientific or pharmaceutical commodities such as cancer therapies, vaccines, diagnostic materials, semen, eggs, embryos, infectious substances, and other commodities that require continuous exposure to cryogenic temperatures, i.e., temperatures below minus 150° Celsius.
 
An important feature of our Cryoport Express® Shippers is their compliance with the stringent packaging requirements of IATA Packing Instructions 602 and 650, respectively. These specifications include meeting internal pressure (hydraulic) and drop performance requirements. Under IATA guidelines, Cryoport Express® Shippers are classified as “Non-hazardous.” Dry ice and liquid nitrogen are classified as “Dangerous Goods.” Our shippers are also in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) regulations that prohibit egress of liquid nitrogen residue from the shipping packages. The ICAO is a United Nations organization that develops regulations for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

We currently offer four sizes of dry vapor shippers, the Cryoport Express® Standard Shipper with a storage capacity of up to 75 2.0 ml vials, the Cryoport Express® High Volume Shipper, which has a storage capacity of up to 500 2.0 ml vials, and the Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper, which has a storage capacity of up to 1,500 2.0 ml vials, and the CryoMax™, which has a capacity of 36,400 2.0 ml vials. Our Cryoport Express® Shippers are composed of an aluminum (aircraft-grade) dewar flask, containing a well for holding the high value biological or other materials in its inner chamber and our proprietary retention foam that absorbs the liquid nitrogen placed in the shipper to provide it with its extreme cold temperature. The dewar flask is vacuum insulated to limit the transmission of heat from outside the flask to the liquid nitrogen captured within the absorption foam and the well.
 
Cryoport Express® Standard Shippers
 
Cryoport Express® Standard Shippers are lightweight, low-cost and include re-usable dry vapor liquid nitrogen storage containers (vacuum flask tank) that, we believe, combine the best features of life sciences packaging, cryogenics science and vacuum insulation technology. A Cryoport Express® Standard Shipper is composed of an aluminum metallic dewar flask, with a well for holding the biological material in the inner chamber. The dewar vessel is a device in which the conduction, convection and radiation of heat are reduced as much as possible giving it the capability of maintaining its contents at a near-constant temperature over relatively long periods of time. The inner chamber of the shipper is surrounded by a high surface, low-density material which retains the liquid nitrogen in-situ by absorption, adsorption, and surface tension. Absorption is defined as the taking up of matter in bulk by other matter, as in the dissolving of a gas by a liquid, whereas adsorption is the surface retention of solid, liquid or gas molecules, atoms or ions by a solid or liquid. This material absorbs liquid nitrogen several times faster than currently used materials, while providing the shipper with a hold time and capacity to transport biological materials safely and conveniently. The specimen-holding chamber has a primary cap to enclose the specimens/commodities, and a removable and replaceable secondary cap to further enclose the specimen/commodity-holding container and to contain the liquid nitrogen dry vapor. The entire dewar vessel is then wrapped in a plurality of insulating and cushioning materials and placed in a disposable outer packaging made of recyclable material. The Cryoport Express® Standard Shippers has a storage capacity of up to 75 2.0 ml vials.
Cryoport Express® High Volume Shippers
 
Cryoport Express® High Volume Shipper also uses a dry vapor liquid nitrogen (LN2) technology to maintain minus 150° Celsius temperatures with a dynamic shipping endurance of 10 days or more. The Cryoport Express® High Volume Shipper is based on the same dry vapor technology as Cryoport’s original standard dry shipper and utilizes an absorbent material to hold LN2, thus providing the extended endurance time and IATA validation as a non-hazardous shipping container. The high volume dry shipper is reusable and recyclable, making it a highly sustainable and cost-effective method of transporting life science materials. The Cryoport Express® High Volume Shipper has a storage capacity of up to 500 2.0 ml vials.
Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shippers
 
Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper can be used either as a dry vapor shipper or a liquid shipper. It is designed to focus on vaccine ampoules or cryovial shipments in canisters. In the case of dry vapor liquid nitrogen (LN2), it maintains minus 150°C temperatures with a dynamic shipping endurance of 20 days. In the case of liquid nitrogen (LN2), it maintains minus 150°C temperatures with a shipping endurance of 72 days. The Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper, in dry vapor form, is based on the same technology as Cryoport’s original standard dry shipper and utilizes an absorbent material to hold LN2, thus providing the extended endurance time and IATA validation as a non-hazardous shipping container. The Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper, in liquid form, is a ‘wet’ dewar with all the characteristics attendant to a wet dewar and with a holding time of 72 days. The Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper is reusable and recyclable, making it a highly sustainable and cost-effective method of transporting life science materials. As a point of reference, the Cryoport Express® CXVC1 Shipper has a storage capacity of up to 1,500 2.0 ml vials.

Cryoport Shipper Summary
 
We believe Cryoport Express® Solutions are the most advanced and most cost-effective logistics solutions available in the life sciences industry and satisfy client needs and scientific and regulatory requirements relating to the shipment of time- and temperature-critical, frozen and refrigerated transport of biological materials, such as stem cells, cell lines, pharmaceutical clinical trial samples, gene biotechnology, infectious materials handling, animal and human reproduction markets. Due to our proprietary technology, innovative design and systems, our shippers are less prone to losing critical functional hold time than the competing products.
Cryoport Express® SmartPak II™ Condition Monitoring System
 
Condition monitoring is a high-value feature from our clients’ perspective as it is an effective and reliable method to determine that the shipment materials were not damaged and did not experience degradation during shipment due to temperature fluctuations. Our SmartPak II™ Condition Monitoring System is designed to track the key aspects of each shipment that could affect the quality and/or timing of delivery of the commodity/product to its intended destination. This includes real-time tracking using GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi technologies, monitoring of internal and external temperatures, humidity, pressure, shock, orientation of the shipper, as well as light, as a measure of security breaches, compromised packaging or shipper openings during transit. Our temperature sensors are positioned within our Cryoport Express® Shippers to record the most accurate readings. The resultant temperature mapping includes both the temperature inside the chamber (which is closest to the actual biomaterial) and the external temperature. Our advanced SmartPak II™ Condition Monitoring System is engineered to work in tandem with our Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform, enabling predictive and proactive monitoring of materials shipped. The data collected and resulting analytics, combined with the mapping of shipment check-in points, provide a holistic view of the complete shipping process. At the client’s election, shipments can have a full chain-of-custody and chain-of- condition with data monitoring, analysis, archival storage available for every shipment.
 
Chain-of-Condition and Chain-of-Custody
 
Chain-of-Condition information is essential for many life sciences customers. Our monitoring services are provided by our SmartPak IITM Condition Monitoring System, which provides data on the condition of our Cryoport Express® Shipper and the conditions in which commodities/products are being shipped, which is critical for temperature-sensitive biologics. The Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform acts as the data repository for all shipment and condition information. Our customers can access their information via the Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform through an Internet connection. Chain–of-condition service provided via Cryoport Express® SmartPak Condition Monitoring Systems is available at the client’s election. With the assistance of an overlay on carrier check-ins and our algorithms, our SmartPak IITM Condition Monitoring System supplies a data monitor that reports chain-of-custody information, which is another essential information element required for temperature-sensitive biologics.

Quality by Design Logistics
 
Quality by Design (“QbD”) is a concept that has become mainstream in the pharmaceutical manufacturing space in recent years. QbD is a science and risk-based approach to quality that identifies, measures, and defines the critical processes that impact quality and provides a pathway to introduce quality and risk management into the design process. The process begins with a Target Product Profile (“TPP”) that describes the intended use, safety, and efficacy parameters of the product. Critical Quality Attributes (“CQA’s”) such as equipment hold time, nitrogen evaporation rate (for dry vapor liquid nitrogen shippers), and orientation for example are then identified based on the TPP. By understanding the design space (the sum total of all variability) and control space (the sum total of all acceptable variability) CQA’s can then be utilized to produce a process supporting the TPP providing enhanced process controls. As our Quality Assurance Program continues to evolve, key elements of QbD will be incorporated throughout company processes, making Cryoport unique in the logistics space in its support of its clinical and commercial distribution clients and partners.
 
SafePak and SafePak XL
 
Cryoport provides proprietary biological material holders called SafePak and SafePak XL, which are made up of a containment bag used in connection with the shipment of goods using Cryoport Express® Shippers. For example, up to 75 cryovials (polypropylene vials with high-density polyethylene closures), set on aluminum canes, are placed into the SafePak, which is designed to contain the entire contents of all the vials in the event of leakage or breakage of a vial. . This SafePak is then placed, securely and safely, into the well of the Cryoport Express® Shipper. Both the SafePak and SafePak XL are made of Tyvek and provide a leak proof microbial barrier and reduce risk of any cross contamination.
 
Logistics Expertise, Consulting and Support
 
Cryoport’s client services professionals provide 24/7/365 live logistics and monitoring services with specialized knowledge in the domestic and global logistics of life sciences material requiring controlled temperatures. Cryoport logistics professionals have validated shipping lanes in and out of well over 100 countries to date to ensure shipments maintain temperatures and arrive securely and on time.

The Cryoport Consulting Division addresses the demand created by the worldwide advances in cellular based therapies, including immunotherapies, stem cells and CAR T-cells. Cell-based immunotherapies are driving broad shifts and challenges for the life sciences industry, including how to obtain, properly store and carefully transport the growing number of new, individualized, temperature sensitive therapies. Improper temperature maintenance or temperature excursions during any portion of a logistics cycle can adversely affect the viability of these biologically based commodities. Consequently, strategic, global logistics planning for cryogenic cold chain solutions has taken on a strategic importance to the life sciences industry and a rapidly growing demand for consulting expertise.
 
 Other Development Activities
 
We are continuing our research, engineering and development efforts to further refine our current technology and development of new technology applications as well as explore opportunities with partners to offer complementary packaging solutions for temperature-controlled logistics. We also continue to further expand the functionality of our Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform to ensure a highest level of effectiveness and efficiency in the temperature-controlled logistics process and to allow for intelligent and easy data monitoring and analysis.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and laws of global jurisdictions relating to matters regarding shipments, customs, import, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

The shipping of biologic products, biologic commodities, diagnostic specimens, infectious substances and dangerous goods, whether via air or ground, falls under the jurisdiction of many state, federal and international agencies. The quality of the packaging that protects a product or biologic commodity determines whether or not it will arrive at its destination in a satisfactory condition. Currently the most stringent regulations we are subject to are the dangerous goods regulations. Many of the regulations for transporting dangerous goods in the United States are determined by international rules formulated under the auspices of the United Nations. Dangerous goods are usually one-time shipments and are not a part of our regular recyclable Cryoport Express™ service. When we ship dangerous goods, we follow strict and stringent guidelines.
 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) is the United Nations organization that develops regulations (Technical Instructions) for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. If shipment is by air, compliance with the rules established by International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) is required. IATA is a trade association made up of airlines and air cargo couriers that publishes annual editions of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. These regulations interpret and add to the ICAO Technical Instructions to reflect industry practices. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) has regulations (published in the Code of Federal Regulations) for interstate shipping of specimens.
 
Our Cryoport Express® Shippers meet Packing Instructions 602 and/or 650 and are certified for the shipment of Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods per the requirements of the ICAO Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air and IATA. Our present and planned future versions of the Cryoport SmartPak Condition Monitoring Systems will likely be subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), IATA and possibly other agencies which may be difficult to determine on a global basis.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
Manufacturing. We source components for our Cryoport Express® Shippers from multiple suppliers that are manufactured to our engineering and specifications using our proprietary technology and know-how to mitigate supply chain risks. We also use “of the shelf” products, which we may modify to meet our requirements. For some components, however, there are relatively few alternate sources of supply and the establishment of additional or replacement suppliers may or may not be accomplished immediately. Should this occur, we endeavor to mitigate risk by an increase in our inventory level to cover our total forecasted demand giving us time to further mitigate service risk as we secure additional qualified suppliers. Some of our Cryoport Express® Shippers also use components that were formerly manufactured in-house and that are now outsourced. The central electronic device used in our condition monitoring systems, the Smart Pak IITM, have been acquired from single sources with calibration done by an independent third party.
 
Our vendor/partner relationships allow us to concentrate on further advancing and expanding our cold chain logistics solutions to meet the growing and varied demands for validated temperature-controlled logistics solutions in the life sciences industry market. We think our current supply structure provides us the opportunity to rapidly scale to support our client’s commercialization activities; however, we continue to work to improve our current supply chain and to continue to mitigate risks therein.
 
Raw Materials. Various common raw materials are used in the manufacture of our shippers and in the development of our technologies. These raw materials are generally available from several alternate distributors and manufacturers. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials and, generally, we do not consider raw material availability to be a significant factor in our business.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We currently own four registered U.S. trademarks and have twenty-two additional trademark applications pending in the U.S. and foreign countries. Five of the pending trademarks are filed under the Madrid Protocol and designate Japan, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. Our trademarks generally protect the names of our company, products, and key service brands.
 
We currently own four issued U.S. and foreign patents and three pending U.S. patent applications as described in the table below. These patents and patent applications are generally directed at our shipping containers, parts related thereto, and systems and methods for cryogenic shipping. These issued and pending patents include:
 

Country | Patent/Application No. | Issued 
--------+------------------------+-------------------
U.S. | 6,467,642 | October 22, 2002 
U.S. | 6,119,465 | September 19, 2000
U.S. | 6,539,726 | April 1, 2003 
Japan | JP2002 0554433 | May 18, 2007 
U.S. | 14/589,768 | January 15, 2015 
U.S. | 15/841,170 | December 13, 2017 
U.S. | 15/865,589 | January 9, 2018 

 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies. We intend to file trademark and patent applications covering any newly developed products, methods and technologies. However, there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will be issued as patents or register as trademarks. There can be no guarantee that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or some third party will not initiate an interference proceeding involving any of our pending applications or issued patents. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our issued patents or future issued patents, if any, will provide adequate protection from competition.
 
Patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology. However, the pursuit and assertion of patent rights involve complex legal and factual determinations and, therefore, are characterized by significant uncertainty. In addition, the laws governing patent issuance and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve. Moreover, the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees. As a result, we cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our patent applications, or that any of its issued patents will offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights may not create an effective barrier to competition. We must also pay maintenance fees at set intervals in order for our patents to not expire prematurely. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages, or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely.
 
We may be subject to third parties filing claims that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or whether those claims will hurt our business. If we are forced to defend against such claims, regardless of their merit, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of any such disputes, we may have to develop, at a substantial cost, non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements may be unavailable on terms acceptable to such third parties, or at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.

With respect to our trademarks, we file and pursue trademark registrations on words, symbols, logos, and other source identifiers that consumers use to associate our products and services with us. Although our registered trademarks carry a presumption of validity, they can be challenged and invalidated and as such, we cannot guarantee that any trademark registration is infallible.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties, although, in the past, we have not always obtained such agreements. It is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated or rendered unenforceable, and if so, our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, parties to such agreements may breach confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently discover or invent competitive technologies, or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technology. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate.
 
Customers and Distribution
 
As a result of growing globalization, including such areas as biologics, biopharma, biotechnology, clinical trials, distribution of biopharmaceutical products and reproductive medicine, the requirement for effective and reliable solutions for keeping clinical samples, pharmaceutical products and other specimen at controlled temperatures takes on added significance due to more complex shipping routes, extended shipping times, custom delays and general logistics challenges. Today, many such specimens are traditionally shipped in Styrofoam, cardboard insulated containers packed with dry ice, gel/freezer packs or a combination thereof. The current dry ice solutions have limitations that severely limit their effective use for both short and long-distances (e.g., international). Conventional dry ice shipments often require labor-intensive “re-icing” operations resulting in higher labor and shipping costs.
 
We believe our Cryoport Express® Shippers, our SmartPak II™ Condition Monitoring Systems, the Cryoportal™ Logistics Management Platform and our logistics expertise enable us to be well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for effective and efficient international transport of temperature sensitive life sciences commodities/materials resulting from continued globalization, which is a notable trend within the life sciences and biotechnology industries.
 
We provide domestic shipping solutions in situations where specimens must be kept at controlled temperatures and in regions where there is a high priority placed on maintaining the integrity of materials shipped at these temperatures. This is especially the case for the new therapies being developed in the regenerative medicine market, such as CAR-T cell therapies, that require cryogenic temperatures in order to maintain efficacy.
 
No single customer generated over 10% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 and nine months ended December 31, 2016.
 
Our geographical revenues, by origin, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:
 

Americas | 89.0 | %
--------------------------------------+------+--
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) | 8.1 | %
Asia Pacific (APAC) | 3.0 | %

Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials. Every United States based pharmaceutical company developing a new drug must seek drug development protocol approval by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). These clinical trials are to test the safety and efficacy of the potential new drug/therapy among other things. A significant amount of clinical trial activity is managed by a number of large Clinical Research Organizations (“CROs”).

In connection with the clinical trials, due to globalization, companies can enroll patients from all over the world and may need to regularly submit a blood or other specimen at the local hospital, doctor’s office or laboratory. These samples are then sent to specified testing laboratories, which may be local or in another country. The testing laboratories will typically set the requirements for the storage and shipment of blood specimens. In addition, drugs used by the patients may require frozen shipping to the sites of the clinical trials. While both domestic and international shipping of these specimens may be accomplished using dry ice today, international shipments especially present several problems, as dry ice, under the best of circumstances, can only provide freezing for one to two days in the absence of re-icing (which is quite costly). Because shipments of packages internationally can take longer than one to two days or be delayed due to flight cancellations, incorrect destinations, labor problems, ground logistics, customs delays and safety reasons, dry ice is not always a reliable and/or cost-effective option. Clinical trial specimens are often irreplaceable because each one represents clinical data at a prescribed point in time, in a series of specimens on a given patient, who may be participating in a trial for years. Sample integrity during the shipping process is vital to retaining the maximum number of patients in each trial. Our shippers are ideally suited for this market, as our longer hold time ensures that specimens can be sent over long distances with minimal concern that they will arrive in a condition that will cause their exclusion from the trial. There are also many instances in domestic shipments where Cryoport Express® Shippers will provide higher reliability and be cost effective.
 
Furthermore, the IATA requires that all airborne shipments of laboratory specimens be transmitted in either IATA Instruction 650 or 602 certified packaging. We have developed and obtained IATA certification of our Cryoport Express® System, which is ideally suited for this market, in particular due to the elimination of the cost to return the reusable shipper.
 
Biotechnology and Diagnostic Companies. The biotechnology market includes basic and applied research and development in diverse areas such as stem cells, cloning, gene therapy, DNA tumor vaccines, tissue engineering, genomics, and blood products. Companies participating in the foregoing fields rely on the frozen transport of specimens in connection with their research and development efforts, for which our Cryoport Express® Shippers are ideally suited.
 
Cell Therapy Companies. Rapid advancements are underway in the research and development of cell based therapies, which involve cellular material being injected into a patient. In allogeneic cell therapy, the donor is a different person to the recipient of the cells. Autologous cell therapy is a therapeutic intervention that uses an individual’s cells, which are cultured and expanded outside the body, and reintroduced into the donor. Once cells are processed, in either case, they must be shipped cryogenically for which our Cryoport Express® Shippers are ideally suited.
 
Central Laboratories. With the increase and globalization of clinical studies and trials, logistics has become more complex and ensuring sample integrity has become more challenging. International courier costs are now consuming a significant portion of global protocol budgets. We believe laboratories performing the testing of samples collected during the conduct of these global multi-site studies are looking for reliable state-of-the-art logistics solutions.
 
Pharmaceutical Distribution. The current focus for the Cryoport Express® System also includes the area of pharmaceutical distribution. There are a significant number of therapeutic drugs and vaccines currently or anticipated soon to be undergoing clinical trials. After the FDA approves them for commercial marketing, it will be necessary for the manufacturers to have a reliable and economical method of distribution to the physician who will administer the product to the patient. It is likely that the most efficient and reliable method of distribution will be to ship a single dosage to the administering physician. These drugs are typically identified to individual patients and therefore will require a complete tracking history from the manufacturer to the patient. The most reliable method of doing this is to ship a unit dosage specifically for each patient. If such drugs require maintenance at frozen or cryogenic temperatures, each such shipment will require a frozen or cryogenic shipping package. Cryoport can provide the technology to meet this anticipated need.
 
Distribution of Vaccines and Biologic Therapies. There are a variety of vaccines and other drugs or therapies that require distribution at frozen or cryogenic temperatures. We anticipate significant growth in this area, in particular therapies based upon stem cells. It is likely that the most efficient and reliable method of distribution will be to ship a single dosage or a limited supply to the physician for administration to a patient.

In February 2013, we began providing comprehensive logistics management services for the lead poultry vaccine distribution of Zoetis, Inc. In October 2013, Zoetis engaged us to manage distribution of an additional vaccine.
 
Fertility Clinics and In Vitro Fertilization (“IVF”). Maintaining cryogenic temperatures during shipping and transfer of in vitro fertilization specimens like eggs, sperm, or embryos is critical for cell integrity in order to retain viability, stabilize the cells, and ensure reproducible results and successful IVF treatment. There are approximately 3,300 fertility clinics worldwide. Cryoport anticipates that this market will continue to grow; in the United States alone, in 2016, the total fertility market is reported to have grown to more than $4.0 billion with over 1.3 million women seeking treatment each year. In the worldwide market, it is reported that there are more than one billion IVF cycles per year, growing slightly faster than the total overall population.
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently have a sales and marketing team of fourteen employees led by our Chief Commercial Officer that drive our business development, program management, consulting and marketing activities. Given the global nature of our business, we plan to continue to broaden our sales and marketing reach in the all corners of the world with emphasis on the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. We plan to hire additional sales and marketing personnel globally and implement marketing initiatives intended to increase awareness of the Cryoport and its advanced temperature-controlled solutions serving the life sciences industry.
Industry and Competition
 
Our products and services are sold into a rapidly growing segment of the logistics industry focused on the temperature sensitive packaging and shipping of biological materials. Expenditures for “value added” packaging for frozen transport have been increasing for the past several years and, due in part to the advancements in biology and continued globalization, are expected to continue to increase even more in the future as more domestic and international biotechnology firms introduce pharmaceutical products that require continuous refrigeration at cryogenic temperatures. This principle also applies to the animal health and reproductive medicine markets. We believe these advances will require a greater dependence on passively controlled temperature transport systems (i.e., systems having no external power source). In addition, we expect that industry standards and regulations will be introduced globally, requiring more comprehensive tracking and validation of shipping temperatures.
 
We believe that advancements and growth in the following markets has resulted in the need for increased reliability, efficiencies and greater flexibility in the temperature sensitive segment of the life sciences logistics market:

Cryoport Express™ Shippers (Liquid Nitrogen Dry Vapor) compared to Dry Ice Shipments
 
One problem faced by many companies operating in these specialized markets is the limited number of cryogenic shipping systems serving their needs. The currently adopted protocol and the most common method for packaging frozen transport in these industries is the use of solid-state carbon dioxide (dry ice). Dry ice is and has been used extensively in shipping to maintain a frozen state for a period of one to four days. Although dry ice is used in the transport of many biological products, such as pharmaceuticals, laboratory specimens and certain infectious materials, it does not provide sufficient temperature to stop metabolic activity. The common approach to shipping these items via ground freight is to pack the product in a container, such as an expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) box or a molded polyurethane box, with a variable quantity of dry ice. The box is taped or strapped shut and shipped to its destination with freight charges based on its initial dimensional shipping weight. All dry ice shipping is considered “dangerous goods” shipping, requiring extra packaging steps and adding costs. It also gives off carbon dioxide and sublimates unevenly and in short duration; thereby, creating other environmental problems.
 
With respect to shipments via specialized courier services, there is no standardized method or device currently in use for the purpose of transporting temperature-sensitive frozen biological specimens as courier services simply provide transport or packaging specified. One common method for courier transport of biological materials is to place frozen specimens, refrigerated specimens and/or ambient specimens into a compartmentalized container, similar in size to a 55-quart Coleman or Igloo cooler. The freezer compartment in the container is loaded with a quantity of dry ice, which is at minus 78° Celsius, while the refrigerated compartment at 8° Celsius utilizes ice substitutes.
 
Two manufacturers of the polystyrene and polyurethane containers frequently used in the shipping and courier transport of dry ice frozen specimens are Insulated Shipping Containers, Inc. and Tegrant (formerly SCA Thermosafe). When these containers are used with dry ice, the average sublimation rate (e.g., the rate at which dry ice turns from a solid to a gaseous state) in a container with a 1 1/2 inch wall thickness is slightly less than three pounds per 24 hours. Other existing refrigerant systems employ the use of gel packs and ice substitutes for temperature maintenance. Gels and eutectic solutions (phase changing materials) with a wide range of phasing temperatures have been developed in recent years to meet the needs of products with varying specific temperature control requirements.
 
The use of dry ice and dry ice substitutes, however, regardless of external packaging used, are frequently inadequate because they do not provide low enough storage temperatures and, in the case of dry ice, last for only a few days without re-icing. As a result, companies run the risk of increased costs due to lost specimens and additional shipping charges due to the need to re-ice.

Some of the other disadvantages to using dry ice for shipping or transporting temperature sensitive products are as follows:
 

· | availability of a dry ice source
--+---------------------------------


· | handling and storage of the dry ice
--+------------------------------------


· | cost of the dry ice
--+--------------------


· | compliance with local, state and federal regulations relating to the storage and use of dry ice
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dangerous goods shipping regulations
--+-------------------------------------


· | weight of containers when packed with dry ice
--+----------------------------------------------


· | impact of dry ice sublimation on PH levels of the materials being shipped
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | securing a shipping container with a high enough R-value (which is a measure of thermal resistance) to hold the dry ice and product for the required time period
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | securing a shipping container that meets the requirements of IATA, the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the CDC, and other regulatory agencies
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | emission of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) into the environment, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | release of carbonic acid that may affect commodities being shipped
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Due to the limitations of dry ice, specimens that require frozen shipping are more securely shipped at true cryogenic temperatures using a service such as liquid nitrogen dry vapor shippers (such as Cryoport Express™ Shippers), or liquid nitrogen dewars where the specimen is kept over actual liquid nitrogen. However, liquid nitrogen is classified as “hazardous” by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), must be secured to a pallet and has many other pitfalls, primarily in safety and expense.
 
Cryoport Express™ Shippers (Liquid Nitrogen Dry Vapor) compared to Liquid Nitrogen Dewars/Tanks
 
There are distinct disadvantages when using liquid nitrogen for shipping compared to the dry vapor liquid nitrogen used in Cryoport Express™ Shippers. Liquid nitrogen dewars/tanks are classified as dangerous goods by IATA and cannot be shipped as parcel. In addition, if the dewar used for shipment is returned, the liquid nitrogen must be disposed of prior to returning the dewar/tank to its origin. These issues add additional procedural steps and costs to the shipment. In addition, there is a risk of liquid nitrogen leakage if the dewar/tank tips to the side during transport, which can cause damage, bodily injury and could compromise the specimen being shipped. Due to the use of our proprietary technology, our Cryoport Express™ Shippers are not prone to leakage when on their side or inverted, thereby protecting the integrity of our Cryoport Express™ Shipper’s hold time and being safe for handling and shipping as a parcel or regular freight.
 
While both liquid nitrogen dry vapor and liquid nitrogen shippers provide solutions to the issues encountered when shipping with dry ice, liquid nitrogen shippers have additional draw backs. For example, a liquid nitrogen shipper typically can cost up to $4,000 per unit, which can substantially limit their use for the transport of many common biologics, particularly with respect to small quantities such as is the case when shipments are point of care drug deliveries. Because of the initial cost and limited production of these containers, they are designed to be reusable. However, the cost of returning these containers can be significant, particularly in international markets, because most applications require only one-way shipping. The logistics support of cryogenic shippers requires more sophisticated logistics management and discipline to ensure shippers are returned and recycled, especially for international shipments, which many companies do not have in place.

Within our intended biotechnology and life sciences markets for Cryoport Express® Shippers, there is limited known direct competition. We compete with liquid nitrogen and dry ice solutions effectively byuse of the improved and integrated hardware and software technology in our products including our comprehensive logistics management software and through the use of our service enabled business model. The Cryoport Express® Solution provides a simple and cost-effective solution for the frozen or cryogenic transport of biotech and life sciences materials. The CryoportalTM assists with the management, scheduling and shipping of the Cryoport Express® Shippers, removing the burdens associated with other methods.
 
Traditional dry ice shippers and liquid nitrogen tank suppliers, such as MVE/Chart Industries, Worthington Industries’ CryoScience by Taylor Wharton, and Air Liquide, offer various models of dry vapor liquid nitrogen shippers that are not as cost efficient for multi-use and multi-shipment purposes due to their significantly greater unit costs and unit weight (which may substantially increase the shipping cost). On the other hand, they are more established and have larger organizations and have greater financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, have a broader manufactured product offering of other liquid nitrogen products and more experience in research and development than we do.
 
Factors that we believe give us a competitive advantage are attributable to our management systems, software and shipping containers, which allow our shipper to retain liquid nitrogen when placed in non-upright positions, the overall “leak-proofness” of our package which determines compliance with shipping regulations, the overall weight and volume of the package which determines shipping costs, and our business model represented by the merged integration of our shipper with CryoportalTM and SmartPak™ II Condition Monitoring System into a seamless shipping, tracking and monitoring solution.
 
Other companies that offer potentially competitive products include Industrial Insulation Systems, which offers cryogenic transport units and has partnered with Marathon Products Inc., a manufacturer and global supplier of wireless temperature data collecting devices used for documenting environmentally sensitive products through the cold chain, and Kodiak Thermal Technologies, Inc. which offers, among other containers, a repeat use active-cool container that uses free piston stirling cycle technology. While not having their own shipping devices, BioStorage Technologies is potentially a competitive company through their management services offered for cold-chain logistics and long-term biomaterial storage. Cryogena offers a single use disposable LN2 shipper with better performance than dry ice, but it does not perform as well and is not as cost-effective as the Cryoport solution when all costs are considered. In addition, BioMatrica, Inc. is developing and offering technology that stabilizes biological samples and research materials at room temperature. They presently offer these technologies primarily to research and academic institutions; however, their technology may eventually enter the broader cold-chain market. Fisher BioServices, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, provides cell therapy logistics services, maintaining cold chain from manufacturer to patient bedside.  They provide customized solutions in bio specimen collection kits, bio specimen shipping, lab processing, biobanking and clinical trial support services.
 
Engineering and Development
 
Our research, development and engineering efforts are focused on continually investigating new technologies that can improve our services and improving the features of our Cryoport Express® Solutions, which includes our cloud-based CryoportalTM, Cryoport Express® Shippers, secondary packaging solutions and our SmartPak II™ Condition Monitoring System. These efforts are expected to lead to the introduction of additional features, including shippers of varying sizes and for various temperature ranges, based on market requirements, further advanced informatics and improved monitoring systems. We are continuously researching alternative and new technologies, lower cost materials, utilization of higher volume assembly methods, enabling technologies, etc. that will make it practical to provide a wider range of Cryoport Express™ Solutions.
 
Alternative technologies to liquid nitrogen in dry vapor form, alternative materials and/or new information and communication technologies may be used to expand our potential market for our Cryoport Express™ Solutions. Our engineering and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2 million and $598,100, respectively, with a large portion being spent on software.

Cryoport’s Quality Assurance Program
 
Cryoport’s Quality System was established using ISO 9001:2008 (Quality management systems – Requirements) as a foundation, along with a structure of procedures and instructions based upon strong operational practices of checks and balances. This system ensures proper controls from the initial contract, through processing and shipping, to proper monitoring and data collection, to successful completion of the order.
 
As Cryoport continues to grow, the overall Quality Management System is being transitioned to ISO 9001:2015. In addition, the Quality Management System will be enhanced and integrated with GxP elements (i.e. Good Distribution Practices) that are applicable to Cold Chain Logistics, to meet and/or exceed customer requirements.
 
This revised system will further integrate additional elements of Cryoport’s Business Processes, Risk Management, Design Controls, and Leadership Commitment to the quality management system.
 
Employees
 
The efforts of our employees are critical to our success. We believe that we have assembled a strong management team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy. We anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our growth strategy. As of March 1, 2018, we had fifty-seven employees and consultants: forty-six full-time, one part-time, seven temporary and three consultants.
Corporate History and Structure
 
We are a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name G.T.5-Limited (“GT5”) on May 25, 1990. In connection with a Share Exchange Agreement, on March 15, 2005 we changed our name to Cryoport, Inc. and acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cryoport Systems, Inc., a California corporation, in exchange for 200,901 shares of our common stock (which represented approximately 81% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock following the close of the transaction). Cryoport Systems, Inc., which was originally formed in 1999 as a California limited liability company, and subsequently reorganized into a California corporation on December 11, 2000, remains the operating company under Cryoport, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 17305 Daimler Street, Irvine, CA 92614. The telephone number of our principal executive offices is (949) 470-2300, and our main corporate website is www.cryoport.com. The information on or that can be accessed through our website is not part of this Form 10-K.
 
The Company became public by a reverse merger with a shell company in May 2005. Over time the Company has transitioned from being a development company to a fully operational public company, providing temperature-controlled logistics solutions to the life sciences industry globally.
