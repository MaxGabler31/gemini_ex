 (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts, average realized prices, and average cost amounts)
 The Company
 Alcoa Corporation, a Delaware corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation (the Separation Transaction) from its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. “Regular-way” trading of Alcoa Corporation’s common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 1, 2016 under the ticker symbol “AA.” Alcoa Corporation’s common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share. Alcoa Corporation’s principal executive office is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Alcoa,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alcoa Corporation and all subsidiaries consolidated for the purposes of its financial statements.
 References herein to “ParentCo” refer to Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries through October 31, 2016, at which time it was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic) and since has been subsequently renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. 
 Alcoa Upstream Corporation was formed in Delaware in March 2016 and was renamed Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction. Alcoa Corporation entered into certain agreements with ParentCo to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies to govern the relationship and allocation of various assets, liabilities, and obligations between Alcoa Corporation and ParentCo after the completion of the Separation Transaction. 
 Alcoa is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. Alcoa has direct and indirect ownership of 28 operating locations across nine countries. The Company’s operations comprise three reportable business segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. The Bauxite and Alumina segments primarily consist of a series of affiliated operating entities held in Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, a global, unincorporated joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited (described below). The Aluminum segment consists of the Company’s aluminum smelting and casting along with the majority of the energy production business. 
 Aluminum, as an element, is abundant in the earth’s crust, but a multi-step process is required to make aluminum metal. Aluminum metal is produced by refining alumina oxide from bauxite into alumina, which is then smelted into aluminum and can be cast and rolled into many shapes and forms. Aluminum is a commodity traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Alumina, an intermediary product, is subject to market pricing through alumina price indices published by third-party price reporting firms such as CRU Metallurgical Grade Alumina Price, Platts Metals Daily Alumina PAX Price, and FastMarkets Metal Bulletin Non-Ferrous Metals Alumina Index (collectively, the Alumina Price Index (API)). As a result, the prices of both aluminum and alumina are subject to significant volatility and, therefore, influence the operating results of Alcoa. 
 Business Strategy
 The Company has a goal to innovate and create low-carbon solutions. The Company has a comprehensive portfolio of products manufactured through low-carbon emitting processes (SustanaTM brand) and future-oriented research and development projects focused on reducing carbon output. 
 The Company offers a comprehensive portfolio of products manufactured through low-carbon emitting processes in its SustanaTM family of products, including EcoDuraTM aluminum, EcoLumTM aluminum, and EcoSourceTM alumina.
 Further, Alcoa has established a technology roadmap of research and development projects that have the potential to drive value by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions in both alumina refining and aluminum smelting. The roadmap includes: 
  
• | Our Refinery of the Future project, which aims to achieve zero-carbon alumina refining through the use of various processes and new technologies that we are undertaking to adapt to alumina refining, such as mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) and electric calcination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our ELYSISTM joint venture, which uses carbon-free aluminum smelting technology to eliminate all greenhouse gases in smelting production and produce pure oxygen as a byproduct.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our ASTRAEATM process, which is a proprietary technology that can purify post-consumer aluminum scrap, regardless of alloy combination, and beneficiate it up to high purity levels that could permit its use in high tolerance applications, such as aerospace.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Alcoa earned the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certification for 15 operating sites and continues to pursue additional certifications from ASI, the aluminum industry’s most comprehensive third-party program to validate responsible production practices. The Company has also earned ASI’s Chain of Custody certification, which allows Alcoa to market globally ASI-certified bauxite, alumina, and aluminum.

In 2021, the Company made significant progress on its strategic objectives, announced in October 2019, to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability. The announced objectives included the sale of non-core assets over the following twelve to eighteen month period with the goal of generating cash proceeds of $500 to $1,000 and realignment of the operating portfolio over the following five years through a review of 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 million metric tons of refining capacity.
 In the first quarter 2021, the Company reached its target to generate between $500 and $1,000 from non-core asset sales by completing the divestiture of the rolling mill business at the Company’s Warrick operations in a transaction valued at $670. Additionally in 2021, the Company completed two other significant non-core asset sales of the former Eastalco and Rockdale smelter sites in Maryland and Texas, respectively. Net cash proceeds from asset sales totaled $966 million in 2021.
 In 2021, Alcoa made significant progress on its smelting portfolio review reaching approximately 75 percent of its target to improve, curtail, close, or divest 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity within the five-year program ending in 2024. After the portfolio transformation, the Company has the goal of being the lowest emitter of carbon dioxide among all global aluminum companies, per ton of emissions in both smelting and refining, and aims to move its aluminum portfolio to a first quartile cost position. In addition, Alcoa anticipates that up to 85 percent of its smelting portfolio will be powered by renewable energy, building upon the Company’s existing sustainability profile and in support of its strategic priority to “advance sustainably.”
 The Company continues to review the 4 million metric tons of alumina refining capacity which is also part of the five-year program. Although no actions were announced in 2021, the Company has completed approximately 58% of the alumina refining capacity review.

Exclusivity
 Under the terms of their joint venture agreements, Alcoa and Alumina Limited have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, AWAC is their exclusive vehicle for their investments, operations or participation in the bauxite and alumina business, and they will not compete with AWAC in those businesses. In the event of a change of control of either Alcoa or Alumina Limited, this exclusivity and non-compete restriction will terminate, and the partners will then have opportunities to unilaterally pursue bauxite or alumina projects outside of or within AWAC, subject to certain conditions provided in the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategic Council.
Equity Calls
 The cash flow of AWAC and borrowings are the preferred sources of funding for the needs of AWAC. An equity call can be made on 30 days’ notice, subject to certain limitations, in the event the aggregate annual capital budget of AWAC requires an equity contribution from Alcoa and Alumina Limited.
Dividend Policy
 AWAC will generally be required to distribute at least 50% of the prior calendar quarter’s net income of each AWAC entity, and certain AWAC entities will also be required to pay a distribution every three months equal to the amount of available cash above specified thresholds and subject to the forecast cash needs of the AWAC entity. 
Leveraging Policy
 Debt of AWAC is subject to a limit of 30% of total capital (defined as the sum of debt (net of cash) plus any minority interest plus shareholder equity). The AWAC joint venture has raised a limited amount of debt to fund growth projects as permitted under Alcoa’s revolving credit line and in accordance with the joint venture partnership agreements. 
Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
 In December 2009, Alcoa entered into a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden), which was formed by the government of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and create a fully integrated aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Ma’aden is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). The complex includes a bauxite mine with estimated capacity of 4 million dry metric tons per year; an alumina refinery with a capacity of 1.8 million metric tons per year (mtpy); an aluminum smelter with a capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 804,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with a capacity of 460,000 mtpy. 
 The joint venture is currently comprised of two entities: the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (MBAC) and the Ma’aden Aluminium Company (MAC). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the MBAC and MAC joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in MAC, which holds the smelter; AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in MBAC, which holds the mine and refinery. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The refinery and smelter are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of Saudi Arabia. 
 Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation have put and call options, respectively, whereby Ma’aden can require Alcoa Corporation to purchase from Ma’aden, or Alcoa Corporation can require Ma’aden to sell to Alcoa Corporation, a 14.9% interest in MBAC and MAC at the then fair market value. These options, if exercised, must be exercised for the full 14.9% interest in both entities. The amended joint venture agreement defines October 1, 2021 as the date after which Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation can exercise their put and call options, respectively, for a period of six months. To date, neither party has exercised their respective put or call options.
 The amended joint venture agreement also defines October 1, 2021 as the date after which Alcoa is permitted to sell all of its shares in both MBAC and MAC collectively, for which Ma’aden has a right of first refusal. Prior to this date, Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation could not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, pledge, or encumber any interests in the joint venture. Under the amended joint venture agreement, upon the occurrence of an unremedied event of default by Alcoa, Ma’aden may purchase, or, upon the occurrence of an unremedied event of default by Ma’aden, Alcoa may sell, its interest in the joint venture for consideration that varies depending on the time of the default.
 ELYSISTM
 ELYSISTM Limited Partnership (ELYSISTM) is a joint venture between the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alcoa (48.235%) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (Rio Tinto) (48.235%), respectively, and Investissement Québec (3.53%), a company wholly-owned by the Government of Québec, Canada. The purpose of the ELYSISTM joint venture is to advance larger scale development and commercialization of its patent-protected technology that produces oxygen and eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional aluminum smelting process. Alcoa invented the inert anode technology for aluminum smelting that serves as the basis for the ELYSISTM joint venture. Batches of carbon-free aluminum produced by ELYSISTM have been sold for use by such companies as Apple Inc. and Audi AG, as the joint venture continues working toward an industrial scale with a technology package planned for sale from 2024.

Manicouagan owns and operates the 335 megawatt McCormick hydroelectric project, which is located on the Manicouagan River in the Province of Québec, Canada. Alcoa owns 40% of the joint venture.
 Bauxite
 This segment consists of the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. Bauxite is the principal raw material used to produce alumina and contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Bauxite is refined using the Bayer process, the principal industrial chemical process for refining bauxite to produce alumina, a compound of aluminum and oxygen that is the raw material used by smelters to produce aluminum metal. Bauxite is Alcoa’s basic raw material input for its alumina refining process. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources. including those belonging to AWAC, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported on a zero-moisture basis in millions of dry metric tons (mdmt) unless otherwise stated. 
 Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina and sells the remainder to third parties. In 2021, Alcoa-operated mines produced 40.9 mdmt of bauxite and mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa, including AWAC, has equity interests produced 6.7 mdmt of bauxite on a proportional equity basis, for a total Company bauxite production of 47.6 mdmt.
 Based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, the amount of bauxite AWAC purchases from its minority-owned joint ventures MRN and CBG differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore, in 2021, Alcoa had access to 48.1 million dmt of 
 4


production from its portfolio of bauxite interests and sold 5.7 million dmt of bauxite to third parties; 42.4 million dmt of bauxite was delivered to Alcoa refineries.
 Information regarding the Company’s bauxite mining properties and bauxite mineral resources and reserves is included in Part 1 Item 2 of this Form 10-K.
 Alumina
 This segment consists of the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. Alcoa’s alumina sales are made to customers globally and are typically priced by reference to published spot market prices. The Company’s largest customer for smelter grade alumina is its own aluminum smelters, which in 2021 accounted for approximately 33% of its total alumina shipments. A small portion of the alumina is sold to third-party customers who process it into industrial chemical products. This segment also includes AWAC’s 25.1% share of MBAC.
 The Company primarily sells alumina through fixed price spot sales and contracts containing two pricing components: (1) the API price basis, and (2) a negotiated adjustment basis that takes into account various factors, including freight, quality, customer location, and market conditions. In 2021, approximately 95% of the Company’s smelter grade alumina shipments to third parties were sold on a fixed price spot basis or adjusted API price basis. 
 Alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity stated in metric tons per year (mtpy) are shown in the following table:

Alcoa Corporation Consolidated Capacity represents our share of production from these facilities. For facilities wholly-owned by AWAC, Alcoa takes 100% of the production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2021, Alcoa had approximately 214,000 mtpy of idle capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 13,843,000 mtpy. The 214,000 mtpy of idle capacity is at the Poços de Caldas facility as a result of the full curtailment of the Poços de Caldas smelter.
 In October 2019, the Company announced a five-year review of our production assets that includes a range of potential outcomes for these facilities, including significantly improved competitive positioning, curtailment, closure, or divestiture. The review includes 4 million metric tons of global refining capacity, of which 2,305,000 mtpy of capacity has been permanently closed since the announced review.
 Aluminum
 This segment currently consists of (i) the Company’s worldwide smelting and casthouse system and (ii) a portfolio of energy assets in Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations into either common alloy ingot (e.g., t-bar, sow, standard ingot) or into value-add ingot products (e.g., foundry, billet, rod, and slab). The energy assets supply power to external customers in Brazil and the United States, as well as internal customers in the Aluminum segment (Baie-Comeau (Canada) smelter and Warrick (Indiana) smelter) and, to a lesser extent, the 
 5


Alumina segment (Brazilian refineries). This segment also includes Alcoa’s 25.1% share of MAC, the smelting joint venture company in Saudi Arabia.
 Smelting and Casting Operations
 Contracts for primary aluminum vary widely in duration, from multi-year supply contracts to spot purchases. Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the published LME aluminum price for commodity grade P1020 aluminum, (ii) the published regional premium applicable to the delivery locale, and (iii) a negotiated product premium that accounts for factors such as shape and alloy. 
 Alcoa’s primary aluminum facilities and its global smelting capacity stated in metric tons per year (mtpy) are shown in the following table:

The Poços de Caldas facility is a casthouse and does not include a smelter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company’s five-year review of our production assets first announced in October 2019 includes 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity. The portfolio review includes evaluations for significant improvements, curtailments, closures, or divestitures. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 685,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 2,962,000 mtpy. The idle capacity includes the capacity at the fully curtailed Intalco smelter, 108,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity at the Warrick smelter, 30,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Portland smelter, and 268,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity at the Alumar smelter. In December 2021, the Company closed 146,000 mtpy of smelting capacity at the Wenatchee smelter in the State of Washington, all of which had been previously idled.
 On December 29, 2021, the Company and the workers’ representatives at the San Ciprián, Spain aluminum plant reached an agreement that calls for the two-year curtailment of the smelter’s 228,000 mtpy, which was completed in January 2022, and a commitment by the Company to initiate the restart of capacity at the smelter in January 2024.  
 In 2021, the Company announced the restart of its 268,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, which is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter 2022. The Company also announced that the Portland Aluminium joint venture in 
 6


Australia plans to restart 35,000 mtpy of curtailed capacity at the Portland aluminum smelter (19,000 mtpy Alcoa share). Once the restart is complete in 2022, the Company will have approximately 186,000 mtpy of its consolidated capacity at Portland operating.
 Including the actions described above, the Company has reviewed approximately 75 percent of the 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity in its portfolio review.
 The Aluminum segment previously held the Company’s rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana. On March 31, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the rolling mill operations to Kaiser Aluminum Corporation for total consideration of approximately $670, which included the assumption of $69 in OPEB liabilities (as adjusted post-closing). With the sale, the Company no longer maintains a rolled products business. 
 See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note C and D to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Energy Facilities and Sources
 Energy comprises approximately 27% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power comprises approximately 31% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs.
 Electricity markets are regional and are limited in size by physical and regulatory constraints, including the physical inability to transport electricity efficiently over long distances, the design of the electric grid, including interconnections, and the regulatory structure imposed by various federal and state entities.
 Electricity contracts may be short-term (real-time or day ahead) or years in duration, and contracts can be executed for immediate delivery or years in advance. Pricing may be fixed, indexed to an underlying fuel source or other index such as LME, cost-based or based on regional market pricing. In 2021, Alcoa generated approximately 10% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchased the remainder under long-term arrangements.
 The following table sets forth the electricity generation capacity and 2021 generation of facilities in which Alcoa Corporation has an ownership interest. See also the Joint Ventures section above.
 
 
Country | Facility | Alcoa Corporation Consolidated Capacity (MW) | | 2021 Generation (MWh)
--------------+----------------+----------------------------------------------+-------+----------------------
Brazil | Barra Grande | | 152 | | 903,664 
 | Estreito | | 157 | | 1,158,451
 | Machadinho | | 119 | | 855,289 
 | Serra do Facão | | 60 | | 169,898 
Canada | Manicouagan | | 133 | | 1,160,441
United States | Warrick | | 657 | | 3,859,571
TOTAL | | | 1,278 | | 8,107,314

 The figures in this table are presented in megawatts (MW) and megawatt hours (MWh), respectively.
 Each facility listed above generates hydroelectric power except the Warrick facility, which generates substantially all of the power used by the Warrick smelting facility from the co-located Warrick power plant using coal purchased from third parties at nearby coal reserves. During 2021, approximately 32% of the capacity from the Warrick power plant was sold into the market under its current operating permits. Alcoa Power Generating Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, also owns certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated transmission assets in Indiana, Tennessee, New York, and Washington.
 The consolidated capacity of the Brazilian energy facilities shown above in megawatts (MW) is the assured energy, representing approximately 52% of hydropower plant nominal capacity. Since May 2015 (after curtailment of the Poços de Caldas and São Luís smelters in Brazil), the excess generation capacity from the Brazilian hydroelectric facilities has been sold into the market.

Region | Electricity | Natural Gas 
North America | Québec, Canada Alcoa’s smelter located in Baie-Comeau, Quebec, purchases approximately one-quarter of its electricity needs from Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. Otherwise, all electricity consumed by the three smelters in Québec is purchased under contracts with Hydro-Québec that expire on December 31, 2029. Massena, New York (Massena West) The Massena West smelter in New York receives power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA that expires in March 2026. | Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources, including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 
Australia | Portland This smelter purchases power from the National Electricity Market (NEM) variable spot market in the state of Victoria. During 2021, the smelter entered into fixed-for-floating swap contracts with AGL Hydro Partnership, Origin Energy Electricity Limited and Alinta Energy CEA Trading Pty Ltd, at a combined level of 515 MW. In addition, in November 2021 the Portland Aluminium joint venture announced the planned restart of 35,000 mtpy of idle capacity (19,000 mtpy Alcoa share) which was underpinned by an additional fixed-for-floating swap contract with AGL Hydro Partnership for 72 MW. These swap contracts manage exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM spot market. The swap contracts will expire on June 30, 2026. | Western Australia AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. In 2015, AofA secured a significant portion of gas supplies to 2032, covering more than 95% of the refineries’ gas requirements through 2023 and decreasing percentages thereafter. In 2020, AofA contracted for additional gas supplies starting in 2024. On a combined basis, these gas supply arrangements are expected to cover more than 80% of the refineries’ gas requirements through 2027.
Europe | San Ciprián, Spain The Company completed the temporary curtailment of its 228,000 mtpy smelting capacity at the San Ciprián smelter in January 2022 pursuant to the agreement reached with the workers’ representatives on December 29, 2021. The smelter purchases its reduced electricity requirements under a bilateral spot power contract that expires June 30, 2022. Lista and Mosjøen, Norway Beginning in 2017, Alcoa entered into several long-term power purchase agreements, which secured approximately 50% of the necessary power for the Norwegian smelters for the period of 2020 to 2035. The remaining 50% is currently purchased under short-term contracts. Financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed through in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission Guidelines and the Norwegian compensation regime. Iceland Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, supplies competitively priced electricity from a hydroelectric facility to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter under a 40-year power contract, which will expire in 2047 with price renegotiation effective from 2027. | Spain In 2021, natural gas was supplied to the San Ciprián, Spain, alumina refinery pursuant to supply contracts with Naturgy and UFG. In January 2022, Naturgy terminated its contract supplying 50 percent of the refinery’s natural gas demand until June 2022 and 25 percent from July to December 2022. The Company is currently negotiating new contracts but has access to adequate supply at spot rates from February 2022 until such new contract arrangements are in place. 
South America | Alumar Further to the announced restart of its 268,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, which is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter 2022, Alcoa entered into several short-term power purchase agreements which secured substantially all of the necessary power for its share of the Alumar smelter for the restart period in 2022 through the end of 2023. Alcoa also entered into multiple long-term power purchase agreements which collectively secured all of the necessary power for its share of the Alumar smelter for the period of 2024 to 2038. All power secured for short and long term is from renewable sources. |

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 The Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available and that the sources and availability of such raw materials are currently adequate. Generally, materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. Substantially all of the raw materials required to manufacture our products are available from more than one supplier. Some sources of these raw materials are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions, which could disrupt supply or affect the price of these materials.
 Certain raw materials, such as caustic soda and calcined petroleum coke, may be subject to significant price volatility which could impact our financial results.
 Alcoa sources bauxite from its own resources, including AWAC entities, and believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future.
 For each metric ton (mt) of alumina produced, Alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities):
 
 
Raw Material | Units | Consumption per mt of Alumina 
-------------------------+-------+----------------------------------------------
Bauxite | mt | 2.2 – 3.7 
Caustic soda | kg | 60 – 100 
Electricity | kWh | 200 to 260 total consumed (0 to 230 imported)
Fuel oil and natural gas | GJ | 6 – 12 
Lime (CaO) | kg | 6 – 60 

 
For each metric ton of aluminum produced, Alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities):
 
 
Raw Material | Units | Consumption per mt of Primary Aluminum
------------------------+-------+---------------------------------------
Alumina | mt | 1.92 ± 0.02 
Aluminum fluoride | kg | 16.3 ± 2.6 
Calcined petroleum coke | mt | 0.38 ± 0.03 
Cathode blocks | mt | 0.005 ± 0.002 
Electricity | kWh | 13.14 – 16.57 
Liquid pitch | mt | 0.09 ± 0.02 
Natural gas | mcf | 3.0 ± 1.0 

 
Certain aluminum we produce includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its aluminum alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association (of which Alcoa is an active member) standard, which uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also include lesser amounts of other constituents. 
 
Competition
 Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the aluminum supply chain in which it competes. Our business segments operate in close proximity to our broad, worldwide customer base to enable us to meet customer demand in key markets in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and China. 
 We compete with a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets across the aluminum supply chain. Competitors include bauxite miners who supply to the third-party bauxite market, active alumina suppliers, refiners and producers, commodity traders, aluminum producers, and producers of alternative materials such as steel, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic, and glass.
 By having an integrated aluminum value chain, we are able to deliver our SustanaTM line of products manufactured through low-carbon emitting processes, which includes: EcoSource™ alumina, Ecolum™ aluminum, and EcoDura™ aluminum.  
 Bauxite:
 We are among the world’s largest bauxite miners. The majority of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production of aluminum. In 2021, approximately 12% of Alcoa’s bauxite shipments were sold to third-party customers and Alcoa-operated mines supply approximately 95% of their volume to Alcoa refineries. 
 9


Alcoa’s share of mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa, including AWAC, has equity interests, supply approximately 55% of their volume to Alcoa refineries. Our principal competitors in the third-party bauxite market include Rio Tinto and multiple suppliers from Guinea, Australia, Indonesia, and Brazil, among other countries. We compete largely based on bauxite quality, price, and proximity to customers, as well as strategically located long-term bauxite resources in Australia, Brazil, and Guinea, which is home to the world’s largest reserves of high-quality metallurgical grade bauxite.
 Alumina:
 We are the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China. The alumina market is global and highly competitive, with many active suppliers, producers, and commodity traders. Our main competitors in the third-party alumina market are Aluminum Corporation of China, South32 Limited, Hangzhou Jinjiang Group, Rio Tinto, and Norsk Hydro ASA. In recent years, there has been significant growth in alumina refining in China and India. The majority of our product is sold in the form of smelter grade alumina. 
 Key factors influencing competition in the alumina market include cost position, price, reliability of bauxite supply, quality, and proximity to customers and end markets. We had an average cost position in the first quartile of global alumina production in 2021. Our refineries are strategically located next to low-cost bauxite mines, which provide a stable and consistent long-term supply of bauxite to our refining portfolio. Our alumina refineries include sophisticated refining technology to maximize efficiency with the bauxite qualities from these internal mines.
 Aluminum:
 In our Aluminum segment, competition is dependent upon the type of product we are selling. 
 The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with commodity traders, such as Glencore, Trafigura, J. Aron and Gerald Group, and aluminum producers such as Emirates Global Aluminum, Norsk Hydro ASA, Rio Tinto, Century Aluminum, Vedanta Aluminum Ltd., and United Company RUSAL Plc.
 Several of the most critical competitive factors in our industry are product quality, production costs (including source, reliability of supply, and cost of energy), price, access and proximity to raw materials, customers and end markets, timeliness of delivery, customer service (including technical support), product innovation, and breadth of offerings. Where aluminum products compete with other materials, the diverse characteristics of aluminum are also a significant factor, particularly its light weight, strength, and recyclability.
 The strength of our position in the primary aluminum market is largely attributable to: our integrated supply chain; long-term energy arrangements; the ability of our casthouses to provide customers with a diverse product portfolio in terms of shapes and alloys; and our decreasing demand for fossil fuels, as approximately 81% of the aluminum smelting portfolio operated by the Company was powered by renewable energy sources in 2021. The Company intends to continue to focus on optimizing capacity utilization. 
 
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
 The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a competitive advantage. The Company’s rights under its intellectual property, as well as the technology and products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2021, Alcoa’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 400 granted patents and 180 pending patent applications. The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served, including the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol.
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation and ParentCo entered into certain intellectual property license agreements that provide for a license of certain patents, trademarks, and know-how from ParentCo or Alcoa Corporation, as applicable, to the other, on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
 
Alcoa’s global operations subject it to compliance with various types of government laws, regulations, and other requirements which often provide discretion to government authorities and could be interpreted, applied, or modified in ways to make the Company’s operations or compliance activities more costly. These laws and regulations include those relating to safety and health (including those made in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), competition, data privacy and security, environmental compliance, and trade, such as tariffs or other import or export restrictions that may increase the cost of raw material or cross-border shipments and impact our ability to do business with certain countries or individuals. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Part I Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Environmental
 Alcoa is subject to extensive federal, state/provincial, and local environmental laws and regulations and other requirements, in the U.S. and abroad, including those relating to the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, and greenhouse gas emissions. We manage environmental assessments and cleanups at approximately 60 locations, which include currently owned or operated facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operated facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, such as U.S. Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. In 2021, capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control were approximately $111 and approximately $174 is expected in 2022. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements under caption Contingencies for additional information. 
Safety and Health
 We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, and our safety program includes measures required for compliance. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we may be subject to government regulations, including potential vaccine mandates, in various locations where we operate. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements, as well as to continually improve our safety systems. We believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
 For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Part I Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our core values – Act with Integrity, Operate with Excellence, Care for People, and Lead with Courage – guide us as a company, including our approach to human capital management. We believe that our people are our greatest asset. The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified, and highly skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce, our executive officers and other key personnel.
 Our Company policies, including the Code of Conduct, Harassment and Bullying Free Workplace Policy, and EHS Vision, Values, Mission, and Policy, support our mission to advance our Company culture and core values. Alcoa maintains a Human Rights Policy that applies globally to the Company, its partnerships, and other business associates, and is committed to abiding by international human rights principles encompassed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, Alcoa had approximately 12,200 employees in 16 countries. Approximately 8,700 of our global employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain unions and varying expiration dates, including approximately 1,000 employees in the U.S., 1,600 employees in Europe, 1,400 employees in Canada, 2,000 employees in South America, and 2,600 employees in Australia. Approximately 900 U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in place with the United Steelworkers (USW). There are also U.S. collective bargaining agreements in place, with varying expiration dates, with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers (IBEW).
 In 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Warrick Rolling Mill in Indiana, which reduced the number of total employees by approximately 1,170. Additionally, the Company is in the process of hiring employees for the restart of the Alumar smelter in Brazil. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 250 employees have been hired.
 Safety and Health 
 The safety and health of our employees, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors are our top priorities and key to our ability to attract and retain talent. We aspire to work safely, all the time, everywhere. We strive to foster a culture of hazard and risk awareness, the effective understanding and use of our safe systems of work, proactive incident reporting, and knowledge sharing to attain this goal. 
 Our systems are designed to prevent loss of life and serious injury at our locations. Our safety programs and systems include rigorous safety standards and controls, periodic risk-based audits, a formal and standardized process for investigating fatal and all serious injury potential incidents, management of critical risks and safety hazards, and efforts to eliminate hazards or implement controls to prevent and mitigate risks. 
 11


We document any incident that has the potential to cause a serious injury, and strive to maintain a culture of speaking up, where incidents are reported and ideas are shared. We have operating standards based on human performance, which teaches employees how to anticipate and recognize situations where errors are likely to occur, in order to allow us to predict, reduce, manage, and prevent fatalities and injuries. We integrate our temporary workers, contractors, and visitors into our safety programs and data through our OneAlcoa: United for Safety initiative.
 Operational employees are required to take safety and health training that is determined by their specific roles, tasks, areas where they work, job functions, and responsibilities. Salaried employees are expected to include a safety objective in their annual performance objectives. We believe having an individual safety objective empowers our employees to be more involved in creating our safety culture. To further support this, we have included a safety metric focused on reducing fatalities and serious injuries in our annual incentive program for the past several years.
 See Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Business Update – Coronavirus for additional information on the health and safety protocols implemented by the Company for the protection of its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Inclusion, Diversity, and Equality
 We seek to provide a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and makes Alcoa a desired employer. We seek to hire local candidates when possible and continue to focus on the diversity of our candidate pool. 
 We remain focused on advancing inclusion, diversity, and equality. As of December 31, 2021, women comprised approximately 17.2% of our global workforce. We are committed to achieving gender balance across Alcoa through long-term actions to improve diversity and inclusion. To support these efforts, for the past several years, we have included a metric in our annual incentive plan focused on increasing the gender diversity of our global workforce. 
 We also recognize the benefits and importance of diversity among our board of directors and senior management. Of the 10 directors on our board of directors, 30% are women, 20% are racially/ethnically diverse, and 30% hold citizenship outside of the United States. Additionally, 33% of our Executive Team are women.
 In October 2020, we launched our Global Inclusion & Diversity Council of diverse leaders across the Company to support the execution of our inclusion and diversity strategy aimed at building an inclusive culture where employees feel valued, empowered, and respected. For 2021, our annual incentive plan included a metric focused on increased hiring of underrepresented groups. We offer several global resources and inclusion groups for our employees, including: AWARE – Alcoans working actively for racial-ethnic equality; EAGLE, our LGBT+ Equality inclusion group; and AWN – Alcoa Women’s Network.
