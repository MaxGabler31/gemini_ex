Item 1. Business
Company Overview



We are a provider of digital payment solutions and services to businesses and consumers. We are focused on operating and developing “e-wallets” that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form, and remit the funds to Mexico and other countries quickly and securely. Our first e-wallet, the Beyond Wallet, is currently operational. Our flagship e-wallet, IPSIPay, was soft launched in December 2021 and will be fully launched during the second quarter of 2022.



Previously, we intended to invest in physical kiosks which required the user presence at digital payment kiosk locations, and we still intend to use our existing kiosks in certain target markets within Southern California.



We acquired a 10% strategic interest in Frictionless Financial Technologies, Inc. (“Frictionless”), on June 22, 2021. Frictionless agreed to deliver to us, a live fully compliant financial payment Software as a Service solution for use by us as a digital payment platform that enables payments within the United States and abroad, including Mexico, together with a service agreement providing a full suite of product services to facilitate our anticipated product offerings. We have an irrevocable right to acquire up to an additional 41% of the outstanding common stock of Frictionless at a purchase price of $300,000 for each 1% acquired.



On August 26, 2021, we formed a new majority owned subsidiary, Beyond Fintech Inc. (“Beyond Fintech”), in which we own a 51% stake, with Frictionless owning the remaining 49%. Beyond Fintech acquired an exclusive license to our Beyond Wallet offering to further its objective of providing virtual payment services allowing U.S. persons to transfer funds to Mexico and other countries.



Our Strategy and Market



We offer a simple digital e-wallet and digital payment solution for consumers and businesses. We soft launched our IPSIPay app in December 2021 and plan to fully launch our IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet e-wallet brands in the second quarter of 2022. As a California based fintech company, our initial launch will be in the Central Valley region in California, which is the largest agricultural belt in the U.S. Our platform (which can be used both business-to-business and business-to-consumer) will facilitate the transfer of funds in digital form to other countries, initially Mexico but also, India and the Philippines, primarily from hand-held devices as well as on desktop or laptop computers.












Our launch plan for IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet is to target lower income, migrant communities in California (notably in the agriculture industry), and expanding to other states with large migrant populations such as Texas and Florida. According to the American Immigration Counsel, in 2018, 10.6 million immigrants (foreign-born individuals) comprised 27 percent of the population of California, and the top country of origin for immigrants was Mexico, at 38 percent of immigrants. According to The Wilson Center Mexico Institute, the market for money remittance from California to Mexico during 2021 was estimated to be approximately $16.25 billion. We therefore believe our market is not only large and growing, but that servicing this market is socially responsible. We believe our digital payment facilitation platform and related apps will empower and enable the unbanked and under-served and payment providers who service these users, acting as a bridge to provide access to comprehensive and easy to use payment solutions. Given the large size of our addressable market, our ability to capture even a very small share of the market represents a significant revenue opportunity for our company.



Previously, we intended to provide digital payment solutions via kiosks, as part of our strategy. However due to the delays experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, we pivoted to a mobile platform, we believe will offer our users more convenience, security and efficiency through hand-held mobile devices, while significantly reducing our capital expenditures.



Services and Business Model



Our primary sources of revenue is commissions and fees from the use of our digital suite of products without physical custody of customer funds. Our fully functional apps includes the ability to use an e-wallet, Visa debit cards, bill payment platform, e-commerce and the ability to buy gold and silver. We believe we have the ability and technology to add micro-loans, tele-medicine services as well as payroll services to our apps in the future.


In addition to these revenue generators, we intend releasing our BeyondAgro software to enable growers to improve business management and management of contract employees, particularly migrant workers. This will be offered as a monthly fee-based SaaS platform.



Our revenue will include fees derived from the use of debit cards, ATM fees, merchant processing fees, money transfer fees, commissions on international bill payments and, in the near future micro-loans and tele-medicine.



Marketing



We intend to initially focus on the underserved labor markets, initially focusing on the Californian agriculture industry to acquire customers for our IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet apps. We will use direct social media marketing strategies to the business to consumer market.



Our marketing effort will be directed towards businesses, initially towards agricultural businesses. In marketing our software platform, we believe we have a differentiated product that will allow agricultural companies to pay their laborers with e-wallet money transfers instead of traditional check payments. The laborers will then be able to transfer funds, pay utility bills and send money abroad cheaper and more conveniently with instant settlement, a product offering that, we believe, does not exist at present.



Competition



The payment service business is highly competitive and continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Companies like Western Union, Money Gram, Paypal, and Venmo, dominate the money remittance business, and most of our competitors have far greater sources of financing, greater name recognition and have been engaged in the industry longer than we have.



We believe, however that the differentiator with the IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet apps is our ability to provide the unbanked and under-served the ability to transact without the use of a traditional bank account, with greater convenience, lower costs and instant settlement, and with free wallet-to-wallet transfers, and the ability to upload funds onto Visa debit cards across borders. We believe the design of our apps will be highly attractive to our initial target communities, thus allowing our product to compete effectively.



Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our technology and the technology that we license and/or that we develop in the future. We presently have three trademark applications on file and under review, and our 51% subsidiary Beyond Fintech has an additional three trademark applications on file and under review.
Government and Environmental Regulation and Laws



We act as a facilitator between consumers and finance product providers, and therefore operate in a highly regulated industry. While we do not believe that our core business as a facilitator presently is subject to significant government regulation our finance product providers are subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore may expect to experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed upon them. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, making compliance challenging, and may indirectly increase our operating costs and legal risks (or directly should it be determined that our business model is or becomes subject to more extensive regulation). In particular, there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist financing. Our providers may have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in non-compliance with such laws, and these judgement calls, to the extent they curtail the availability of the applicable financial product, could harm our business.












To the extent our business is or will be involved in the utilization of blockchain or cryptocurrency, the regulatory regime governing these sectors is highly uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect our business plans. Regulation of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.



In addition, any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information in connection with IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet, could subject us to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties.



Any violations of any of the foregoing or similar laws, rules or regulations could adversely affect our ability to maintain IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.



Human Capital/Employees



As of December 31, 2021, we had 6 full time employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and President or Chief Financial Officer and 4 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.



Our Corporate History and Background



We were incorporated on September 25, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada originally under the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. On May 27, 2016, Asiya Pearls, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Asiya Pearls, Inc. to QPAGOS.

On May 12, 2016, we (at that time, under the name QPAGOS), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Qpagos Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Qpagos Corporation”), and Qpagos Merge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of our company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016, the merger was consummated, and Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the “Merger”), with Qpagos Corporation continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger.



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of Qpagos Corporation’s capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into the right to receive two shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”). Additionally, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, we assumed all of Qpagos Corporation’s warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, which were exercisable for approximately 621,920 shares of Common Stock, respectively, as of the date of the Merger. Prior to and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, the then-current stockholder of 500,000 shares of Common Stock agreed to return to us 497,500 shares of Common Stock held by such holder and the then-current stockholder retained an aggregate of 2,500 shares of Common Stock and the other stockholders retained 500,000 shares of Common Stock. Therefore, immediately following the Merger, Qpagos Corporation’s former stockholders held 4,992,900 shares of Common Stock which represented approximately 91% of the then outstanding Common Stock.



The Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of our company, which was then a public shell company, for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As such, Qpagos Corporation was treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while IPSI was treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes.



Qpagos Corporation was incorporated on May 1, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware to effectuate a reverse merger transaction with Qpagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Qpagos Mexico”) and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Redpag”). Each of the entities were incorporated in November 2013 in Mexico.



Qpagos Mexico was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with, and Redpag was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor. 



On June 1, 2016, our board of directors of changed our fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31.



On November 1, 2019, we changed our name from QPAGOS to Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc. Additionally, and immediately following the name change, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to affect a reverse split of the Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-10, effective on November 1, 2019 (the Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each ten pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding automatically combined into one new share of Common Stock without any further action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reduced from 320,477,867 shares to 32,047,817 after rounding for fractional shares.



On December 31, 2019, we consummated the disposal of Qpagos Corporation, Qpagos Mexico and Redpag in exchange for 2,250,000 shares (the “Vivi Shares”) of common stock of Vivi Holdings, Inc. (“Vivi” or “Vivi Holdings”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 5, 2019 (the “SPA”). Of the 2,250,000 shares of Vivi, nine percent (9%) was allocated as follows: Gaston Pereira (5%), Andrey Novikov (2.5%), and Joseph Abrams (1.5%). The SPA closed on December 31, 2019 after the satisfaction of customary conditions, the receipt of a final fairness opinion and the approval of our shareholders. As a result of this transaction, we no longer has any Mexican subsidiaries.











We acquired a 10% strategic interest in Frictionless on June 22, 2021. Frictionless agreed to deliver to us, a live, fully compliant financial payment Software as a Service solution for use by us as a digital payment platform that enables payments within the United States and abroad, including Mexico, together with a service agreement providing a full suite of product services to facilitate our anticipated product offerings. We hold an irrevocable right to acquire up to an additional 41% of the outstanding common stock of Frictionless at a purchase price of $300,000 for each 1% acquired.



On August 26, 2021, we formed a new subsidiary, Beyond Fintech to acquire a product known as Beyond Wallet from a third party, together with the logo, use of name and implementation of the product into our technology. We own 51% of Beyond Fintech with the other 49% owned by Frictionless.
