 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (“AWI” or the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891. When we refer to “we,” “our” and “us” in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.
 AWI is a leading manufacturer and designer of ceiling systems for use in the construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings in the Americas. Our products primarily include mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, wood fiber, glass-reinforced-gypsum and felt. We also manufacture ceiling suspension system (grid) products through a joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. ("Worthington") called Worthington Armstrong Venture ("WAVE").
 Reportable Segments
 Our operating segments are as follows: Mineral Fiber, Architectural Specialties and Unallocated Corporate. 
Mineral Fiber – produces suspended mineral fiber and soft fiber ceiling systems for use in commercial and residential settings. Our mineral fiber products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection, aesthetic appeal, and health and sustainability features. Commercial ceiling products are sold to resale distributors and to ceiling systems contractors. Residential ceiling products are sold primarily to wholesalers and retailers (including large home centers). The Mineral Fiber segment also includes the results of WAVE, which manufactures and sells suspension system (grid) products and ceiling component products that are invoiced by both AWI and WAVE. Segment results relating to WAVE consist primarily of equity earnings and reflect our 50% equity interest in the joint venture. Ceiling component products consist of ceiling perimeters and trim, in addition to grid products that support drywall ceiling systems. For some customers, WAVE sells its suspension systems products to AWI for resale to customers. Mineral Fiber segment results reflect those sales transactions.
    Architectural Specialties – produces, designs and sources ceilings and walls for use in commercial settings. Products are available in numerous materials, such as metal, felt and wood, in addition to various colors, shapes and designs. Products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection and aesthetic appeal. We sell standard, premium and customized products, a portion of which are derived from sourced products. Architectural Specialties products are sold primarily to resale distributors and direct customers, primarily ceiling systems contractors. The majority of this segment's revenues are project driven, which can lead to more volatile sales patterns due to project scheduling uncertainty.

Unallocated Corporate – includes assets, liabilities, income and expenses that have not been allocated to our other business segments and consists of: cash and cash equivalents, the net funded status of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan (“RIP”), the estimated fair value of interest rate swap contracts, outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility and income tax balances.
Overview
 Our business has been built on providing high-quality, innovative products through a highly focused service model as well as by maintaining strong brand awareness and trust. We are committed to delivering profitable topline growth and sustainable shareholder value by strengthening our core Mineral Fiber segment and expanding our Architectural Specialties segment into new, adjacent business categories and sectors. Through this strategy, we have delivered consistent growth in mineral fiber sales dollars per unit sold through product innovation, including our Healthy Spaces products, Total Acoustics® solutions and Sustain® family of products, and we have built the broadest portfolio of architectural specialties products for ceilings and walls in our markets. Our current strategic initiatives focus on further leveraging innovation, digitalization and the movement toward healthier and sustainable indoor environments for additional growth.
Acquisitions
 In December 2020, we acquired all the issued and outstanding equity of Arktura LLC (“Arktura”) and certain subsidiaries with operations in the United States and Argentina. Arktura is a designer and fabricator of metal and felt ceilings, walls, partitions and facades with one manufacturing facility based in Los Angeles, California.
In August 2020, we acquired the business and assets of Moz Designs, Inc. (“Moz”), based in Oakland, California. Moz is a designer and fabricator of custom architectural metal ceilings, walls, dividers and column covers for interior and exterior applications with one manufacturing facility.
In July 2020, we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of TURF Design, Inc. (“Turf”), with one manufacturing facility in Elgin, Illinois and a design center in Chicago, Illinois. Turf is a designer and manufacturer of acoustic felt ceilings and wall products.

In November 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK Industries, Inc. (“MRK”), based in Libertyville, Illinois. MRK is a manufacturer of specialty metal ceiling, wall and exterior solutions with one manufacturing facility.
In March 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Architectural Components Group, Inc. (“ACGI”), based in Marshfield, Missouri. ACGI is a manufacturer of custom wood ceilings and walls with one manufacturing facility.
The operations, assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are included in our Architectural Specialties segment.
Discontinued Operations
 In 2019, we completed the sale of certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (“EMEA”) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by WAVE, our joint venture with Worthington in which AWI holds a 50% interest (collectively, the “Sale”), to Knauf International GmbH (“Knauf”). In January 2021, we finalized post-closing adjustments to the purchase price related to certain pension liabilities assumed by Knauf in the Sale. During the first quarter of 2021, we paid $11.8 million to Knauf related to this purchase price adjustment.
 The EMEA and Pacific Rim segment historical financial results through September 30, 2019 have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as discontinued operations.
 See Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions and discontinued operations.
 Markets
 We primarily operate in the United States, Canada and Latin America. We are well positioned in the industry sectors and categories in which we operate, often holding a leadership position. Our products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall and a wide range of specialty ceiling products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. The major markets in which we compete are:
 Commercial Construction. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Renovation work (also known as replacement/remodel) is estimated to represent the majority of the commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from the following sectors of commercial construction – office, education, transportation, healthcare and retail. We monitor U.S. construction starts and project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 24 months. We also monitor office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, state and local government spending, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. Additionally, we believe that customer preferences for product type, style, color, performance attributes (such as acoustics, sustainability and health attributes), availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue.
In our Mineral Fiber segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial construction market sales are used for existing building renovation purposes by end-users of our products. In our Architectural Specialties segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial market sales are used for new building construction by end-users of our products. The end-use of our products is based on management estimates as such information is not easily determinable.
Residential Construction. We also sell mineral fiber products for use in single and multi-family housing. We estimate that existing home renovation work represents the majority of the residential construction market opportunity. Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.
Customers
 We use our reputation, capabilities, service, innovation and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. We have important relationships with national home centers such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., with wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers, and also with architects and designers who specify products.

In 2021, approximately 70% of our consolidated net sales were to distributors. Sales to large home centers accounted for slightly less than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Our remaining sales were primarily to direct customers and retailers.
Gross sales to distributors Foundation Building Materials, Inc. and GMS Inc. totaled $495.8 million and individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated gross sales in 2021. These sales were included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments.
 Working Capital
 We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers. Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements. We sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future. These practices are typical within the industry.
Competition
 The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions, namely, drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum). Excess industry capacity exists for certain products, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies are our primary competitors:
 CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by Rockwool International A/S), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rockfon A/S (owned by Rockwool International A/S), USG Corporation (owned by Gebr. Knauf KG), Ceilings Plus (owned by USG Corporation), Rulon International, and 9Wood.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials are fiberglass, perlite, recycled paper and starch. Other raw materials include clays, felt, pigment, wood and wood fiber. We manufacture most of our mineral wool needs at one of our manufacturing facilities. Finally, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures grid products.
 We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.
 In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.
 Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs. Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.
 Sourced Products
 Some of the products we sell are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products. We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Europe and the Pacific Rim. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 9% of our total consolidated revenue in 2021.
 In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products. However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.
 Seasonality
 Generally, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
 Patent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
 Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
 Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation,  , Armstrong®, 24/7 Defend, ACOUSTIBuilt®, AirAssure, Airtite®, Arktura®, Calla®, Cirrus®, Cortega®, DESIGNFlex®, Dune, Feltworks®, Humiguard®, Infusions®, InvisAcoustics, Kanopi, Lyra®, MetalWorks, Moz, Optima®, Plasterform, Soundscapes®, Sustain®, Tectum®, Total Acoustics®, Turf®, Ultima®, and WoodWorks®, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
 In connection with the separation and distribution of our former flooring business into a separate publicly-traded company, Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (“AFI”), in 2016, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI. These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement. Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the “Armstrong” trade name and logo. Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a royalty-free license to utilize the “Inspiring Great Spaces” tagline, logo and related color scheme, which expires December 31, 2022.
 In connection with the closing of the Sale, we entered into a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf for its benefit (and, under sublicense, to the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf) under which they license certain patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in certain licensed territories.
 We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks at least annually for potential impairment. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Sustainability and Environmental Matters
 As a leading building products manufacturer, we are committed to operating sustainably across all areas of our business. This commitment is reflected in our ongoing initiatives to design and develop sustainable ceiling and wall products and solutions for every space. Sustainability in our business reflects our mission to make a difference in the lives of people where they live, work, learn, heal and play. Our approach to sustainability is designed to support our strategic priorities, align with stakeholder interests, and be visible and measurable.
Our sustainability program is organized around three program “pillars”: People, Planet and Product.
Under the People pillar, we are broadly focused on increasing our engagement in the communities where we operate, evaluating our benefits and compensation structure for all levels of the organization, promoting and maintaining a diverse, talented and growing workforce, encouraging and protecting human rights, and creating a safe working environment for our employees.
Our Planet pillar broadly focuses on reducing our greenhouse gas footprint, reducing or recapturing water in our operations, and reducing waste in our operations. These efforts include our ceilings recycling program, which diverts reclaimed ceiling tiles from landfills, and our reduction of our environmental operating footprint. Additionally, we are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.
 Under the Product pillar, we are broadly focused on ensuring our products are free of chemicals of concern, reducing our products’ water and greenhouse gas footprint, and continuing to invest in solutions that meet customer demand for building products that align with their sustainability goals. We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers, including through our Sustain® portfolio, will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.

The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.
In 2021, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report , including our targets for 2030. We expect to update our progress regularly. The report is available in the "Sustainability" section of our website, which is listed below. Information in the Sustainability Report or the Company's website is not incorporated herein by reference.
 Human Capital
 Workforce Demographics. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately 2,800 and 2,700 full time and part time employees, respectively. During 2021, our total voluntary and involuntary turnover rates were approximately 8% and 2%, respectively, for non-production employees and 12% and 4%, respectively, for production employees.
 As of December 31, 2021, approximately 58% of our approximately 1,300 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 100 employees at one U.S. plant will expire during 2022. We believe that our relations with our employees are constructive and positive.
Employee Health and Safety. Safety is a core value at AWI and our culture is committed to making safety a personal core value for every employee. Our overall goal is to eliminate workplace injuries. We promote and foster an environment of empowerment and sharing throughout the company at all levels and in all locations. We engage our employees on safety with a focus on risk identification and elimination and through tracking various leading indicators. We track Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recordable injuries and lost time rates by location monthly. We establish safety targets annually, which are tracked and reported to leadership monthly and reviewed with our Board of Directors.
We offer competitive health and wellness benefits to eligible employees and periodically conduct analyses of plan utilization to further tailor our employee benefits to meet their ongoing needs. In response to COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines from governmental and local health authorities across our facilities and have implemented preventative measures that include remote and hybrid work models, providing personal protective equipment, limiting group meetings, enhancing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and social distancing. A significant portion of our workforce began working fully remote in mid-March 2020 and continued to do so as of December 31, 2020. In the third quarter of 2021, we instituted a hybrid work model which allowed employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely to continue doing so for a portion of the week. During 2020, we implemented an Emergency Paid Leave policy for all employees which expired on December 31, 2021. This policy granted additional paid time off for any employee impacted by COVID-19.
 Diversity and Inclusion. We continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity and inclusion, as we believe it is a key to our future success. This commitment is most recently reflected in the goals of the People Pillar of our Sustainability program, which is being led by our Vice President of Talent Sustainability. We measure gender and racial/ethnic representation and are focusing on our incoming new hires to assist in increasing diversity within the company. In addition, we are committed to engaging in events and outreach that align with our goals to enhance our diversity and inclusion. Our strategy to grow our diversity over time includes (1) providing annual training to employees on diversity and inclusion topics, (2) demonstrating year over year improvement in the diversity of our organization measured by representation of female, minorities and veterans at every level of the organization, and (3) providing employees an opportunity to share their views on topics that matter to them. As of December 31, 2021, our executive leadership team, defined as the chief executive officer and direct reports to the chief executive officer, included 43% gender diversity, compared to 20% as of December 31, 2020.
Product Innovation
 Product innovation activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products’ competitiveness. Principal product innovation functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.
Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
 Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. We are

one of several potentially responsible parties in these matters and have agreed to jointly fund the required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability. We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.
Most of our facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.
 From time to time, we are involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. In connection with those matters, we may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of any proceedings relating to these matters, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Liabilities of $0.7 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
