Item 1. Business
Overview
Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet.
In recent years, the technology industry has undergone a massive transition from on-premise hardware and software that customers buy, to services in the cloud that they rent. Organizations find themselves at different points in this transition to the cloud. Regardless of where organizations are in their transition, they all face a common set of challenges: they exist in a complex, heterogeneous infrastructure environment which exacerbates the fundamental problems of the Internet more than ever, and the on-premise hardware boxes that they once relied upon to solve these problems were never designed to work in such an environment. As more workloads move to the cloud, there is no point in installing additional hardware boxes on premise. An on-premise box will not solve the problems organizations now face. Nor can a business ship a hardware box to a cloud vendor. Even if they wanted to, there is literally no place to install such a box in the cloud.
The result is that a major architectural shift at the network layer is now underway. Previously, enterprises would often string together a diverse set of on-premise hardware boxes from different vendors to solve their network challenges. As these solutions move to the cloud, the network latency, support complexity, and cost of overhead makes stringing together multiple point-cloud solutions that only address a specific network need untenable. Customers are therefore looking to consolidate behind a single global cloud services provider.
Cloudflare is a global cloud services provider that delivers a broad range of services to businesses of all sizes and in all geographies—making them more secure, enhancing the performance of their business-critical applications, and eliminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware. Our network serves as a scalable, easy-to-use, unified control plane to deliver security, performance, and reliability across on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. We serve comprehensive customer needs across security, performance, and reliability.
Our Network
We have built an efficient, scalable network that allows us to rapidly develop and deploy our products for our customers. 
We created a network architecture that is flexible, scalable, and gets more and more efficient as it expands. We designed and built our network to be able to grow capacity quickly and inexpensively; to allow for every server, in every city, to run nearly every Cloudflare service; and to allow us to shift customers and traffic across our network efficiently. We refer to this architecture as “serverless” because it means we can deploy standard, commodity hardware, and our product developers and customers do not need to worry about the underlying servers. Our software is designed to manage the deployment and execution of our product developers’ code and our customers’ code across our network. Because we manage the execution and prioritization of code running across our network, it means that we are both able to improve the performance of our highest paying customers, and also effectively leverage idle capacity across our network. We have chosen to utilize this idle capacity to create a free tier of service which has generated substantial global scale for us. In turn, this scale makes us attractive partners for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) globally, which reduces our co-location and bandwidth costs. As our network grows, these dynamics become even more powerful. Today, our network spans more than 250 cities in over 100 countries worldwide and interconnects with over 10,000 networks globally, including major ISPs, cloud services, and enterprises. 
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Acquire New Customers: We believe that any person or business that relies on the Internet to deliver products, services, or content can be a Cloudflare customer. We plan to continue to grow our customer base across all of our offerings—free, pay-as-you-go, and contracted.
◦Free: We will continue to invest in awareness and functionality of our products to drive overall customer growth beyond the millions of Internet properties using Cloudflare today.
◦Pay-as-you-go and Contracted: We believe we have an opportunity to continue to grow our paying customer base, from small customers through to large contracted customers. In order to do this, we will continue to focus on growth in our pay-as-you-go channels by improving targeting and conversion as well as expanding our product offering. In addition, we intend to leverage our proven sales force to sell our products to larger contracted customers.
•Expand Our Relationships with Existing Customers: Customers expand their relationships with us by upgrading to premium plans, increasing their usage of our products, or adding products. Once a customer has adopted one product on our platform, it can easily add additional products with a single click.
•Develop New Products and Solutions: We continue to invest in new product development and building new solutions for our customers, and as we onboard more customers and more traffic on our network, our ability to identify promising new avenues for innovation improves. We have proven our ability to launch new products, having successfully brought many new products and product families to market. 
•Extend Our Serverless Platform Strategy: We have seen a growing number of customers that have chosen to bring applications to market using Cloudflare Workers. This has opened up an entirely new market for us: storage and compute. Our Cloudflare Workers offering is attractive in the market for reasons of our architecture and the power of our network, and we believe adoption of Cloudflare Workers will continue to grow as we further invest in it.
Our Products
We deliver a suite of deeply integrated products that serve as a unified control plane for our customers. Customers can quickly and easily join Cloudflare by using just one of our products and expand over time by adding most products with a single click. Our integrated suite of products consists of (1) solutions for an organization's external-facing infrastructure (such as websites, apps, and APIs) to deliver security, performance, and reliability, (2) solutions to serve an organization's internal resources (such as internal networks and devices), (3) developer-based solutions, and (4) consumer offerings.
Cloudflare for External-Facing Infrastructure
Cloudflare offers a suite of products to help ensure that external-facing infrastructure (such as websites, applications, and APIs) that are exposed to the Internet are safe from attack, fast, and reliable.
Security
We provide an integrated cloud-based security solution designed to secure any combination of platforms, including public cloud, private cloud, on-premise, SaaS applications, and IoT devices. Our key security product offerings include:
•Cloud Firewall: Protects a customer’s Internet properties from common vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and cross-site forgery requests, with no changes to its existing infrastructure.
•Bot Management: Blocks undesired or malicious Internet traffic created by malicious software algorithms called bots, while still allowing useful bots to access Internet properties through machine learning and behavioral analytics.

•Anycast Network: Enhances performance and reliability by globally and automatically load balancing Internet-scale traffic across our network based on proximity of request and other factors.
•Virtual Backbone: Connects our global network, and by extension, our customer’s Internet properties, into a virtual network that is always encrypted, optimized for performance, and highly redundant.
•DNS: Keeps Internet properties online and available around the world (products known as “Cloudflare DNS” and “Cloudflare Secondary DNS”).
•DNS Resolver: Returns the IP addresses of servers when a user enters a domain name. We are one of the world’s fastest public DNS Resolvers, which benefits our DNS customers.
•Always Online: Serves a limited copy of a cached website, to keep it online for a customer’s visitors should the customer’s origin server go down.
•Virtual Waiting Room: Allows organizations to route large volumes of users to a custom-branded waiting room, helping preserve customer experience and protect origin servers from being overwhelmed with requests (product known as "Cloudflare Waiting Room").
Cloudflare for Internal Infrastructure
Cloudflare provides a comprehensive, cloud-based network-as-a-service solution that is designed to be secure, fast, reliable, and define the future of the corporate network. Whereas some large companies had built their own proprietary networks to control and protect their employees working in virtual space, that model had significant limitations, including a price tag that was prohibitive for most companies and an inability to adapt well to increased use of mobile devices and remote work. By leveraging the public Internet, Cloudflare brings together in a single 
pane of glass how employees connect, on-ramps for branch offices, secure connectivity for applications, and controlled access to SaaS. 
Broadly speaking, the Cloudflare internal infrastructure solution has two components: (i) on-ramps, which connect users, devices, or locations to Cloudflare's network; and (ii) filters, which are the products that protect, inspect, and privilege data.
On-ramps
These products connect a user, device, or location to Cloudflare's edge. This effectively enables Cloudflare to act as a secure WAN for all entities on a corporate network regardless what device they use or where they are located.
•Wide Area Network connectivity: Connects and routes traffic between different networks within an enterprise (that are often broadly geographically dispersed) across Cloudflare's network (product known as "Magic WAN").
•Endpoint connectivity: Connects and routes traffic of end-user devices like phones and PCs to the Cloudflare network (product known as "Cloudflare Warp").
•IP connectivity: Extends the benefits of our network to customers' on-premise and data center networks (product known as "Cloudflare Magic Transit"). Magic Transit is deployed in front of an enterprise network and protects it at the IP layer from DDoS attacks and enables provisioning of a full suite of virtual network functions, including IP packet filtering and firewalling, load balancing, and traffic management tools.
•Physical Internet connectivity: Direct internet connectivity between on-premise network and Cloudflare wherever they are. Connection is offered either via a private network interconnect (PNI) or over an Internet Exchange (IX). (product known as “Cloudflare Network Interconnect” or “CNI”). 
•Traffic acceleration: Intelligent routing of network traffic using our Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing product.
Filters
These products shield users from attacks, inspect traffic for threats, and apply privilege rules to grant access to data and applications.
•Identity and access management: Enforces zero trust application access based on identity (product known as “Cloudflare Access”).
•Traffic filtering: Filters all traffic crossing to devices to prevent malicious traffic reaching end-user devices (product known as “Cloudflare Gateway”).
•Network filtering: Cloud-based firewall enables administrators to set policies for all traffic entering and leaving the network (product known as “Cloudflare Magic Firewall”).
•Browser isolation: Runs a customer's browsers in the cloud as opposed to on-device, insulating devices from attacks (product known as "Remote Browser Isolation").
Developer-based Solutions
By leveraging our serverless platform, developers can build serverless applications that scale without needing to spend time and effort on infrastructure or operations. This enables them to deliver more performant applications that have instant global scale, all while improving their productivity. Our key serverless products include:
•Serverless Computing/Programmable Network: Allows developers to augment existing applications or create entirely new ones through a lightweight execution environment without configuring or maintaining infrastructure (product known as “Cloudflare Workers”).
•Website Development: Allows frontend developers to quickly and easily build, collaborate on, and deploy websites (product known as “Cloudflare Pages”).
•Domain Registration: Offers secure registration and management of domain names (product known as “Cloudflare Registrar”).
•Cloudflare Apps: Offers an open suite of tools which can be installed instantly with just a few clicks. We have further expanded our offering through Cloudflare Apps with Workers, which allows developers to package Cloudflare Workers, delivering new Cloudflare Workers-powered experiences to our customers.
•Analytics: Provides insights into the traffic of our customers’ Internet properties that are unique and proprietary to Cloudflare. We help our customers monitor threats, search for specific search engine crawlers, understand DNS query traffic, and analyze real time data traffic.
•Data Localization Management: Tool to set rules and controls at the network edge about where data is stored and protected, while taking advantage of Cloudflare's global network (product known as "Cloudflare Data Localization Suite").
Consumer Offerings
Our consumer products make it easy for individuals to have a performant and secure Internet experience. Adoption of our consumer offerings makes our business offerings more powerful and adoption of our business offerings improves our consumer offerings. Our consumer offerings also have been an effective and differentiated marketing channel to increase the awareness of our brand. Our key consumer product offerings include:
•Consumer DNS Resolver: A consumer app that provides a fast and private way to browse the Internet (product known as "1.1.1.1"). 1.1.1.1 is a public DNS resolver, but unlike most DNS resolvers, we do not sell user data to advertisers. Our implementation of 1.1.1.1 makes it among the fastest resolvers available, and we support DNS over HTTPS (DoH) which encrypts and secures consumers’ DNS requests. An additional version of our consumer DNS resolver adds a layer of protection to consumer home networks and protects them from malware and adult content (product known as "1.1.1.1 for Families").
•Consumer VPN: A VPN for consumers designed to secure and accelerate traffic on mobile devices (product known as "Warp"). The basic version of Warp is included as an option with the 1.1.1.1 App for free; and a premium version that accelerates a user's Internet access is available for purchase.
Our Customers
We view our millions of free and paying customers (excluding customers of our consumer offerings), which manage millions of Internet properties on our network, as part of a broad, global community. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 140,000 paying customers across more than 170 countries. Our paying customer base is highly diversified across organizations of all sizes in every major industry vertical including technology, healthcare, financial services, consumer and retail, industrial, non-profit, and government. Our large customer count has increased from 526 as of December 31, 2019 to 828 as of December 31, 2020 to 1,416 as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding the definitions of our "paying customers" and "large customers."
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Initiatives We Support
In support of our mission, we have launched various initiatives to help build a better Internet, including:
•Project Galileo: Since 2014, we have equipped at-risk public interest groups with a set of our products at no cost to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work. The more than 1,400 recipients of services under Project Galileo include independent journalists reporting on repressive regimes, minority rights and arts groups in closed societies, and civil society organizations supporting democratic movements.
•Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments’ election websites have the highest level of protection and reliability for free. We have provided these benefits to more than 280 state and local election websites.
•Cloudflare for Campaigns: In January 2020, we announced the Cloudflare for Campaigns program that provides security services to help political campaigns in the United States and around the world defend against cyberattacks and election interference. We allow any eligible campaign to access a variety of our security services, including enhanced firewall protection, DDoS attack mitigation, as well as internal data management and security controls.
•Project Fair Shot: In January 2021, we announced Project Fair Shot to provide our Cloudflare Waiting Room product for free to any government, municipality, hospital, pharmacy, or other organization responsible for distributing COVID-19 vaccines. Project Fair Shot is open to eligible organizations around the world and has been extended until at least July 1, 2022.
Our Technology
Our distributed and proprietary network is the core of our technology, and enables us to move data seamlessly from nearly any point on earth in a fast, efficient, and reliable manner. Our network has been built from the ground up as a single software stack we developed that runs our products in more than 250 cities and over 100 countries worldwide. This allows us to scale quickly while offering a wide range of products and simultaneously lowering operating expenses.
Efficient Serverless Network Design
We have developed a single software stack that is responsible for all of our products. We have been able to efficiently scale our network by building it with commodity hardware components that are powered by our proprietary software. This integrated stack has made scaling, debugging, optimizing, and operating our network and products easier and cheaper. It also allows us to deploy changes across our entire worldwide network in a matter of seconds. In addition, we embed encryption chips into the motherboards of our servers that are designed to preclude anyone else from running unauthorized software on our equipment. This allows us to securely and quickly expand our infrastructure far and wide in order to offer the best service and drive down operating costs.
Our serverless network design allows each individual machine in our global network to run our software suite and provide our products. We have built coordination software that ties together these thousands of machines into a single global network that allows us to efficiently route traffic to different physical locations and to individual machines. This enables us to maximize utilization of our commodity hardware and provide different service levels to different customers. It also allows our network to get more efficient and powerful as we add each incremental server, regardless of where it is located. Every time we add a server or add a new city, our entire network improves.
Network Flexibility
Our network and products are API-driven and designed for developers. We have an API-first mentality, which means anything a customer can do via our web interface can also be performed by our API. This allows our customers to easily embed our service in their own workflows. For example, a customer can use our web interface or API to change its custom configuration and that will be rolled out globally by our configuration software in seconds. This contrasts with many other vendors’ solutions where configuration changes can take hours and require professional services.
Our software is designed to spread loads dynamically across our entire distributed network depending on current network conditions and traffic priority. This enables us to deliver different quality of service depending on what customers pay us, ensuring our highest paying customers get the best performance and permitting us to serve our lower paying and free customers from excess capacity.
Given the distributed and highly efficient nature of our network, we can easily develop new features and products on our platform and deploy them without significant incremental costs. The flexibility of our serverless platform allows us to open it to third parties to write code directly on our network through our Cloudflare Workers product.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of our global network and products. Our R&D team's structure allows us to build a broad swath of products while continuing to innovate. One group works closely with our product management organization to improve, refine and expand our existing products. A second independent group builds greenfield opportunities that aim to expand our market and reach new markets. In addition, our research team is focused on ensuring that our network, products, and customers are secured with the latest cryptography.
We prioritize investment in research and development. Those investments have continued to result in the launch of new products that have helped us attract new customers and sell more products to our existing customers.
Sales
We have a multi-pronged go to market approach that allows us to efficiently serve the needs of very small to very large customers. By using a combination of web sales, direct sales, and indirect sales, we are able to serve the greatest diversity of customers across all sizes.
We sell our pay-as-you-go plans through our website and hosting partners where a customer can either start on a free or paid plan and, as we demonstrate value, upgrade over time. Our pay-as-you-go customers are able to sign up for our Pro or Business plans that are payable monthly. Pay-as-you-go customers are able to onboard and customize our products through our website and pay for their subscription using a credit card. Our automated and easy to use process enables us to efficiently onboard thousands of new customers per day without requiring any interaction with our sales team. As pay-as-you-go customers evolve their usage of our products, some upgrade to an Enterprise plan for greater control, higher service levels, or productivity-related tools.
We sell our Enterprise plan directly through our technically-oriented inside and field sales teams, and also indirectly through our ecosystem of partners. Our Enterprise plan customers, which we refer to as our contracted customers, typically are replacing on-premise hardware with cloud network services, or consolidating multiple existing cloud services onto one global cloud services provider with Cloudflare. For large contracted customers, our relationships often start with a portion of the customer’s overall network needs and expand over time as they consolidate other vendors’ services and increase their adoption of our products.
Marketing
Our marketing aims to clearly communicate the value of our offerings to a large and diverse set of global customers at scale. We drive organic awareness and adoption of our products by providing a free offering that enables millions of users to experience the benefits of our global network before they adopt our pay-as-you-go offerings or contract for our Enterprise plan. We engage with developers across blogs, social media, and other channels to help build our brand and visibility among technical communities. In addition, our consumer products, including 1.1.1.1 and Warp, provide an effective and differentiated marketing channel to expand the awareness of our brand. 
We invest in a variety of targeted digital and non-digital marketing activities and programs to build awareness, engage with prospects, and build pipeline for our global sales teams. We also share stories of how large customers are rapidly adopting our services across use cases, industry verticals, and geographies, to communicate customer trust and our market momentum.
Competition
We compete in the market for network services primarily across three categories:
•On-premise network hardware vendors such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Riverbed Technology, Inc., and Broadcom Inc. We compete with these companies to provide security, performance, and reliability services. We believe we are positioned favorably against these vendors with our 
cloud-based, multitenant approach that is better suited to an increasingly cloud-based world and that allows customers to treat our services as operational as opposed to capital costs.
•Point-cloud solution vendors in various categories including cloud security vendors (such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), and Menlo Security, Inc.), CDN vendors (such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast), DNS services vendors (such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, Neustar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation), and cloud SD-WAN vendors. These providers are all focused on delivering point-cloud solutions. However, customers are increasingly looking for an integrated infrastructure platform offering security, performance, and reliability through a single vendor.
•A subset of services provided by traditional public cloud vendors such as Amazon.com, Inc. through Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc. through Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Corporation through Azure, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited through Alibaba Cloud. We believe customers want the ability to set a consistent policy across their on-premise, cloud, hybrid, and SaaS vendors, and be able to enforce that policy through an independent and integrated services provider. Customers are concerned about being locked in to any one public cloud provider. Our ability to efficiently and inexpensively move data between multiple clouds allows our customers to pick and choose the best from any cloud provider without fearing lock-in. Furthermore, unlike some public cloud providers, our business model aligns fully with the interests of our customers. We do not sell user data. We do not aim to compete with our customers.
As we open our serverless platform to third-party developers, we believe we will increasingly compete with public cloud vendors for storage and compute workloads. Because of the efficiency of our Cloudflare Workers product, we are able to offer it at prices that are highly competitive with public cloud vendors, and because it is distributed across our entire network, it enables the development of applications that were not previously possible on the traditional public cloud.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:
•breadth of network and product features and continued innovation;
•integrated solutions across security, performance, and reliability;
•unified control plane across on-premise, cloud, hybrid, and SaaS infrastructure;
•performance, availability, and effectiveness;
•network scalability;
•total cost of ownership;
•ease of adoption and use;
•global network coverage;
•quality of customer support;
•programmability and extensibility of platform; and
•independence, reputation, and trust.
We believe that we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these principal competitive factors.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2440 full-time employees, including approximately 975 employees located outside of the United States. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Our Culture
A healthy company culture has been a critical part of our success. In order to preserve our culture, we define performance by both results and behaviors. These behaviors — which we call Cloudflare capabilities — are clearly defined, and we use them as part of our hiring, performance, and promotion decisions:
•Be curious to learn and grow
•Communicate clearly, directly and transparently
•Do the right thing
•Embrace diversity to make Cloudflare better
•Get your work across the finish line
•Lead with empathy and assume good intentions
We want everyone at Cloudflare to have rewarding careers so we invest in development opportunities, aligned with both behaviors and results, to build leadership skills across the company, at all levels.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that attracting, motivating, and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our success. Our total rewards programs are built to engage employees, provide support, and encourage career best performance. Through programs that drive employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support customers and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. We provide our employees with competitive salaries, opportunities for equity ownership, and a comprehensive benefits package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, life and disability insurance, financial savings, family forming and caregiving benefits, and flexible vacation time. We also offer remote-friendly and flexible work schedules, which allows us to draw from a much larger talent pool and provides potential and current employees with additional opportunities to grow their careers at Cloudflare, while also providing environmental and other benefits.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe that much of our innovation and success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We have fostered an inclusive culture through the development of employee-led communities, educational offerings, incorporating behaviors into performance, and reviews of our processes and policies for fairness and inclusion. In recognition of our inclusive culture, we were named one of Human Rights Campaign's 2021 Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. We remain committed to extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our global workforce. 
We value diversity at all levels and are committed to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. We work with our managers to develop strategies for increasing the diversity of their teams and ensuring inclusion, equity, and fairness. An important component of our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy is to grow a diverse talent pool, and we have established recruiting partnership programs with various organizations to reach underrepresented groups. We are focused on understanding our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities in order to execute a strategy to support further progress.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, contractual provisions, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had 180 issued patents and more than 75 pending patent applications in the United States and abroad. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2030 and 2040, and cover various aspects of our network and products. In addition, we have registered “Cloudflare” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions and we have filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Cloudflare” (including “Cloudflare.com”). 
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further seek to control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription agreements.
