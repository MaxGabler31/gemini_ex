Vidable™

Vidable™ will be an integrated collection of AI-powered video analysis and enhancement tools designed to operate at enterprise scale. In today’s enterprise environment, video is everywhere. With so much content being created and shared, traditional tools and processes for managing video cannot keep up. With today’s cutting-edge advancements in AI and ML technology, it’s possible to achieve in minutes, or seconds, what would have previously required days or weeks of painstaking effort. Vidable assembles the most applicable and functional AI video capabilities and delivers access to those tools through a single integrated platform. From simple AV quality edits like audio clean-up, background blurs, and lighting correction, to engagement-oriented enhancements like summaries and quizzing, Vidable can provide users with an all-in-one pipeline for enhancing the quality, accessibility, and engagement value of their entire video library. 
Global Learning Exchange™ 
 
Global Learning Exchange™ (GLX) provides students in emerging countries access to higher education in flexible, cost effective, locally supported environments. GLX plans to open “hubs” in target countries, which will serve as support centers where local students can study, network with other students, obtain Wi-Fi access and receive educational and career support from a local hub team.  
 
The Global Learning Exchange launched and opened its first hub in Nassau, Bahamas in July 2022 and has begun enrolling students. In September 2022, GLX announced a partnership with UNESCO’s Read and Earn Federation to launch and promote a Nigeria-based education and skills development program. This partnership is expected to provide access and expedite enrollment of Nigerian higher ed students as GLX looks to expand into other markets. 
 
In 2022, Global Learning Exchange signed agreements with three US universities and one skill certification provider to provide students in emerging countries with access to coursework, certifications, and degrees. The number of education providers is expected to expand as new US and UK partners come onboard to provide additional educational offerings to students.

Our Expanded Service Offerings Address the New Virtual World  
 
Video Solutions (launched November 2022)
 Formerly known as Mediasite Events, Video Solutions was rebranded and relaunched with expanded offerings in 2022. Video Solutions specializes in comprehensive video services and is organized around a simple value proposition: We make video easy, period. Video Solutions technicians and project managers have decades of experience successfully planning, managing, and executing video initiatives for event organizers, associations, and companies around the world. Video Solutions plugs into organizations as needed – providing self-service tools or full-service offerings supported by expert technicians and project managers. From organizing video capture and distribution for an in person, live or hybrid event, to migrating an existing video content library to the cloud to planning and executing an organization's video strategy from start to finish, Video Solutions is a full service offering that is customized specifically to an organization’s needs and objectives.
Mediasite Professional Services
 Customers can maximize the value of their Mediasite instance and their video library with additional Mediasite Professional Services including integration services, installation assistance, custom development, training, cloud migration support and monitoring services.

Segment Information
 
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280-10, Segment Reporting, the Company has three operating segments; however, these segments meet the criteria for aggregation for reporting purposes as one reporting segment as of September 30, 2022.
 
Billings
 
Our services are typically billed and collected in advance of providing the service. Billings, which are a non-GAAP measure, are an important indicator of customer activity and cash flow in addition to revenue, and is therefore used by management as a key operational indicator. Billings are computed by combining revenue with the change in unearned revenue.
 
Our largest individual customers can be either value added resellers (“VARs”) or end users in the case of large higher education institutions. No single customer represented over 10% of billings or revenue in 2022 or 2021.
 
Sales
 
We sell and market our offerings through a sales force that manages a channel of value-added resellers, system integrators, and consultants. These third-party representatives specialize in understanding both audio/video systems and IT networking. We also sell to approximately 300 resellers, and over 1,150 total end users.
 
Market expansion:
 
Historically, over two-thirds of our revenue has been realized from the education market. However, COVID escalated the rapid adoption of video as a remote work and learning solution across all industry sectors. This development represents an exciting trend that can extend Sonic Foundry’s market opportunity beyond the traditional academic customer base into new verticals.
 
For our higher education as well as corporate, government and association clients, we anticipate economic conditions will expand market demand for more outsourced services versus licensed, on-premises sales. In recent years, the Company has made extensive capital and technology investments to advance its services model, expand its cloud datacenters, grow recurring revenue by migrating loyal customers to cloud multi-year agreements and diversifying its core offerings through expansion into adjacent growth markets. 
 
The company has also diversified its core offerings through expansion into adjacent markets with the launch of Video Solutions, Vidable™ and Global Learning Exchange™ in 2022.
 
Operations
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we contract with a third party to build the hardware for our Mediasite Recorders and purchase quantities sufficient to fill specific customer orders, including purchases of inventory by resellers. Quantities are maintained in inventory by the third-party provider and shipped directly to the end customer or reseller. The hardware manufacturer provides a limited one-year warranty on the hardware, which is passed on to our customers who purchase a Mediasite Customer Care support and maintenance plan. While we have long standing relationships with our contract manufacturer, there are other manufacturing alternatives if needed.

Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success will depend on our ability to deepen our relationship with current customers and attract new customers by offering a compelling value proposition that enhances their workplace and business objectives. Accordingly, we invest a significant amount of our resources in research and development activities, with a particular focus on our SaaS offerings. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we spent $7.6 million and $7.2 million, respectively, on internal research and development activities in our business. These amounts represent 28% in 2022 and 20% in 2021 of total revenue.
Global Expansion
 
In fiscal 2014, we acquired MediaMission B.V.in the Netherlands and Mediasite KK in Japan.  With these acquisitions, we significantly expanded our global market reach in Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region and accelerated our commitment to enterprise video communication worldwide.  The investment in maintaining a local presence in these regions has allowed us to better serve the ongoing sales and support demands of our customers and prospective customers in those markets. Additionally, we’ve been able to deploy customer care and cloud hosting services more quickly in each of those markets to capitalize on the trend to move data intensive applications, such as video, to the cloud.
Human Capital
 
At September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had 193 and 180 full-time employees, respectively. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
We have a competitive compensation plan and benefits plan that is designed to attract, retain, and reward individuals and includes an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k plan with a matching contribution. We offer 6 weeks of PTO and flexible work arrangements that encourage employees to achieve a comfortable work-life balance.
