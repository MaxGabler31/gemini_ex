ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Organizational History.
 
Gryphon Resources, Inc. (“Gryphon”, “We”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 16, 2006 under the name Gryphon Oil & Gas, Inc. On March 22, 2007, our name was changed to Gryphon Resources, Inc. to more accurately reflect the nature of our operations. At the time of the filing of our initial registration statement on Form SB-2 with the Securities & Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”) on or about April 25, 2007 our primary business focus was acquiring and exploring properties for the existence of commercially viable deposits of gold in Canada. On April 28, 2008 we incorporated a Turkish company named APM Madencilik Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi. (“APM”) as a 99% owned subsidiary. Thereafter, In July, 2010, we re-focused our operations and began mineral exploration in Arizona, USA and on September 27, 2010, sold our entire shareholdings in APM to an unrelated third party and ceased all operations in Turkey.  Thereafter focused on mineral exploration and continued exploring for gold, silver and copper-porphyry; and lithium on two different properties in the State of Arizona, USA. Following the filing of our Information Statement on May 15, 2009 with the Commission on DEF Schedule 14C, on May 26, 2009 we amended or Articles of Incorporation to increase our common stock from 100 million shares to 400 million shares, $0.001 par value, authorized for issuance. On May 3, 2012 prior management filed a termination of our registration statement on Form 15-12G pursuant to Rule 12g-4(a)1 and our termination went effective 90 days later on August 1, 2012 then on May 4, 2012 the Company was dissolved at the Nevada Secretary of State’s office and on August 28, 2018, its corporate charter was reinstated.   On February 21, 2018, one of the Company’s shareholders made a motion and application to be appointed as custodian of the Company based on prior management abandoning its responsibilities to continue making filings at the Nevada Secretary of State’s office and for failing to hold a shareholders’ meeting in over 6 years otherwise keep current in its obligations to the Company.  Upon motion and application to the District Court, Clark County Nevada, the Court granted the shareholder’s request and the shareholder was appointed as custodian for the Company (“Custodian”). As Custodian of the Company, the shareholder was ordered to file an amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation which was filed in conformity with N.R.S. 78.347(4) and the shareholder was ordered to have the Company’s charter reinstated in Nevada, to notice and hold a shareholder meeting; to provide a report to the Court of the actions taken at the shareholder meeting; to identify and name a new registered agent in the State of Nevada; to reinstate the Company in the State of Nevada and the Custodian is complying with the Court Order and will be filing a motion for termination of the Custodian which will be followed by an Order from the Court terminating the Custodian and acknowledging that the Custodian has complied with all of the requirements listed by the Court in its Order for Appointment. The Custodian was given the power and authority to take any action it deemed reasonable and for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. A Copy of the Order Appointing the Custodian was furnished with the Registration Statement as Exhibit 99.1 filed on July 5, 2019.   The Company has since been seeking a merger target and has been evaluating various opportunities.
