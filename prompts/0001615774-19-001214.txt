OVERVIEW 
 
Established in 1969, Advanzeon Solutions, Inc., (formerly Comprehensive Care Corp.) (“Advanzeon”, “we”, “Parent”, or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pharmacy Value Management Solutions, Inc., (“PVMS”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries during 2015, and partly in 2016, provided managed care services by acting as the administrator for certain administrative service agreements in the behavioral health and substance abuse fields. We primarily offered these services to commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) health plans, as well as self-insured companies. Our managed care operations consisted solely of servicing administrative service agreements. Starting in July of 2015, we implemented our comprehensive sleep apnea program, called “SleepMaster Solutions” ™. SleepMaster Solutions (“SMS”) utilizes an administrative system for the convenient identification/testing and therapy of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (“OSA”). We partnered with a national health care provider by initiating a sleep apnea wellness program whereby we screened, tested and when needed, offered a treatment programs for treating this disorder. We also contracted with a union to treat its driver members. Beginning in 2017, our only business was our SMS sleep apnea program.

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APENA
 
In 2014, the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) overhauled its system such that regulations now require commercial drivers, that is drivers with a commercial drivers licensee (‘CDL”) must be specifically examined with respect to whether or not they have a respiratory dysfunction which is defined to include Obstructive Sleep Apnea (“OSA”). OSA is a breathing disorder that causes the airway in a person’s throat to close during sleep for ten seconds or more. This loss of breathing function can occur as many as 400 times during the night, and those who have the disorder wake up multiple times, which can lead to exhaustion during the day. Although OSA is diagnosed across a wide demographic, there are certain factors that increase the risk of a person developing this disorder:

● | Obesity
--+--------


● | Smoking and drinking alcohol
--+-----------------------------


● | Family history
--+---------------


● | Small airway
--+-------------


● | Recessed chin, large overbite
--+------------------------------


● | Ethnicity
--+----------

 
The troubling aspect of OSA as it relates to CDL drivers is that it causes intense fatigue often causing a driver to struggle with focusing and remaining alert while driving. Sleep apnea is one of the major contributing factors in truck accidents.
 
SOURCES OF REVENUE 
 
During our fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and 2016, the majority of our revenue was from our managed care business. We provided managed care services by acting as the administrator for certain administrative service agreements in the behavioral health and substance abuse fields, so called Administrative Services Only (ASO”) contracts. Under our ASO contracts, we managed behavioral healthcare programs or perform various managed care functions, such as clinical care management, provider network development and claims processing without assuming financial risk for member behavioral healthcare costs. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, all of our revenue was earned from our sleep apnea business.
OUR BUSINESS
 
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary PVMS administers and operates a program known as SleepMaster Solutions™ (“SMS”). We believe our SMS program is the largest provider of these services in the USA. We are in all 50 states and provide a turnkey solution that effectively keeps drivers on the road with no down time, compliant with DOT regulations, improves their health, and significantly decreases liability risk for the employer. We are vertically integrated, and we provide a “Program” of services that addresses all the needs of a corporate transportation system. In October 2018, we announced the launch of a proprietary data collection, sorting and reporting software system. It is a state-of-the-art patient analytics management system (“PAM”). The PAM system provides our customers with the ability to collect, sort, analyze and effectively use information obtained from the screening, testing and treatment protocols employed with respect to its customer/employees population. We believe we are the only company capable of providing the full range of needed services in a timely manner. Other companies provide the component parts of this health care delivery system. We believe that we are the only company that provides, in one system, the complete range of services needed to treat OSA. In that regard, we consider our company to be transformative in this area of healthcare.

Our services start with the identification of the target population and the potential risk the client currently has. We do this through a screening of every driver to identify if signs and symptoms of sleep apnea are present. We take this data and provide the employer with a list of those drivers or in the case of our union drivers we communicate with the driver that should be tested and the statistical likelihood of the percentage of those drivers who will test positive for OSA. Together with the employer, SMS provides a realistic time frame, actual total cost, and process for testing all drivers who need to be tested. For those drivers testing positive for OSA, we then provide the appropriate treatment such that the driver will meet the DOT requirements and remain on the road. We monitor 365 days per year the driver’s usage of the treatment device according to DOT standards and we report that usage to all stakeholders as required/permitted. We utilize algorithms to determine if the driver is predicatively meeting the annual DOT requirements for usage. Using those predictive algorithms, we reach out to those drivers and provide case management, encouragement and solve problems such that the driver increases usage, if necessary, and remains compliant.
 
SMS constructed its model based upon the foregoing principles. The SMS Program includes all processes attended in sleep apnea screening, testing, treatment, monitoring and overall management of commercial drivers’ as well as their employers’ needs. We have successfully established relationships with national health care clinic providers, all with certified medical examiner (“CME”) status. These clinics total almost 1,000 throughout the U.S. We also have both formal and informal relationships with employers; municipalities; a significant veteran’s group; union and non-union driving organizations; suppliers of home sleep testing equipment and a variety of OSA treatment devices; and, a national network of telemedicine sleep specialists covering all 50 states. We have an internal medical team for governance and protocol purposes and a customer service department that interfaces directly with our drivers.  We also have a marketing team that regularly interfaces with our existing accounts and markets our services to potential new accounts. Our services are performed utilizing a best medical practices model and an efficient, cost-effective delivery system. We obtain the required equipment on a per order basis from a durable medical equipment distributor.
 
Our Home Sleep Test (HST) Process:
 
After a driver has been diagnosed as at risk for OSA, the next step is for the driver to evaluated with a Home Sleep Test “(HST”). The HST is a testing device used overnight by the driver. The device takes readings of the sleep interruptions, oxygen levels and other related data. SMS contacts the driver and coordinates where to send the Home Seep Test. The driver is advised what will come in the box and when the box will arrive. SMS then ships the test along with a return shipping box. When the test is completed, the driver places the device in the return box. The driver then calls USPS for a free pickup or drops off the box at a USPS location. The test is then returned to SMS where the test is downloaded, results evaluated by a certified sleep specialist, and a report generated. We coordinate with our supplier and provide the HST and related services to the driver for a fee.
 
CPAP Therapy:
 
Once the HST Is returned and results evaluated, the driver falls into one of two categories. If sleep apnea is ruled out, the driver and all relevant stakeholders are provided with a “Certificate of Compliance” which is used by the CME to certify the driver’s medical card. If sleep apnea is confirmed, the driver and all relevant stakeholders are advised, and a medically correct and regulatory compliant treatment plan is recommended. This plan is most often Continuous Positive Air Pressure “(CPAP”) therapy. SMS will provide the driver with an auto regulating CPAP machine and deliver same to the driver’s home, office, or wherever he/she prefers to receive it. The driver is instructed on how to use the CPAP machine and preferences for mask type, fitting size, etc. are customized for the driver. SMS employs staff who is skilled at walking a driver through the process. SMS also utilizes a “hot line” that a driver may call with any questions.

Monitoring:
 
SMS provides monitoring of drivers for compliance as required by the DOT. There are two phases of monitoring. For those drivers determined to require CPAP therapy, an initial thirty day report is required to demonstrate that the driver is using the CPAP machine at least 70% of the time. SMS not only monitors the driver, but actively intervenes with the driver to encourage compliance. SMS utilizes an algorithm based on current usage to predict if the driver will meet compliance guidelines. If our monitoring indicates the driver is not meeting guidelines, we alert them and offer suggestions and encouragement to help them meet compliance. At the conclusion of the thirty day period, SMS provides a DOT appropriate report documenting compliance performance. SMS also provides ongoing monitoring via a WIFI-based model to monitor the driver’s usage 24/365. We provide the same case management function of encouraging compliance and offering solutions to keep the driver healthy, safe, compliant and on the road.

OUR ADVISORY BOARDS
 
Medical Advisory Board.
 
Our SMS program is a medically-driven program dedicated to the concept that by attacking and containing root causes of various ailments affecting our population, we can dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare; increase workplace productivity; decrease and, in many cases, eliminate unnecessary expenses; and, provide for a healthier population, both in and out of the workplace. The primary focus of our Medical Advisory Board panel in regard to the foregoing is sleep apnea.
 
The Medical Advisory Board consists of 33 members at present and is composed of members with specialties and sub-specialties specifically selected so that it can address all of the various sleep-disorder breathing co-morbidities. Some of the practices represented on the Board include cardiovascular, pathology and diabetes The Board meets at least twice a year, and more often as needed. Management consults with individual members on an as needed basis. The Medical Advisory Board furthers the SMS program mission to perform its services utilizing a best medical practices model and an efficient, cost-effective delivery system.
 
Dental Advisory Board.
 
The Dental Advisory Board meets jointly with the Medicinal Advisory Board. With the expansion of dental practice into the areas of detection and treatment of OSA the Board advises management on advances and new solutions for the treatment of OSA. It presently has three members.
MARKETING AND SALES 
 
Our marketing and sales efforts are led by our management. In addition, we utilized independent sales agents for direct sales to commercial, CHIP health plans, health care providers as well as self-insured companies and unions. We enter into written agreements with these sales agents whereby we pay a base amount of compensation plus a commission amount. We currently have three such agents. Our customer service operations and telemarketing efforts are handles by independent contractors. We pay these contractors a set amount of compensation. We currently have four such contractors.
COMPETITION
 
We operate in a very competitive but highly fractured health care environment. There are traditional sleep test centers that have operated for a long time and are well established. The services provide by such centers are most often covered by insurance. Our services are not generally covered by insurance as we are not presently credentialed to be able to accept insurance. Once a person has been diagnosed with OSA there are a number of ways that equipment may be obtained. Again, insurance may cover the purchase of such equipment. Equipment for the treatment of OSA is readily obtainable from many sources including the internet. In addition, there are a number of devices advertised that claim to treat OSA without the need for CPAP equipment. We believe that our SMS Program is the only medically driven comprehensive program that provides the customer/employer with a turnkey solution from initial screening through testing, when required, treatment and ongoing compliance monitoring.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
We are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”). One of the purposes of HIPAA is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system through standardization of the electronic data interchange of certain administrative and financial transactions and, also, to protect the security and privacy of protected health information. Entities subject to HIPAA include some healthcare providers and all healthcare plans.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 
All of our OSA information technology and systems operate on a single platform. This approach avoids the costs associated with maintaining multiple systems and improves productivity. The open architecture of the systems gives us the ability to transfer data from other systems thereby facilitating the integration of new health plan business. We use our information system for customer processing, utilization management, reporting, cost trending, planning, and analysis. The system also supports customer and provider service functions.
 
We significantly enhanced our network by installing a storage area network and virtualizing our computer servers. This implementation brought in the current best practices approach and permitted a major overhaul of our information technology infrastructure. The technology centralizes storage management, increases the utilization of equipment, improves redundancy of the servers, reduces the overall hardware requirements, and facilitates growth, while driving down the total cost of ownership.
 
ADMINISTRATION AND EMPLOYEES 
 
Our executive and administrative offices are located in Tampa, Florida, where we maintain operations, business development, accounting, reporting and information systems, and provider and customer service functions. During 2015, we employed six people and contracted for three others. During 2016, we employed three people and contracted for nine others. During 2017, we employed three people and contracted for nine others. We currently employ two people and contract for nine others.
