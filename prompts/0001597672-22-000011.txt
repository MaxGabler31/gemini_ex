Item 1. | Business

We are a global leader of cellulose-based technologies, which comprise a broad offering of high purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer commonly used in the production of specialty chemicals and polymers for use in producing liquid crystal displays, filters, textiles and performance additives for pharmaceutical, food and other industrial applications. Starting from a tree and building upon more than 95 years of experience in cellulose chemistry, we provide high quality high-purity cellulose pulp products that make up the essential building blocks for our customers’ products while providing exceptional service and value.  We also produce unique, lightweight paperboard and a bulky, high-yield pulp for use in consumer products. 
Additionally, we have made strategic investments in projects with sustainability benefits, including  renewable energy projects at our Temiscaming facility in Quebec, Canada and our Tartas, France facility; TemSilk™, a high-purity product that helps our customers produce a more environmentally friendly product known as Lyocell; and Anomera, Inc., a company that manufactures carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), a patented, biodegradable product for use as an ingredient in cosmetics and various industrial materials . We have also recently launched a project at our Tartas facility to produce second-generation (“2G”) bioethanol to help meet the demand for Europe’s fast-growing biofuels market. With production expected to begin mid-2023, we expect to be among the first in France to produce wood-based 2G bioethanol fuel. Our 2G bioethanol product is expected to help petrochemical companies improve the climate profile of their energy offerings in the European market.

Prior to June 27, 2014, we consisted of Rayonier Inc.’s (“Rayonier’s”) wholly-owned performance fibers business which was engaged primarily in the production of cellulose specialties. On that date, we separated from Rayonier and started our business as an independent, publicly traded company. In November 2017, we completed the acquisition of Tembec Inc. (the “Acquisition”) which manufactured cellulose specialties, as well as lumber, paperboard, newsprint and high-yield pulp. 
In November 2019, we sold the Matane pulp mill (the “Matane Mill”), which was acquired in the Acquisition. As a result of the sale, the Matane Mill’s operating results and assets and liabilities for prior periods are shown as discontinued operations. In August 2021, we sold the lumber and newsprint assets in Ontario and Québec Canada, that we had acquired in the Acquisition. As a result of the sale, the lumber and newsprint operating results as well as the assets and liabilities included in the sale are shown as discontinued operations for prior periods. See Note 3 — Discontinued Operations of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Following the sales of the Matane Mill and the lumber and newsprint operations, we report the following business segments and all prior period disclosures have been conformed to this segment structure:
•High Purity Cellulose
•Paperboard
•High-Yield Pulp
See Note 20 — Segment and Geographical Information of our consolidated financial statements for more information.
High Purity Cellulose
The High Purity Cellulose segment, and in particular the cellulose specialties product line, is the primary driver of our profitability. Cellulose specialties are natural polymers, used as raw materials to manufacture a broad range of consumer-oriented products such as liquid crystal displays, impact-resistant plastics, thickeners for food products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cigarette filters, high-tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses, food casings, paints and lacquers. We manufacture products tailored to the precise and demanding chemical and physical specifications of our customers, achieving industry-leading purity and product functionality. Our ability to consistently manufacture high-quality cellulose specialties products is the result of our proprietary production processes, intellectual property, and over 95 years of technical expertise and knowledge of cellulosic chemistry.
In addition to cellulose specialties, a significant portion of our production capacity is dedicated to manufacturing high-purity commodity products for viscose and absorbent materials applications. Commodity viscose pulp is a raw material required for the manufacture of viscose staple fibers which are used in woven applications such as rayon textiles for clothing and other fabrics, and in non-woven applications such as baby wipes, cosmetic and personal wipes, industrial wipes and mattress ticking. Absorbent materials, typically referred to as fluff fibers, are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers, feminine hygiene products, incontinence pads, convalescent bed pads, industrial towels and wipes and non-woven fabrics. Cellulose specialties typically contain over 95 percent cellulose, while commodity products typically contain less than 95 percent cellulose.
Our specialized assets, capable of creating the world’s leading high purity cellulose products, are also ideally suited for generating biofuels, bioelectricity and other biomaterials such as lignin and tall oils. For example, we have recently launched a 2G bioethanol project in our Tartas, France facility to serve Europe’s fast-growing biofuels market. This project will capture residual sugars from our existing pulp process and improve the sustainability of our operating model. Commercial sales of this 2G bioethanol are targeted to begin in mid-2023, under a long-term offtake agreement with a large international petrochemicals company.
Products
Cellulose Specialties
Cellulose specialties are a natural polymer primarily derived from either wood or cotton and are used as a principal raw material to manufacture a broad range of products. Cellulose specialties generally command a price premium and earn higher margins relative to other commodity wood pulp products. Cellulose specialties are a dissolving wood pulp product which target a combination of high purity and high viscosity. Unlike other wood pulps used for their physical properties, cellulose specialties are sought after for the unique chemical properties and reactivity they impart to downstream products. 
Derived from wood, our cellulose specialties require high levels of purity, consistency and process knowledge. Our products play a significant role in our customers’ manufacturing processes, which require cellulose specialties of high purity and uniformity for efficient production. Therefore, our customers demand products of the highest quality. As a result, our products are custom-engineered and manufactured to each customer’s unique specifications and require a stringent qualification process, and our quality and consistency allow our customers to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively.
One of our key competitive advantages is our unique ability to leverage our global manufacturing asset base to provide our customers greater supply chain security for cellulose specialties fibers. With our four facilities and five manufacturing lines capable of producing cellulose specialties, we are the only cellulose specialties producer in the world with flexibility to use both hardwood and softwood fibers, kraft and sulfite cooking processes, and a variety of proprietary chemical treatments to provide customized product functionality. Additionally, we possess significant process knowledge: the understanding of wood fiber properties and their modification under a sequence of chemical processes, accumulated and developed over 95 years of practical application to satisfy a variety of customer needs. This process knowledge, combined with our manufacturing scale and flexibility and knowledge of customers’ applications and specifications, makes us the industry’s most adaptable modifier of cellulose fibers.
Commodity Products
We can shift our High Purity Cellulose segment manufacturing assets between commodity viscose pulp and absorbent materials production. Historically we have opted to participate in both markets and fluctuate production to take advantage of market conditions and generate the most attractive margins.
Commodity viscose pulp is primarily sold to producers of viscose staple fibers which in turn are used to manufacture rayon fibers which are widely used in the clothing and textile industries. Shifts in fashion styles and textile fiber blending have 
increased demand for viscose staple fibers. Additionally, variability in cotton linter supply and increasing environmental concerns about cotton production have resulted in viscose staple producers shifting volume away from cotton linter pulp to wood-based dissolving pulp.
Absorbent materials, or fluff fibers, are typically used in consumer products such as baby diapers. These fibers provide a medium for fluid acquisition, distribution and retention in the products in which they are incorporated. Pricing for commodity products is typically referenced to published indexes or based on publicly available spot market prices.
Competition
Cellulose Specialties
Significant intellectual property, capital investment and technical expertise are needed to design and manufacture customized cellulose specialties fibers to exacting customer specifications. The product must be formulated to achieve the desired characteristics including parameters for purity, viscosity, brightness, reactivity and other physical properties. Product qualification time can be lengthy, extending six to twenty-four months. Customer relationships are typically long-term and based on an understanding of the customer’s production processes and on technical expertise, which we utilize to help us solve our customers’ production challenges and support new product development. Establishing a production line and obtaining the necessary production technologies requires substantial capital and ongoing maintenance expenditures.
Product performance and customization, technical service and price are principal methods of competition in cellulose specialties. Product performance is primarily determined by the chemical attributes of the pulp, including purity, viscosity and uniformity of the cellulose specialties. Our processes, which are a key element of our intellectual property, are capable of generating cellulose specialties purity levels in excess of 98 percent as well as the highest levels of viscosity derived from wood pulp. Typically, product pricing is set annually in the fourth quarter for the following year based on discussions with customers and the terms of contractual arrangements.
We compete with both domestic and foreign producers in cellulose specialties. Our competitors include GP Cellulose, Borregaard, Bracell, Sappi, Nippon, Cosmo Specialty Fibers and Aditya Birla Group. Some competitors use both wood and cotton linter fibers, as a source of cellulose fibers. Our multiple manufacturing lines, processes and intellectual property allow us to compete in more segments of the cellulose specialties market than any of our competitors.
Commodity Products
The principal method of competition in commodity products is price, as purity and uniformity are less critical differentiators. We compete with both domestic and foreign producers of commodity products.
For commodity viscose pulp, many competitors derive their commodity viscose pulp from either wood or cotton. Although cellulose specialties can generally be sold to meet commodity viscose demand, the reverse is not typically true. However, in recent years commodity viscose pulp has continued to supplant cotton as the preferred raw material input for viscose staple fiber production. For commodity viscose pulp, our major competitors include Sappi, Austrocell and Bracell.
For absorbent materials, our major competitors include GP Cellulose, Domtar, International Paper and Klabin.
Paperboard
We manufacture paperboard in the Temiscaming plant in Quebec, Canada. Paperboard is used for printing documents, brochures, promotional materials, packaging, paperback book or catalog covers, file folders, tags, and tickets. Pricing for paperboard is typically referenced to published indices and marketed through our internal sales team. Our production facility has the capacity to annually produce 180,000 metric tons of paperboard.
Products
Products in the Paperboard business include packaging, printing documents, brochures, promotional materials, paperback book or catalog covers, file folders, tags and tickets.

Raw Materials and Input Costs
All our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of wood fiber, in the form of logs or wood chips, as a raw material and energy to produce our products. Additionally, our High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp segments’ manufacturing processes require significant amounts of chemicals. These raw materials and input costs are subject to significant changes in prices as a result of weather conditions, supply and demand. To control cost, we continually pursue reductions in usage and costs of key supplies, services and raw materials. 
Wood
We procure wood chips for our High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp plants through the purchase of chips from lumber producers or the production for chips from roundwood at our own wood chipping facilities. Prices for wood are impacted by various factors including supply and demand, weather events, transportation costs for delivery and overall economic conditions.
Chemicals
Chemicals, which include caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), sulfuric acid, ammonia, sodium chlorate and various specialty chemicals, are purchased under negotiated supply agreements with third parties. The prices for these products are impacted by various factors including supply and demand, environmental regulation, energy prices and overall economic conditions.
Energy
Our energy is primarily produced through the burning of lignin and other residual biomass in recovery and power boilers located at our plants. However, our manufacturing facilities still utilize significant amounts of fuel oil, natural gas and purchased electricity to supplement their energy requirements. Our energy costs are also impacted by emission allowances purchased or sold at market prices during any given period. In addition, energy prices impact our transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities and delivery of our finished products to customers.
Intellectual Property
Substantially all of our intellectual property relates to our High Purity Cellulose segment. We own patents, trademarks and trade secrets, and have developed significant know-how, particularly in the production of high purity cellulose, but also in the 
production of paperboard, which we deem important to our operations. We intend to protect our intellectual property, including, when appropriate, filing patent applications for inventions that we deem important to our business and operations. Our U.S. patents generally have a duration of 20 years from the date of filing. We also require key employees to enter into non-compete agreements as appropriate.
