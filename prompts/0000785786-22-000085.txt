ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," "our", or "we") participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry. Since 1979, we have been partnering with companies to create the products that build a better world. We are a global leader with a team of nearly 25,000 individuals focused on providing Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Sustaining Services. We specialize in serving customers in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. We deliver customer service excellence to leading global companies in the Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense market sectors by providing innovative, comprehensive solutions throughout the product’s lifecycle. We provide these innovative solutions to customers in the Americas ("AMER"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") regions. 
Our Vision, Mission and Strategy
Our vision is to help create the products that build a better world. Our mission is to be the leader in highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. Our strategy to fulfill our vision and mission remains consistent and can be summarized in four parts: market focus, superior execution, passion meets purpose and discipline by design. 
•Market Focus – We engineer innovative solutions for customers in growth markets and focus on partnering with leading as well as disruptive global companies in the Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense sectors. 
•Superior Execution – Superior execution is foundational to our differentiation. We are dedicated partners to our customers, committed to achieving zero defects and perfect delivery through operational excellence. 
•Passion Meets Purpose – Through our collective passion, we drive purpose to our actions and decisions in pursuit of operational excellence. Guided by our values and leadership behaviors, we do the right thing to support our team members, communities and customers. 
•Discipline by Design – Finally, we are committed to delivering shareholder value over the long term through a consistent and disciplined financial model focused on driving industry-leading revenue growth and superior return on invested capital. 
To deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create a high performance, accountable organization with a talented and engaged workforce deeply passionate about driving growth through customer service excellence. We also promote a collaborative, customer-centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes with a goal of creating shareholder value. Finally, we execute to customer-driven and sector-based go-to-market strategies.
Financial Model 
Our financial model aligns with our business strategy. Our primary long-term focus is to achieve a 9-12% compounded annual revenue growth rate while earning a return on invested capital ("ROIC") of 15%, which would exceed our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") and represent positive economic return. Economic return is the amount by which our ROIC exceeds our WACC, and we believe it is a fundamental driver of shareholder value. We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2022, our WACC was 9.3%. For more information regarding ROIC and economic return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return" in Part II, Item 7. For a reconciliation of ROIC and economic return to our financial statements that were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
Operations 
Plexus is a Wisconsin-headquartered corporation with nearly 25,000 employees, including over 4,700 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 28 active facilities, totaling approximately 5.1 million square feet. Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing and sustaining service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
Go-to-Market Strategy
We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the three market sectors we serve, Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and 
Aerospace/Defense. Each sector has a market sector vice president, as well as business development and customer management leaders who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer managers and directors, supply chain, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts. These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market’s unique delivery, quality and regulatory requirements. 
Our market sector teams help define Plexus’ strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-add solutions we offer customers. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding our engagements with existing customers. We believe our ability to provide a full range of services that complement the entire product lifecycle across a global footprint provides a business advantage. 
Solutions
With integrated design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and sustaining services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. It is how our teams strive to create innovative and efficient paths to get products to market.

•Design and Development – Plexus was established with engineering as a core competency and has built a reputation for success. Our customers are able to partner with a collaborative team of over 640 development engineers to create new products. Using the same tools and processes throughout our seven Design Centers worldwide, we leverage the latest technology and state-of-the-art design automation methodologies to provide comprehensive new product development and product commercialization solutions. 
•Supply Chain Solutions – Delivering an optimal supply chain solution is more than simply getting a product where it needs to be on time. We take a unique approach. Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus’ integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain optimization early in the design stage. At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable solution for our customers. 
•New Product Introduction – When introducing a new product, customers need to move quickly. Plexus offers a dedicated team focused on decreasing time to market with a full suite of integrated new product introduction services. Through early integration and collaboration, customers can take advantage of Plexus’ capabilities, such as design for excellence, specialized design of test solutions and rapid prototyping, while the program is advanced by a dedicated Plexus team that supports a transition to volume manufacturing. 
•Manufacturing – Our approach to manufacturing focuses on innovation, continuous improvement and superior quality and delivery. With a global footprint and scalable operations, we aim to tailor our manufacturing environment to meet each customer’s needs worldwide. As we strive for zero defects, we empower all employees with the knowledge that exceptional quality begins with each individual member of our team. We believe our capabilities and our culture position us to support the complex technology and regulatory needs of the industries we serve and to provide customers with innovative and dependable manufacturing services.
•Sustaining Services – Plexus Sustaining Services is committed to protecting our customers' brand reputation, supporting the success of each customer's product in the marketplace and extending a product's end of life, while helping to minimize the impact of their products on the environment. From influencing a product design, which creates early access for lifecycle extension services and repair, to spare parts management and distribution, depot repair and refurbishment services, Plexus’ Sustaining Services offers a full range of capabilities in all regions in which we operate. 
We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we typically procure all materials required for product assembly. We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly. In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services. Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
Regulatory Requirements
All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015. We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ("FDA") Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries. 
We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:

 | AMER | APAC | EMEA

Customers and Market Sectors Served
Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies. During fiscal 2022, we served approximately 140 customers. General Electric Company ("GE") accounted for 12.9%, 11.2% and 11.7% of our net sales during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions. Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations. The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector. Many of our large customers, including GE, contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations. We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:

Industry | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Industrial* | 46% | 46% | 45% 
Healthcare/Life Sciences | 41% | 39% | 37% 
Aerospace/Defense | 13% | 15% | 18% 
Total net sales | 100% | 100% | 100%

*Fiscal 2020 has been revised to reflect the consolidation of the Industrial/Commercial and Communications sectors into the Industrial sector in fiscal 2021.
Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors of Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments). Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and, aside from the specific go-to-market teams, generally we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor do we internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with other technology pioneering start-ups and emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including FDA approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices and other government and regulatory processes. Plexus may benefit from increasing trends by original equipment manufacturers to outsource the design, manufacture and service of their products.
Materials and Suppliers
We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from a wide variety of manufacturers and their authorized distributors. Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from independent distributors, customers or competitors. Many of these raw materials are unique to the designed assembly. By customer agreement, we purchase materials according to customer forecast and supplier lead-times. 
The key electronic components we purchase include: advanced semiconductors, diodes, power management modules, microcontrollers, memory modules, interconnects, inductors, resistors, capacitors, power supplies and cable and wire. Component shortages, extended lead-times and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk within the electronics industry and have particularly been an issue for semiconductors during fiscal 2022. We discuss the causes, implications, and potential implications of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. 
We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered components such as molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components. These components are sourced from Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers. Altogether, purchased components range from “off the shelf” to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price. Through our engineering development engagements and through the quoting of new business, Plexus can influence the selection of new product components, and therefore the selection of suppliers who outperform their peers. 
Amidst a highly dynamic set of supply markets, Plexus' global supply chain management organization works to mitigate potential risks and ensure a steady flow of components at competitive prices. We pursue these goals through supply chain solutions developed in collaboration with our customers and our suppliers, a commitment to strong supplier partnerships, use of proprietary risk management tools and aggressive management of supplier commitments. 
Competition
Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers. With integrated design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and sustaining services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. A number of competitors may provide services similar to Plexus. Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources. Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas. Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers. Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities in order to remain highly competitive within our target markets.
Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, production flexibility, unique fulfillment requirements and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
Intellectual Property
We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries. Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business. We do not have any material copyrights.
Information Technology
Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system in addition to product data management and advanced planning and scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution that support our global operations. This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize the translation of data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business. The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements. In addition, by taking advantage of virtualization technology, we are able to realize gains in efficiency and up-time supporting our critical operations.
We strive to promote innovation technologies, solutions and processes within our information technology ("IT") infrastructure to enable Plexus to differentiate from our competition. As technology solutions continue to evolve, so do the myriad of risks introduced to the organization. The delivery of business value through technology is highly dependent on the holistic identification and management of information technology risks. Plexus deploys a robust IT Risk Management Program that promotes data-driven decision making through a collaborative effort to improve IT and cybersecurity resiliency, including a governance framework that facilitates awareness, oversight accountabilities and risk management activities across the business. This framework includes oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s governance and management of information technology risks, including those relating to business continuity,
cybersecurity, regulatory compliance and data management. Plexus also utilizes an executive-level IT Steering Committee as well as an IT Cybersecurity Incident Response Team, and has a formal incident response plan in the event of a cyber incident.
Continuously enhancing our environment to meet the increasing needs of cybersecurity and privacy regulations remains a top priority. We discuss the risks relating to cybersecurity and their potential impact more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein.
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
As a global public company that supports manufacturing, designing and servicing highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments, our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and compliance obligations. We strive to implement robust internal controls, quality management systems and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also make efforts to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits, risk assessments as well as an ethics hotline reporting system.
We are also subject to a variety of regulations associated with environmental compliance, as well as those governing employee health and safety. These regulations are related to topics such as: monitoring, tracking and reporting of air and water emissions; handling and disposing of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process; and evaluating and mitigating employee health and safety hazards in our facilities. 
We believe that we are in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations, and we do not anticipate any significant additional expenditures related to maintaining our compliance. However, due to the sometimes rapidly evolving nature of these laws and regulations (including as a result of COVID-19), geopolitical complexity and uncertainty and changing requirements applicable to our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") program, there can be no assurance that current expenditures will be adequate or that violations will not occur. Any violations could result in fines, penalties, customer disengagements or reputational damage that may have a material impact on our financial performance. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, herein, for more detail around risks pertaining to compliance with laws and regulations. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
Consistent with our vision to help our customers create the products that build a better world, we are committed to building a better world by the way we innovate and operate. Plexus has established an ESG program that focuses on five key areas: (1) innovator; (2) responsible employer; (3) community partner; (4) global citizen; and (5) corporate governance.
•Innovator – We innovate for sustainability to solve today's challenges proactively while focusing on tomorrow's opportunities. Plexus is committed to environmental sustainability across our full value stream of solutions and we consider it an integral aspect of our "zero defect" culture. Integrated design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and sustaining services positions Plexus to systematically drive innovation, value and sustainability in support of a circular economy.
•Responsible Employer – We advocate for diversity, combat human trafficking, encourage and provide employee development opportunities, strive to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, promote an appropriate work/life balance for our employees, encourage wellness initiatives and reinforce responsible values in our culture.
•Community Partner – We promote and financially contribute to science, technology, engineering and mathematics ("STEM") programs, as well as causes that make a meaningful impact to the communities in which we operate. We encourage our employees’ involvement in community charitable organizations, as well as through our paid volunteer time off program, and we partner with community organizations to promote local business.
•Global Citizen – We actively work to reduce waste, water use and greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and work with suppliers to develop similar programs. We partner with customers to help design more efficient and 
environmentally friendly products as well as limit product end of life environmental impact through our sustaining services solution.
•Corporate Governance – Strong leadership and a culture of accountability are foundational at Plexus. Our executive management, in collaboration with our Board of Directors, competently and ethically manage Plexus’ operations for the long-term benefit of shareholders.
When we focus on improving outcomes for all of our stakeholders, we maximize our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and deliver long-term financial value for our shareholders. Plexus is committed to responsible business practices throughout our global operations. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), we have taken an active role in improving not only our own practices, but influencing and holding others accountable throughout our supply chain. In addition to RBA membership, we consider a variety of standards for responsible practices, including, but not limited to, local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") and the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
Human Capital Management 
We are driven to differentiate Plexus with our talent and by our culture. How we manage our human capital is critical to how we deliver on our strategy and create sustained growth and value for our shareholders.
Purpose and Culture
We recognize that a great culture is foundational to the success of our vision to create the products that build a better world. We are proud of our culture and the recognition we have received over the years as a great place to work. In building a great culture, we embrace four "non-negotiables":
•Our Values and Leadership Behaviors – Our Values and Leadership Behaviors establish the foundation upon which our culture is built, representing key expectations we have of our employees and emblematic of the work environment we strive to create. Our 10 Values and Leadership Behaviors are: Customer Focus, Relationships and Teamwork, Excellence, Open Communication, Integrity, Prioritize our People, Solve Problems, Be Courageous, Be Strategic and Innovate. 
•Quality Begins with Me – We instill personal responsibility for quality in our employees through our Quality Begins with Me culture, a commitment to delivering zero defects and continuous improvement. A culture concentrated on each individual’s pledge that quality is critical to achieving our strategic goal of superior execution in delivering highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. 
•5Es of Customer Service Excellence – Through the 5Es of Customer Service Excellence, we describe for our employees what is required to exceed our customer’s expectations and enable growth through customer service excellence. In all aspects of our engagements, with both internal and external customers, we reflect the 5Es: We are Empathetic, Entrepreneurial, Empowered, Engaged, and we Ensure Accountability.
•One Plexus – One Plexus reflects our sentiment that we are stronger together than the sum of our parts. We embrace the One Plexus mentality through collaboration to ensure consistent operations, globally, and leverage the strengths and best practices of all facets of the organization to drive the best solutions for our customers. 
Commitment to Values and Ethics
Along with our Values and Leadership Behaviors, we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics ("Code of Conduct"), which creates expectations and provides guidance for all employees and representatives of Plexus to make the right decisions. Our Code of Conduct includes topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting Code of Conduct violations. It is used to reinforce our passion for operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and articulates our responsibilities as a trusted leader in the business community. The Code of Conduct also emphasizes the importance of having an open, welcoming environment in which all employees feel empowered to do what is right and are encouraged to voice concerns should violations of the Code of Conduct be observed. All employees are required to complete the training on the Code of Conduct annually.
Human Rights
Plexus is dedicated to preserving and protecting human rights around the globe. Our Human Rights Policy formalizes Plexus' commitment to respect human rights and embodies principles reflected in the United Nations ("UN") Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, core International Labour to Organization Conventions, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the laws of the countries in which we operate. The foundation of our commitment to international human rights stems from our values of integrity and excellence and is reinforced in our Code of Conduct, our membership in the RBA and 
other Plexus policies and training. Our Human Rights Policy applies to all employees, representatives and contingent workers of Plexus and our subsidiaries as well as our business partners, including our supply chain. 
Diversity and Inclusion
At Plexus, diversity and inclusion ("D&I") does not simply mean representation. It means encouraging engagement, inclusion of all employees’ ideas and perspectives and association among the global locations in which we operate—proudly representing approximately 15 countries our team members call home. We have adopted the following D&I mission statement at Plexus, which is directly incorporated into our Code of Conduct: 
"Our people create our best Plexus. Ingrained in our culture of inclusion is the philosophy that each individual offers diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences that create great outcomes when we are united as a team. We respect our people and embrace our differences. We welcome everyone and value the ideas generated by our collective uniqueness. We aspire that all of our teammates reach their full potential and we encourage them to simply, BE YOU!"
Our strategy to enhance diversity at Plexus and to foster an inclusive culture includes the following:
•D&I Committee and Board Oversight – To oversee strategic objectives and to ensure appropriate accountabilities exist to support our diversity and inclusion efforts, our executive leadership committee structure includes a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, made up of key members of executive management, including our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the initiatives and results to cultivate a diverse workforce and inclusive culture. 
•Employee Resource Groups – Our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") are voluntary, employee-driven groups organized around common interests and legitimate business purposes. Plexus current ERGs include Plexus Young Professionals ("PYP"), UnusPlexus ("UP") and Women in Network ("WiN"). The goal of PYP is to create an environment that fosters collaboration and development for the young professionals at Plexus. UP's purpose is to celebrate the different cultures and diversity existing within Plexus. WiN has a mission to champion the advancement of women in their professional and personal development through various career and life changes. These groups are directly supported by executive-level leadership and management engages regularly in support of ERG programming. Plexus supports further expansion and enhancement efforts of existing ERGs as well as employee-driven creation of new ERGs.
•Mentoring & Training – Plexus has established a formal mentoring program that aids in the development and retention of diverse talent, with a specific focus on future leaders within our underrepresented populations. In addition, the Company has invested in D&I leadership training on the value of diversity and how best to foster an inclusive culture. This training focuses on enhancing understanding of unconscious bias and enhancing the skills to being an inclusive leader.
•Gender & Underrepresented Minorities Recruitment Strategy – Our talent acquisition teams have a strategic initiative to widen the funnel of talent seeking to join Plexus. Efforts in this space are customized by geography based on the current workforce dynamic. This includes partnerships with organizations such as Society of Women Engineering ("SWE"), universities with diverse student populations and minority groups supporting underrepresented minorities with leadership aspirations across many disciplines.
•Employee Benefits & Programs – Plexus has a number of policies and benefits in place to support the unique needs and overall wellbeing of our team members and their families, including flexible workplace, paid parental leave and a Plexus Wellness Program to ensure our employees have access to the resources they need to lead healthy, balanced lives. For our employees, this includes access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP), or similar program depending on country, which offers confidential support for managing stress and supporting mental health, including offering clinician, counselor, legal or financial resources to employees and members of their households.
•Community Involvement & Volunteerism – Community involvement, volunteering and charitable giving are important to ensure we are investing and promoting positive impacts in the communities in which we operate and where our employees live. We offer an employee charitable match program for employees located in our AMER and EMEA regions to use, with plans to expand to our APAC region. Plexus also offers employees paid, volunteer time off for team members who want to give back at qualified organizations or community events. 
Talent Development & Acquisition
In the pursuit of excellence, we nurture and grow our people. Our commitment to holistic talent management means that we expect and reward high performance and address underperformance with urgency, candor and empathy. Our team members receive and provide feedback with humility and a sincere interest to continuously improve. We engage in regular talent reviews to calibrate on the performance and potential of our teammates, their development needs, career pathing and the strength of our 
succession plans. During these reviews, we also assess retention rates and the diversity composition of our leaders. Competency-based training, leadership development programs and online learning provide the foundation for a learning culture and ongoing development for team members at all levels. While our goal is to develop our own talent, we recruit technical, new graduate and experienced talent by valuing potential as well as experience and personality traits that align with our Values and Leadership Behaviors.
Employee Engagement
At every facility, in every organization and at all levels, we strive to continuously improve the engagement of our teammates. We survey employee engagement annually through our employee net promotor score and we identify strengths and act on areas of opportunity to enhance our work environment and increase employee satisfaction. In 2022, we received responses from 95% of our team members through the survey.
Compensation
Our philosophy is to competitively compensate all employees for their contributions to Plexus and to appropriately motivate employees to provide value to Plexus' shareholders. To ensure compensation is competitive, performance-based and fair, we are disciplined in the way we establish and evaluate pay. We assign each role a pay range based on its job accountabilities and the pay practices for similar roles in the marketplace. Employees are compensated within their applicable pay range based on a number of factors, including the employee's education, experience, performance and potential. At least annually, we reevaluate employee pay based on these criteria. Short and long-term incentive pay is designed to be competitive, improve employee retention, reward employees for performance supporting our strategic objectives and align employees with the interests of shareholders to deliver both short-term and long-term results. Approximately 18% and 3% of our employees participate in our short and long-term incentive programs, respectively. 
Worker Rights, Health, and Safety
We are committed to complying with applicable laws, including those associated with labor and employment, across all areas of our operations. In addition, as an active member of RBA, we abide by their global standards, irrespective of legal requirements, regarding the treatment of workers. These include prevention of excessive working hours and unfair wages, controls to prohibit child labor and human trafficking and bolstering workplace health and safety measures. We are one of several companies actively partnering with the RBA to abolish human trafficking by holding foreign labor agencies accountable to upholding sound recruiting processes. 
Protecting our team members and those within our communities is essential. We strive to be the safest place for our employees away from home. Plexus takes an adaptive and proactive approach to ensure we conduct all of our operations across the globe safely and responsibly and we maintain a method of evaluating environmental, health and safety performance for continual improvement. This includes setting and reviewing environmental, health and safety goals. We are committed to providing a workplace that respects the health and safety of all those who work, visit or are contracted to provide a service in our facilities.
Human Capital Management Governance
As part of our governance structure, we have established an Organizational Performance Committee, an executive body comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President ("SVP") of Human Resources and other executives that oversee our human capital strategy. In addition, our SVP of Human Resources and other key leaders within our Human Resources organization provide a quarterly update to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board of Directors on our strategy for talent development and retention, including succession planning for key talent. This includes assessing the diversity of successor candidates for key management roles. Management also updates the Board of Directors regularly on employee-related policies and efforts intended to protect our employees and to preserve our corporate culture, such as the regular review of our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, diversity and inclusion initiatives, employee net promoter survey results and our ethics hotline activity. 
Employee Data
Of our nearly 25,000 team members, 49.9% are female, 50.0% are male and 0.1% choose not to identify. The majority of our workforce, 54.8%, is located in our APAC region, while 34.1% and 11.1% of our employees are located in our AMER and EMEA regions, respectively. Approximately 3,000 and 170 of our respective employees in Mexico and the United Kingdom are covered by union agreements. These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years. Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania, Thailand and the United States are not covered by union agreements. We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are positive and stable. Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency. To do so, we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
