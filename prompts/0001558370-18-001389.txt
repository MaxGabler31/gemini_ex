 Item 1.       Business
     Overview
     Our company provides a variety of post-secondary education and other academic programs through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Strayer University (the “University”) and the New York Code and Design Academy (“NYCDA”).
     Founded in 1892, Strayer University is an institution of higher learning that offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration, accounting, information technology, education, health services administration, nursing, public administration, and criminal justice at 71 physical campuses, predominantly located in the eastern United States, and online. Strayer University also offers an executive MBA online through its Jack Welch Management Institute (“JWMI”). For the 2017 fall term, we had 48,144 students enrolled in our programs. Strayer University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (hereinafter referred to as “Middle States” or “Middle States Commission”), one of the six regional collegiate accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (“Department of Education” or the “Department”). Middle States is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (267-284-5000). By offering its programs both online and in physical classrooms, the University provides its working adult students more flexibility and convenience. Strayer University, with its online offerings, attracts students from around the country and throughout the world.
     The New York Code and Design Academy provides non-degree courses in web and application software development, primarily at its campuses in New York City and in Philadelphia, PA. NYCDA is licensed by the New York Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision, but is not accredited and does not participate in state or federal student financial aid programs. We acquired NYCDA on January 13, 2016.
     On October 29, 2017, we entered into a merger agreement with Capella Education Company (“Capella”). Capella provides post-secondary education and job-skills programs primarily through its subsidiary Capella University. The merger was approved by our shareholders and by Capella’s stockholders on January 19, 2018. Upon consummation of the merger, Capella will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and will continue to offer its education programs through Capella University. Pursuant to the merger, we will issue 0.875 shares of Strayer Common Stock for each issued and outstanding share of Capella Common Stock, and outstanding equity awards held by current Capella employees and certain non-employee directors will be assumed by us and converted into comparable Strayer awards at the exchange ratio. Outstanding equity awards held by Capella non-employee directors who will not serve as directors of Strayer after completion of the merger and by former Capella employees will be settled in connection with completion of the merger in exchange for cash payments as specified in the merger agreement. Following the merger, Strayer and Capella stockholders are expected to own approximately 52% and 48%, respectively, of the outstanding combined company shares on a fully diluted basis, based on the number of shares currently expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Also, in connection with the completion of the merger and as approved by our shareholders on January 19, 2018, we will change our name to Strategic Education, Inc. and increase the number of shares of authorized Common Stock to 32,000,000. The merger is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approval by the Higher Learning Commission. 
     We generated net revenue of $455 million in 2017. For more information regarding our revenues, profits, and financial condition, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     Industry Background
     The market for post-secondary education is large, fragmented, and competitive. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, more than 20.4 million students attend approximately 7,000 post-secondary institutions in the United States. About 1.6 million students attend proprietary institutions. Controversy about the cost of higher education, under-employment of many college graduates, and persistent negative media coverage has caused some prospective students to question the value proposition of higher education. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, college enrollments in all higher education sectors declined 1.4% and 1.0% in fall 2016 and 2017, 

 
  5

 
respectively. Enrollment at proprietary colleges declined 14.5% and 7.1% in fall 2016 and 2017, respectively. The industry is heavily dependent on continued availability of funding for programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV programs”) and concerns about potential reductions in such funding also could negatively impact demand for higher education.
     Notwithstanding weaker demand dynamics over the past few years, we believe that over time, demand for post-secondary education will increase as a result of demographic, economic, and social trends. The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that approximately 62 million adults over the age of 25 in the United States do not have more than a high school education, and approximately 36 million adults over the age of 25 have some college experience but have not completed a college degree. Other trends that could positively impact demand for our programs include:
    
· | increasing demand by employers for certain types of professional and skilled workers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | growth in the number of high school graduates from 2.8 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated 3.6 million in 2017-2018, according to the National Center for Education Statistics;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the significant and measurable income premium and enhanced employment prospects attributable to post-secondary education;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a number of initiatives underway to reduce the cost of a post-secondary education; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continued demand from working adults for programs offered by regionally accredited institutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Company Strengths
     We have a track record of providing practical and convenient education programs and solutions for working adults and employers. We believe the following strengths position us to capitalize on the demand for post-secondary education:
· | Consistent operating history. Strayer University has been in continuous operation since 1892 and has demonstrated an ability to operate consistently and grow profitably.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Practical and diversified programs. We offer programs in practical areas of adult education. In order to keep pace with a changing knowledge-based economy, we constantly strive to meet the evolving needs of our students and their current and prospective employers by regularly refining, updating, and adding to our portfolio of educational programs. In January 2016, we acquired NYCDA, which offers non-degree courses in web and application software development that prepare students for high-demand jobs in software and web application development. In December 2011, Strayer University acquired the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online leadership education program that enables us to offer a differentiated executive MBA degree and executive certificates to students and employees of leading corporations. Across Strayer University and NYCDA, we currently offer approximately 100 different degree, diploma, certificate, and non-degree training programs and concentrations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on adults pursuing career-relevant degree and non-degree programs. We focus on serving adults who are pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as non-degree certificates and training programs that will help them advance their careers and employment opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexible program offerings. We maintain flexible programs that allow students to attend classes and complete coursework during the day, in the evening, and on weekends throughout the calendar year. Online programs offered through Strayer University enable students to take some or all of their classes via the internet. Approximately 85% of our students enrolled for the 2017 fall term were taking all of their courses online.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attractive and convenient campus locations. Strayer University’s campuses are located in growing metropolitan areas, mostly in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions where there are large populations of
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  6

 

adults with demographic characteristics similar to those of our typical students. Our campuses are attractive and modern, offering conducive learning environments in convenient locations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Established brand name and alumni support. With a 126-year operating history, Strayer University is an established brand name in post-secondary adult education, and our students and graduates work throughout corporate America. Our alumni network fosters additional referral opportunities for students.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Company Strategy
     Our goal is to be a leading provider of career-relevant education programs, primarily in the areas of business, accounting, information technology, and software development, that prepare students for advancement in their careers and professional lives. We have identified the following strategic priorities as key to achieving our goal:
· | Improve student success — Our success depends on the success of our students. The more we focus on helping our students succeed, the more likely it is that we will succeed. In order to improve student success, we must continue to hire outstanding faculty, produce high quality academic course content that engages and inspires students, and employ cutting edge technology innovations that enable us to deploy faculty and content in increasingly efficient and reliable ways.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhance student experience — Our students are predominately working adults who are furthering their education in order to advance their careers and professional lives. Our students are busy with work and family responsibilities that leave little time for other endeavors. Thus, we make every effort to make all interactions with our students productive, and we are constantly looking for ways to serve them better. This includes leveraging technology, including artificial intelligence and automation, to improve student service in the areas of advising, tutoring, registration, campus and online technology, and administration. We measure our performance through student surveys and focus groups.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Address affordability — The cost of a post-secondary education has increased substantially over the last decade while average earnings have only recently begun to increase. Recognizing that affordability is an important factor in a prospective student’s decision to further his or her education, in late 2013, we commenced an effort at Strayer University to make our degree programs more affordable. First, we introduced our Graduation Fund. Under this program, qualifying students enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program are eligible to receive one free course for every three courses successfully completed towards a bachelor’s degree. The free courses earned are redeemable in one’s final academic year. Furthermore, beginning the winter term 2014, we reduced undergraduate tuition for new students by 20%. In 2017, we began testing reduced tuition across several graduate degree programs in several different states. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of our affordability initiatives and explore other ways to make our offerings as affordable as possible. We have also begun to more aggressively deploy technology innovations, including artificial intelligence and automation, that enable us to lower our operating costs thus improving our ability to support lower tuition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish new platforms for growth — We are constantly looking for new ways to leverage our existing resources and capabilities to grow. Our acquisitions of the Jack Welch Management Institute in 2011, and NYCDA in 2016, represent continued opportunities to leverage our management capability and our physical campus and online infrastructure to accelerate growth. We continue to leverage the strong reputation and track record of Strayer University to develop new programs and concentrations like the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree, which received Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accreditation in mid-2017, and the Bachelor of Applied Science in Management, which began instruction in the Winter 2018 term. We also launched in 2017 the MBA in Digital Entreprenuership, a collaboration with Cheddar, a leading business news outlet that streams live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build a high performing culture — In order to be a leading provider of educational services, we must have talented and motivated faculty and employees who are passionate about serving students. We strive to attract the best talent and then develop and retain them. We want to be known as an employer of choice and be a place where one can build a long-term career.

In addition to our degree and diploma programs, we offer classes to non-degree and non-program students wishing to take courses for personal or professional enrichment.
     Although most of our programs are offered at our campuses and online, the University adapts its course offerings to the demands of the student population at each location. Strayer University students may enroll in courses at more than one campus and take courses online.

 Strayer University structures its curricula to allow students to advance sequentially from one learning level to another by applying credits earned in one program toward attainment of a more advanced degree. For example, a student originally pursuing an associate’s degree in information systems can extend his or her original educational objective by taking additional courses leading to a bachelor’s degree in information systems, and ultimately a master’s degree in information systems. This curriculum design provides students a level of competency and a measure of attainment in the event they interrupt their education or choose to work in their field of concentration prior to obtaining their final degree.
     Online
     Strayer University has been offering courses online since 1997. Currently, almost all students taking classes online choose the asynchronous format. Students may take all of their courses online or may take online courses in combination with classroom-based courses. A student taking classes online has the same admission and financial aid requirements, is subject to substantially the same policies and procedures, and receives the same student services and support as campus-based Strayer University students. Tuition for online courses is the same as campus-based courses.     Faculty
     The University appoints faculty who hold appropriate academic credentials, are dedicated, active professionals in their field, and are enthusiastic and committed to teaching working adults. In accordance with our educational mission, the University faculty focuses its efforts on teaching. The normal course load for a full-time faculty member is five courses per quarter for each of three quarters, or 15 courses per academic year. Further, many full-time faculty members participate actively in the University by providing leadership, developing the curriculum, setting academic policy, and serving on assessment committees.
     We provide financial support for faculty members seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge. The University maintains a professional development funding program that reimburses eligible faculty and deans for completing courses, continuing education, seminars, and various programs that enhance their current credentials and knowledge base to improve their content expertise. Full-time faculty (and all other full-time employees) receive a 90% discount for all Strayer University courses. The University also conducts annual in-house faculty workshops in each discipline. We believe that our dedicated and capable faculty is one of the keys to our success.
     Organization of Strayer University
     Overall academic and business decisions of the University, including review and approval of the annual financial budget, are directed by its Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees consists of Dr. Charlotte F. Beason, Chairwoman, and currently eight other members. The University By-Laws prescribe that a majority of members be independent from the University and Strayer Education, Inc. to assure independent oversight of all academic programs and services.

     Within the academic, strategic and financial parameters set by the Board of Trustees, the University is managed on a daily basis by the University President. The President is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the policies established by the Board of Trustees and is supported in this function by senior administrative officers, including the Provost/Chief Academic Officer and the Chief Operating Officer of the University. The majority of the University’s operations are centralized within the President’s Office or the University’s senior administrative staff offices. These operations include academic programs, academic intelligence, academic services, student affairs, academic records, accounting and auditing, human resources, operations, marketing, public relations, facilities, information technology, and regulatory compliance, including oversight of the University’s participation in federal student financial aid programs.
     Within this centralized structure, responsibilities fit within the purview of either the Provost/Chief Academic Officer or the Chief Operating Officer, both of whom report to the University President. The senior administrative officers that support the Provost/Chief Academic Officer in performing academic functions include six Academic Program Directors, a Vice President of Student and Faculty Resources, a Dean of Students in Student Affairs, a Vice President of Faculty, a Vice President of Institutional Research, and a Vice President for Content. Together, these individuals are responsible for faculty hiring and management, faculty development, curriculum development, student complaint resolution, policy oversight, student learning resources, and student learning outcomes. Each academic function receives further support from the University Registrar.
     Operational functions including Student Financial Services, Information Technology, and campus operations are the primary responsibility of the Chief Operating Officer of the University. Other senior administrative officers also support the President in areas such as legal compliance, accounting and auditing, computer technology, insurance, and human resources. All of the senior administrative officers collaborate to ensure that University operations meet the annual budget established by the Board of Trustees and all applicable regulatory requirements.

     Outreach
     To identify potential students, we engage in a broad range of activities to inform working adults and their employers about the programs offered at Strayer University. These activities include direct, digital, and social media marketing, marketing to our existing students and graduates, print and broadcast advertising, student referrals, and corporate and government outreach activities. Direct response methods (direct, digital, and social media marketing) are used to generate inquiries from potential students. All information relevant to prospective students is published on our website, www.strayer.edu. Strayer University maintains booths and information tables at appropriate conferences and expos, as well as at transfer days at community colleges. We also depend on the recommendation of our alumni network to maintain and enhance Strayer University’s reputation and promote its quality education. Our business-to-business outreach efforts include personal telephone calls, distribution of information through corporate intranets and human resource departments, and on-site information meetings. We record inquiries in our database and track them through to

application and registration. Additionally, we provide information about new programs to students and alumni to encourage them to return for further education.
     Student Profile
     The majority of Strayer University students are working adults completing their first college degree to improve their job skills and advance their careers. Of the students enrolled in Strayer University’s programs at the beginning of the 2017 fall quarter, approximately 64% were age 31 or older, and approximately 87% were engaged in part-time study (fewer than three courses each quarter for undergraduate students and fewer than two for graduate students).
     In the 2017 fall quarter, our undergraduate students registered for an average of approximately two courses and our graduate students for an average of approximately one course.
     Strayer University has a very diverse student population. At the beginning of the 2017 fall quarter, approximately 76% of students self-reporting their ethnicity were minorities, and approximately 66% of students were women. Approximately 1% of the University’s students were international, and approximately 1% were active duty military personnel. Strayer University prides itself on making post-secondary education accessible to working adults who were previously unable to take advantage of educational opportunities.
     The following is a breakdown of Strayer University students by program level as of the 2017 fall term:
    
 | Number of | Percentage of 
Program | students | total students
Bachelor’s | 34,692 | 72% 
Master’s | 11,780 | 24% 
Associate | 1,533 | 3% 
Total Degree | 48,005 | 99% 
Diploma | 6 | * 
Undeclared | 133 | * 
Total Non-Degree | 139 | 1% 
Total Students | 48,144 | 100% 


 *Represents less than 1%.
     Our business is seasonal and as a result, our quarterly results of operations tend to vary within the year due to student enrollment patterns. Enrollment generally is lowest in the third quarter, or summer term.
     Student Admissions
     Students attending Strayer University’s undergraduate programs must possess a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) Certificate. Students attending Strayer University’s graduate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution and meet certain other requirements. If a student’s undergraduate major varies widely from the student’s proposed graduate course of study, certain undergraduate prerequisite courses may also be necessary for admission. To maximize undergraduate students’ chances for academic success and to ensure they receive the support they need, Strayer University evaluates incoming students’ proficiency in fundamental English and math prior to the first quarter’s registration.
     International students applying for admission must meet the same admission requirements as other students. Those students whose native language is not English must provide evidence that they are able to use the English language with sufficient facility to perform college-level work in an English-speaking institution.

As of January 1, 2017, graduate students who were new to the University after January 1, 2015, are charged at a rate of $2,450 per course, while other graduate students are charged at a rate of $2,325 per course. For the Jack Welch Management Institute, students who are new to the University are charged at the rate of $3,650 per course. For some students who were previously enrolled in the Jack Welch Management Institute, tuition is charged at rates ranging from $2,580 to $3,450 per course. Under a variety of different programs and in connection with various corporate and government sponsorship and tuition reimbursement arrangements, Strayer University offers scholarships and tuition discounts to students. One of these programs, the Graduation Fund, offers a student in a bachelor’s program an opportunity to earn up to a 25% reduction of the tuition required for a degree. A new undergraduate student, with no transfer credit, seeking to obtain a bachelor’s degree in four years and who was eligible for our Graduation Fund would currently pay on average approximately $11,000 per year in tuition.     Career Development Services
     Although most of Strayer University’s students are already employed, the University actively assists its students and alumni with career-related matters. The focus for Career Services at Strayer University is to provide career guidance and resources to assist students and alumni in reaching their educational and professional goals. Services are delivered through various media including online, in person, recorded video, books, periodicals, and by telephone. The services provided include career webinars, recorded seminars, career teleconferences, career advising, and resume review.
     We regularly conduct alumni surveys to monitor the career progression of our graduates and to support outcome assessment efforts required by Middle States and state regulators.
     New York Code and Design Academy
     We acquired NYCDA in January 2016. NYCDA is a New York City-based provider of non-degree web and application software development courses. Courses are delivered on-ground to students seeking to further their career in software application development, with classes in several major markets across the United States, as well as in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. NYCDA does not participate in Title IV programs. Since its acquisition, NYCDA’s financial results have been insignificant relative to our consolidated financial results.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 1,389 full-time employees, including 281 full-time faculty members and 1,108 non-faculty staff. Full-time faculty members teach on average 4-5 courses per quarter. The balance of classes are taught by adjunct faculty who normally teach 1-2 courses per academic quarter. Although we had approximately 1,300 adjunct faculty throughout the year, not all of them teach every quarter. In the 2017 fall quarter, approximately 35% of our courses were taught by full-time faculty. Because we are not a research university, all faculty members are expected to spend their time teaching and advising students. In addition to our faculty, our non-faculty staff, including 155 part-time employees, serve in the areas of information systems, financial aid, recruitment and admissions, student administration, marketing, human resources, corporate accounting, and other administrative functions.     Intellectual Property
     In the ordinary course of business, we develop many kinds of intellectual property that are or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, or other protections. Such intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, our courseware materials for classes taught online or other distance-learning means and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of our operations and various education regulatory agencies. We also claim rights to certain marks, and have obtained federal registration of the marks, including the mark “STRAYER” for educational services.

     Competition
     The higher education industry is highly competitive, but fragmented, with no single participant possessing a significant market share. We compete for students with traditional public and private two-year and four-year degree-granting accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting accredited schools, and alternatives to higher education. In addition, we face competition from various non-traditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs, provided by both proprietary and not-for-profit providers, including massive open online courses offered worldwide without charge by traditional educational institutions and other direct-to-consumer education services. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence. As online learning matures as a modality for education delivery across higher education, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase.
     We believe the key factors affecting our competitive position include the quality of the programs offered, the quality of other services provided to students, our reputation among students and in the general marketplace, the cost and perceived value of our offerings, the employment rate and terms of employment for our graduates, the ease of access to our offerings, the quality and reputation of our faculty and other employees, the quality of our campus facilities and online platform, the time commitment required to complete our program and obtain a degree, the quality and size of our alumni base, and our relationship with other learning institutions.
     Regulation
     Regulatory Environment
     As an institution of higher education accredited by Middle States and operating in multiple jurisdictions, Strayer University is subject to accreditation rules and varying state licensing and regulatory requirements. In addition, the federal Higher Education Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require all higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs, including Strayer University, to comply with detailed substantive and reporting requirements, and to undergo periodic regulatory scrutiny. The Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibility for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education (“Secretary of Education”); (2) state education regulatory bodies; and (3) the federal government through the Department of Education. The regulations, standards, and policies of these regulatory agencies are subject to frequent change. NYCDA is subject to certain state regulatory requirements but is not accredited and does not participate in Title IV programs.
     The November 2016 federal elections brought a new President and Congress, and we cannot predict the actions that the new Administration or Congress may take or their effect on Strayer University, NYCDA, or the Company. Among other things, the new Congress may reauthorize the Higher Education Act and repeal or amend other legislation affecting higher education institutions. The new Congress or Administration may also delay, block, modify, or eliminate certain Title IV and other regulations applicable to higher education institutions, or the new Administration may promulgate new regulations upon culmination of current negotiated rulemaking processes, or otherwise. In addition, the new Administration may interpret, apply, and enforce Title IV and other regulations in a manner different from current guidance and practice.
     Department of Education
     To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. An institution must, among other things, be authorized to offer its educational programs by each state in which it is physically located and maintain institutional accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency, as discussed below. The institution also must be certified by the Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs and follow Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under Title IV programs. For purposes of Title IV programs, Strayer University and all of its campuses are considered to be a single institution of 

 
  15

 
higher education, such that Department of Education requirements applicable to an institution of higher education are generally applied to all of Strayer University’s campuses in the aggregate rather than on an individual basis. On October 11, 2017, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University’s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through June 30, 2021.
     Accreditation
     Accreditation is a system for recognizing educational institutions for integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability, and financial stability that signifies that they merit the confidence of the educational community and the public. In the United States, this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations of institutions and programs of higher education. These associations establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs, and publicly designate those institutions that meet their standards. Accredited institutions or programs are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to determine whether such institutions or programs continue to maintain the performance, integrity, and quality required for accreditation. If an institution’s or program’s performance does not meet its accrediting agency’s (or other regulator’s) expectations or applicable standards, then its operations may be conditioned, severely constrained, or even curtailed, depending on the severity of the noncompliance.
     Strayer University has been institutionally accredited since 1981 by Middle States, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Strayer University went through a period of reaffirmation of accreditation that began in 2015 and lasted through June 2017, when Middle States reaffirmed Strayer University’s accreditation. The University’s period of accreditation by Middle States extends into 2025. Middle States accredits degree-granting public and private colleges and universities in its region (including Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), including distance education programs offered by those institutions. Accreditation by Middle States is an important attribute of Strayer University. Colleges and universities depend on accreditation to evaluate transferability of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accreditation status of institutions when evaluating a candidate’s credentials or considering tuition reimbursement programs. Students rely on accreditation status for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.
     In order for institutions to be eligible to participate in federal student financial assistance programs, they must be accredited by an institutional accreditor recognized by the Secretary of Education. The Higher Education Act charges the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (“NACIQI”) with recommending to the Secretary of Education which accrediting or state approval agencies should be recognized as reliable authorities for judging the quality of post-secondary institutions and programs. In June 2017, NACIQI renewed its recognition of Middle States for six months and required Middle States to demonstrate compliance with certain requirements. NACIQI reviewed Middle States at its February 2018 meeting and extended its recognition for five years. If an institutional accreditor loses recognition by the Secretary of Education, an institution may be allowed to continue its participation in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period not to exceed 18 months to allow the institution to seek accreditation from another recognized accrediting agency. An institution that does not become accredited by another recognized accreditor within 18 months will lose Title IV eligibility.
     Beginning in 2013, Middle States undertook a review of its accreditation standards and, in June 2014, approved revised accreditation standards, with subsequent editorial clarifications. The new standards are effective for all institutions that have self-studies due beginning with the 2017-2018 academic year. 
     In 2016, Middle States provided that reaccreditation for all of its institutions will be for a period of eight years (rather than ten, as previously was the case) and that institutions will be required to submit annual reports on student achievement and financial sustainability. In accordance with Middle States’ accreditation standards, every accredited institution will undergo a periodic review at the mid-point between its eight-year evaluations. 
     All of Strayer University’s substantive changes require prior Middle States approval. Such changes include, but are not limited to, certain new educational programs, certain contractual arrangements with other institutions providing a portion of an educational program, establishment or closure of additional locations and branch campuses, and changes in ownership or control.

     In 2000, the agencies that accredit higher education institutions in various regions of the United States adopted a Policy Statement on Evaluation of Institutions Operating Interregionally. Under that policy, both the home regional accreditor and the host regional accreditor cooperate to evaluate an institution that delivers education at a physical site in the host accreditor’s region. Although the home region is solely responsible for final accreditation actions, as Strayer University opens campuses in regions outside Middle States’ region, the host regional accreditors may elect to participate in the accreditation process of such expansion operations.
     In addition to institutional accreditation, the University has obtained specialized or programmatic accreditation, or professional recognition, from the following organizations for specific programs: the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (“ACBSP”), the Society for Human Resource Management (“SHRM”), the National Security Agency’s Committee on National Security Systems, and the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (“TEAC”) which was recently consolidated with the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education to form the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (“CAEP”). The baccalaureate degree program in nursing at Strayer University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 655 K Street, Suite 750, Washington, D.C. 20001, (202) 887-6791.
     State Education Licensure
     Licensure of Physical Campuses
     The Higher Education Act and certain state laws require Strayer University to be legally authorized to provide educational programs in the states in which the University is physically located or demonstrates physical presence as defined by the state. We are authorized to offer programs by the applicable educational regulatory agencies in all states where our physical campuses and online delivery facilities are located. We are dependent upon the authorization of each state where we are physically located to allow us to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates to students in those states. We are subject to extensive regulation in each jurisdiction in which our campuses are located, including in 2017: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. We will be subject to similar extensive regulation in those additional states in which we may expand our operations in the future. State laws and regulations affect our operations and may limit our ability to introduce educational programs or establish new campuses. 
     On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education adopted new regulations, effective July 1, 2011, that set new requirements on states for their authorization of schools for purposes of Title IV eligibility. We believe that every state above in which Strayer is authorized has processes in place that comply with these requirements.
     Licensure of Online Programs
     The increasing popularity and use of the internet and other technology for the delivery of education has led, and may continue to lead, to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries or to the interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to such services. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as the requirement that online education institutions be licensed as a school in one or more jurisdictions even where they have no physical location. New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase Strayer University’s cost of doing business, affect its ability to increase enrollments and revenues, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.
     In April 2013, the Department of Education announced that it would address state authorization of distance education through negotiated rulemaking. While four negotiated rulemaking sessions were conducted from February through May 2014, no consensus was reached.
     In June 2016, despite the lack of consensus at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, but as permitted by federal law, the Department of Education issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for public comment on the issue of state authorization for online programs. On December 19, 2016, the Department issued final regulations, which are scheduled 

 
  17

 
to become effective on July 1, 2018. On January 30, 2017, the new Administration indicated in a notice published in the Federal Register that it intends to take action in relation to this regulation, but it is unclear what that action will be or when it will be taken. The regulations currently expected to be effective on July 1, 2018, will, among other things, require an institution offering Title IV-eligible distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. Institutions can obtain such authorization directly from the state or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement. A state authorization reciprocity agreement is defined as an agreement between two or more states that authorizes an institution located and legally authorized in a state covered by the agreement to provide post-secondary education through distance education or correspondence courses to students in other states covered by the agreement and does not prohibit a participating state from enforcing its own laws with respect to higher education. The regulations also require institutions to document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses for each state in which such students reside.
     In addition, the regulations require an institution to provide public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education or correspondence courses. The public disclosures would include state authorization for the program or course, the process for submitting complaints to relevant states, any adverse actions by a state or accrediting agency related to the distance education program or correspondence course within the past five years, refund policies specific to the state, and applicable licensure or certification requirements for a career that the program prepares a student to enter. An institution must disclose directly to all prospective students if a distance education or correspondence course does not meet the licensure or certification requirements for a state. An institution must disclose to each current and prospective student when an adverse action is taken against a distance education or correspondence program and any determination that a program ceases to meet licensure or certification requirements.
     If an institution’s distance education program is found not to be in compliance, the institution may lose its ability to award Title IV funds for that distance education program.
     State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement 
     Varying state regulations, fees, and paperwork embedded in the many different state approaches to regulation of post-secondary institutions have limited the ability to grow across state lines to offer students high quality choices for education and have hindered national workforce initiatives. As a solution to the ever-growing complexity of the regulatory oversight of institutions of higher learning on a state-by-state basis, the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”) has emerged to aid in the advancement of distance education. 
     SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by post-secondary institutions based in another state, while also facilitating more effective and efficient oversight and monitoring processes nationally for the benefit of states and institutions. On December 2, 2016, Strayer University became a participant in SARA. As a participant in SARA, Strayer University may offer online courses and other forms of distance education to students in any participating SARA state in which Strayer does not have a physical location or a physical presence as defined by the state without having to seek any new state institutional approval beyond its home state (Washington, D.C.). Strayer University’s home state, in turn, will continually monitor the institution’s compliance with SARA standards. With this initiative, Strayer University will be able to expand its distance education offerings with increased consistency and ease.
     The reciprocity agreement does not affect Strayer University operations that constitute a physical presence in a particular state, and the University will continue to follow individual state regulations for its on-ground campuses and activities. To the extent that such approval is required by state law, the University also must obtain approval from each state that is not a SARA member (i.e., California and Massachusetts) if the University seeks to enroll students from those states in the University’s distance education programs. At this time, SARA does not deal with professional licensing board approval for programs leading to state licensing in fields such as nursing, teacher education, psychology, and the like, and Strayer University must seek such approvals on a state-by-state basis, as needed.

     Other Approvals
     Strayer University is approved by appropriate authorities for the education of active duty military personnel and qualifying family members, veterans and members of the selected reserve and their spouses and dependents, as well as for the rehabilitation of veterans. In addition, Strayer University is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. The University is also authorized to participate in state financial aid programs in Pennsylvania, Florida, and Vermont.     Financing Student Education
     Students finance their Strayer University education in a variety of ways, and historically about three quarters of students participated in one or more Title IV programs. Many financial aid programs are designed to assist eligible students whose financial resources are inadequate to meet the cost of education. With these programs, financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the cost of attending a program of study and the amount a student reasonably can be expected to contribute to those expenses. All recipients of federal student financial aid must maintain a satisfactory grade point average (“GPA”) and progress in a timely manner toward completion of a program of study. 
     In addition, many of our working adult students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Congress has enacted several tax credits for students pursuing higher education and has provided for a tax deduction for interest on student loans and exclusions from income of certain tuition reimbursement amounts. Eligible students at Strayer University may also participate in educational assistance programs administered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of Florida, the State of Vermont, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) (and related state agencies), the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), and various private organizations.
     Under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2009 (as amended August 1, 2011), sometimes referred to as the “New GI Bill,” eligible veterans may receive, among other benefits, tuition benefits up to the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance), subject to a cap of $22,085 for non-public domestic institutions for 2017-2018. In addition, eligible students pursuing an educational program solely through distance learning are eligible to receive a housing stipend equal to half the amount available to students attending certain classroom-based programs or programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning.
     On August 16, 2017, the President signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, commonly known as the Forever GI Bill. The law makes several changes to the administration of VA education benefits. Among other things, for service members who left the military after January 1, 2013, the bill removes the requirement that they use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits within 15 years after their last 90-day period of active-duty service. The bill also alters the way the VA calculates eligibility for VA education benefits by providing additional benefits to service members with at least 90 days but less than six months of active-duty service. Additionally, the bill will restore VA education benefits to students who were enrolled in schools that closed after January 2015 if their credits did not transfer.
     Strayer University participates in DOD military tuition assistance programs under a Memorandum of Understanding executed on September 5, 2014. Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the DOD military tuition assistance programs. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the University agrees to comply with DOD rules and procedures regarding the receipt of tuition assistance on behalf of active duty military personnel (and qualifying family members) in attendance at the University.

 Title IV Programs
     Strayer University maintains eligibility for its students to participate in the following Title IV programs:
    
· | Federal Grants. Grants under the Federal Pell Grant program are available to eligible students based on financial need and other factors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Campus-Based Programs. The campus-based Title IV programs include the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, the Federal Perkins Loan, and the Federal Work-Study Program. Strayer University does not actively participate in the Perkins Loan or the Federal Work-Study Program. The Perkins Loan Program expired on September 30, 2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Federal Direct Student Loans. Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Department of Education makes loans directly to students and their parents. Undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized loan. The federal government pays the interest on a subsidized loan while the student is in school and during any approved periods of deferment, after which the student’s obligation to repay the loan begins. Unsubsidized loans are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized loan or, in some cases, in addition to a subsidized loan. PLUS loans, including Graduate PLUS loans, are unsubsidized loans available in amounts up to the total cost of attendance less any other financial aid.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Federal Financial Aid Regulation
     To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. As part of those participation standards, the Department of Education determines whether, among other things, the institution meets certain standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility. The institution must also follow extensive Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under Title IV programs. Some of the key provisions regarding institutional eligibility and processing federal financial aid are described below.     Program Participation Agreement
     Each institution participating in Title IV programs must enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department. Under the agreement, the institution agrees to follow the Department’s rules and regulations governing Title IV programs. On October 11, 2017, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University’s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through June 30, 2021.     Provisional Certification
     In certain circumstances, the Department of Education may certify an institution’s continuing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for up to three complete award years (July 1 – June 30) from the date of provisional certification. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If the Department of Education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may revoke or further condition the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Should the Department of Education revoke eligibility during the provisional period, the institution may request reconsideration and the Secretary of Education’s decision whether or not revocation is warranted constitutes final agency action. Strayer University is operating under full certification.

 Administrative Capability
     Department of Education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution, among other things, must: (1) comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; (2) have cohort default rates below specified levels; (3) have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; (4) not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; (5) submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and (6) not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.     Financial Responsibility
     The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Strayer University must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to the Department of Education for debts and liabilities incurred in programs administered by the Department of Education.
     Department of Education standards utilize a complex formula to assess financial responsibility. The standards focus on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s financial viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit or within its means). An institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without alternative measures and further federal oversight. We have applied the financial responsibility standards to our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, and based on our calculated composite score and other relevant factors, we believe we meet the Department of Education’s financial responsibility standards.
     On November 1, 2016, the Department of Education released a new regulation, which was scheduled to take effect July 1, 2017, which would make significant changes to the financial responsibility criteria. Under the final regulation, an institution may no longer be considered financially responsible if one or more of a list of “triggering events” occurs. The Department of Education would automatically determine that an institution is not financially responsible if, among other things, the institution receives certain warnings from the SEC, fails to timely file required reports, or has a cohort default rate of 30% or greater for each of the two most recent official calculations. The Department of Education would also determine that an institution is not financially responsible if certain triggering events, such as a lawsuit against the institution, an accrediting agency’s requirement that the institution submit a teach-out plan, or potential loss of Title IV eligibility for gainful employment programs, result in the institution’s recalculated composite score to be less than 1.0. Under the released regulation, the Department of Education could also invoke certain “discretionary” triggering events, such as citation by a state agency or accrediting agency for failure to satisfy the agency’s standards, to determine that an institution is not financially responsible. The Department has delayed until July 1, 2019, the implementation of this regulation, pending the outcome of an ongoing negotiated rulemaking process related to the underlying subject matter. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately will be adopted.
     Student Loan Defaults
     Under the Higher Education Act, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of Direct Loan or Federal Family Education Loan (“FFEL”) Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. The Department of Education uses a specific methodology to determine default rates and imposes varying sanctions based upon the results of that calculation. As discussed below, the cohort default rate calculation and threshold for regulatory sanctions changed effective 2014 as a result of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act through the Higher Education Opportunity Act (“HEOA”), which was effective August 18, 2008.
    
 
  21

 

 The Department of Education calculates a rate of student defaults (known as a cohort default rate) for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year. The Department of Education includes in the cohort all student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct or FFEL Program loan during that year. The cohort default rate is the percentage of those borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year and default by the end of the second federal fiscal year following that fiscal year, resulting in a three-year cohort default rate. Because of the need to collect data on defaults, the Department of Education publishes cohort default rates three years in arrears; for example, in the fall of 2017, the Department of Education issued cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2014.
     The Department of Education may take adverse action against an institution if it has excessive cohort default rates, including the following:
    
· | If an institution’s cohort default rate is 30% or more in a given fiscal year, the institution will be required to assemble a “default prevention task force” and submit to the Department of Education a default improvement plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If an institution’s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two consecutive years, the institution will be required to review, revise, and resubmit its default improvement plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If an institution’s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two out of three consecutive years, the Department of Education may subject the institution to provisional certification.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which data are available, the institution will be ineligible to participate in the Direct Loan Program and Federal Pell Grant Program.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      An institution generally loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its most recent cohort default rate is greater than 40%, and institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 15% for any of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available are subject to a 30-day delayed disbursement period for first-year, first-time undergraduate borrowers. Although Strayer has not had a cohort default rate at or above 15% in any of the three most recent fiscal years, Strayer voluntarily disburses Direct Loans in this manner.
     Strayer’s official three-year cohort default rates for 2012, 2013, and 2014, as well as the average official three-year cohort default rates for proprietary institutions nationally, were as follows:
    
 | | National Average 
 | Strayer University | Proprietary Institutions
2014 | 13.2% | 15.5% 
2013 | 11.3% | 15.0% 
2012 | 11.6% | 15.8% 

      As part of its compliance program related to the cohort default rate, Strayer University provides entrance and exit counseling to its students and engages the services of a third party to counsel students once they are in repayment status regarding their repayment obligations.
     The 90/10 Rule
     A requirement of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education, which includes Strayer University. Under this rule, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenues (as revenues are computed under the Department of Education’s methodology) from Title IV funds on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year.
     A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for up to two fiscal years. Proprietary institutions of higher education that violate the 90/10 Rule 

 
  22

 
for two consecutive fiscal years will become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and will be required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. In addition, the Department of Education discloses on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the 90/10 requirement, and reports annually to Congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education.
     Using the statutory formula, Strayer University derived approximately 75% of its cash-basis revenues from Title IV program funds in 2016. Our computation for 2017 has not yet been finalized and audited; however, we believe we will remain in compliance with the 90/10 Rule requirement.
     The key components of non-Title IV revenue for Strayer University are individual student payments, employer tuition reimbursement payments, veterans’ benefits, vocational rehabilitation funds, private loans, state grants, and scholarships. In the past, certain members of Congress have proposed to revise the 90/10 Rule to count DOD tuition assistance and veterans’ education benefits along with Title IV revenue toward the 90% limit and to reduce the limit to 85% of total revenue. In the context of Higher Education Act reauthorization, other members of Congress recently have proposed legislation that would eliminate the 90/10 Rule. We cannot predict whether or how the recent change in Administration and Congress will affect the 90/10 Rule.
     Incentive Compensation
     As a part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the Department of Education and in accordance with the Higher Education Act and Title IV regulations, the institution may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid-awarding activity. The rule applies to all employees at an institution who are engaged in or responsible for any student recruitment or admission activity or making decisions regarding the award of financial aid. The Department of Education has interpreted the regulation not to apply to certain high-level employees, including senior managers and executive level employees who are involved only in the development of policy and do not engage in individual student contact. Merit-based adjustments to employee compensation may be made if they are not based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid. 
     Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in loss of certification to participate in federal student financial aid programs, limitations on participation in the federal student financial aid programs, or financial penalties. In June 2015, the Department of Education announced in a memorandum that it will revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the incentive payment prohibition. The Department of Education will calculate the amount of institutional liability based on the cost to the Department of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to the Department of all Title IV funds received by the institution over a period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment prohibition. We believe we are in compliance with the regulation.
     Gainful Employment
     Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts (for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations related to gainful employment. The regulation went into effect on July 1, 2015, with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which generally went into effect January 1, 2017, although some portions of those requirements have now been delayed until July 1, 2018. In addition, the Department has convened a new negotiated rulemaking related to gainful employment, and 

 
  23

 
has held negotiated rulemaking sessions. We cannot predict what new regulations will be proposed or ultimately will be adopted.
     The current regulations include two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual income rate measures student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measures student debt in relation to discretionary income. A program passes if the program’s graduates:
    
· | have an annual income rate ratio that does not exceed 8%; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | have a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, a program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics, and that has an annual income rate between 8% and 12% or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30%, is considered to be in a warning zone. A program fails if the program’s graduates have an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program would become Title IV-ineligible for three years if it fails both metrics for two out of three consecutive years, or fails to pass at least one metric for four consecutive award years. The regulations provide a means by which an institution may challenge the Department of Education’s calculation of any of the debt metrics prior to loss of Title IV eligibility.
     If an institution is notified by the Secretary of Education that a program could become ineligible, based on its final rates, for the next award year:
    
· | the institution must provide a warning with respect to the program to students and prospective students indicating, among other things, that students may not be able to use Title IV funds to attend or continue in the program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the institution must not enroll, register, or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until a specified time after providing the warning to the prospective student.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      On January 8, 2017, Strayer received its final 2015 debt-to-earnings measures. None of Strayer’s programs failed the debt-to-earnings metrics. Two active programs, the Associate in Arts in Accounting and Associate in Arts in Business Administration, are “in the zone,” which means each program remains fully eligible unless (1) either program has a combination of zone and failing designations for four consecutive years, in which case it would become Title IV-ineligible in the fifth year; or (2) either program fails the metrics for two out of three consecutive years, in which case the program could become ineligible for the following award year. The Department has not yet released 2016 debt-to-earnings measures, and it is unclear when the Department intends to do so.
     The current regulation also requires institutions annually to report student- and program-level data to the Department of Education, and comply with additional disclosure requirements. Final regulations adopted by the Department of Education, which generally became effective on July 1, 2011, require an institution to use a template designed by the Department of Education to disclose to prospective students, with respect to each gainful employment program, occupations that the program prepares students to enter, total cost of the program, on-time graduation rate, job placement rate, if applicable, and the median loan debt of program completers for the most recently completed award year. The regulation that became effective July 1, 2015 expands upon those existing disclosure requirements and institutions were required to comply with the new template by July 1, 2017. Strayer University timely complied by posting information in the new template. On January 19, 2018, the Department of Education released the most recent version of the disclosure template, which institutions must adopt on or before April 6, 2018. Unlike the previous version, the new template does not require institutions to disclose median earnings data or room and board charges. On June 30, 2017, the Department of Education announced that it will allow institutions until July 1, 2018 to comply with certain disclosure requirements in the final regulations, including requirements to include a link to the disclosure template in promotional materials and to distribute directly a copy of the disclosure template to prospective students.
     In addition, the gainful employment regulation requires institutions to certify, among other things, that each eligible gainful employment program is programmatically accredited if required by a federal governmental entity or a state 

 
  24

 
governmental entity of a state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval. Institutions also must certify that each eligible program satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in each state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, so that a student who completes the program and seeks employment in that state qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter. The University has timely made the required certification.
     Under the gainful employment regulation, an institution may establish a new program’s Title IV eligibility by updating the list of the institution’s programs maintained by the Department of Education. However, an institution may not update its list of eligible programs to include a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible, or a gainful employment program that is substantially similar to such a program, until three years after the loss of eligibility or discontinuance.
     The requirements associated with the gainful employment regulations may substantially increase our administrative burdens and could affect our program offerings, student enrollment, persistence, and retention. Further, although the regulations provide opportunities for an institution to correct any potential deficiencies in a program prior to the loss of Title IV eligibility, the continuing eligibility of our academic programs may be affected by factors beyond management’s control, such as changes in our graduates’ employment and income levels, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, and various other factors. Even if we were able to correct any deficiency in the gainful employment metrics in a timely manner, the disclosure requirements associated with a program’s failure to meet at least one metric may adversely affect student enrollments in that program and may adversely affect the reputation of our institution.
     Return of Federal Funds
     Under the Higher Education Act’s return-of-funds provision, an institution must return Title IV funds to a Title IV program in a timely manner if a student received funds from that program but did not earn them due to the student’s withdrawal from the institution. In order to determine if funds should be returned, the institution must first determine the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned. If the student attends the institution, but withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. Strayer University is required to measure the last day of attendance based on official attendance records, and “attendance” for online classes must include participation in an academically-related activity. Strayer University’s systems allow for measurement on this basis. If the student withdraws after the 60% point, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of the unearned Title IV program funds or the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date that the institution determines that a student withdrew.
     If the funds are not returned in a timely manner, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under Department of Education regulations, if late returns of Title IV program funds constitute 5% or more of students sampled in the institution’s annual compliance audit for either of its two most recently completed fiscal years, an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the Secretary of Education.
     Misrepresentation 
     Under the Higher Education Act, the Department of Education may fine, suspend, or terminate an institution’s participation in Title IV programs if it engages in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Program Integrity Regulations, which took effect July 1, 2011, set forth the types of activities that constitute misrepresentation and describe the adverse actions that the Department of Education may take if it finds that an institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution engaged in substantial misrepresentation. The rule specifies the types of statements that can subject the institution to liability for misrepresentation, as well as the 

 
  25

 
nature and form of misleading statements. The rule provides that an institution may not describe the eligible institution’s participation in Title IV programs in a manner that suggests Department of Education approval or endorsement of the quality of its educational programs by the Department of Education. 
     On June 5, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Department of Education’s expansion of the definition of misrepresentation to include “any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse” was unsupported by law, and thus vacated that portion of the regulation. In response to the court’s ruling, on September 20, 2013, the Department of Education published technical amendments to the regulation. As part of the Department’s 2016 promulgation of the Borrower Defenses to Repayment regulation, the Department changed the definition of misrepresentation for Title IV regulations to include any statement that “has the likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances.” The newly expanded definition also includes “any statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading.” This regulation was published on November 1, 2016 and was scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017. However, the Department has delayed implementation until July 1, 2019 pending the outcome of ongoing negotiated rulemaking process, which may revisit the definition of misrepresentation. We cannot predict what definition of misrepresentation ultimately will be proposed or adopted.
     Borrower Defenses
     Pursuant to the Higher Education Act and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, the Department of Education released a final regulation specifying the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the Secretary of Education. Under the regulation, for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, a student borrower may assert a defense to repayment if: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a “substantial misrepresentation” on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment. These defenses are asserted through claims submitted to the Department of Education, and the Department has the authority to issue a final decision. In addition, the regulation permits the Department to grant relief to an individual or group of individuals, including individuals who have not applied to the Department seeking relief. If a defense is successfully raised, the Department has discretion to initiate action to collect from an institution the amount of losses incurred based on the borrower defense. The new regulation also amends the rules concerning discharge of federal student loans when a school or campus closes and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers for borrower defense-type claims. On January 19, 2017, the Department of Education issued a final rule with request for comments, updating the hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution of higher education and establishing procedures for recovery proceedings under the borrower defense regulations. On June 16, 2017, the Department of Education announced that in light of the existence and potential consequences of pending litigation that had been brought in federal court to challenge the regulations, it had decided to postpone indefinitely the implementation of certain provisions of the regulations. Also on June 16, 2017, the Department of Education announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations and to address certain other related matters. On October 24, 2017, the Department of Education delayed until July 1, 2018 the effective date of the provisions of the regulations identified in the June 16, 2017 notice, and thereafter implemented a further delay until July 1, 2019 pending the outcome of an ongoing negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiated rulemaking committee held meetings in November 2017, January 2018, and February 2018. We cannot predict what new regulations will be proposed or ultimately will be adopted.
     Third-Party Servicers
     Department of Education regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution’s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to the Department of Education new contracts or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. Strayer University has written contracts with third-party servicers to perform activities related to Strayer University’s participation in Title IV programs. Strayer University also has a 

 
  26

 
contract with Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. for processing stipends due to students. For loan default prevention, Strayer University contracts with i3 Group, LLC. Strayer believes that its third-party servicer contracts comply with the regulations and we have reported such contracts to the Department of Education.
     Lender Relationships
     As part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the Department of Education, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans. Strayer University has a code of conduct that it believes complies with the provisions of the Higher Education Act in all material respects. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, the Higher Education Act contains provisions that apply to lenders, prohibiting lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions.     Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
     State requirements and accrediting agency standards can limit or slow the ability of Strayer University to establish legally authorized additional locations and programs. Most states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. Middle States requires its accredited institutions to notify it in advance of implementing new programs or locations, which may require additional approval. At its discretion, Middle States may also conduct site visits to additional locations to ensure that accredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of additional locations, among other reasons, maintain educational quality. All new Strayer University campus locations require Middle States approval before students are enrolled, and the Higher Education Act requires Middle States to monitor institutions with significant enrollment growth. Under Strayer University’s full certification, the Department of Education must be notified within ten days of a new campus location, level of academic offering, and non-degree and degree programs, but prior approval is not required.
     The Higher Education Act requires proprietary institutions of higher education to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, the applicable regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. These additional locations generally may qualify immediately for participation in Title IV programs, unless the location was acquired from another institution that has ceased offering educational programs at that location and has Title IV liabilities that it is not repaying in accordance with an agreement to do so, and the acquiring institution does not agree, among other matters, to be responsible for certain liabilities of the acquired institution. The new location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval of the additional location by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency. Any Strayer University expansion plans assume its continued ability to establish new campuses as additional locations of Strayer University under such applicable regulations and thereby avoid incurring the two-year delay in participation in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization or accreditation of Strayer University or an existing campus, or the failure of Strayer University or a new campus to obtain state authorization or accreditation, would render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, at least in that state or at that location. Department of Education regulations require institutions to report to the Department of Education a new additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered, if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Under its Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education, Strayer University must notify the Department of Education of the addition of any such location within ten days of opening, but need not seek prior approval. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions.
     The gainful employment regulation that became effective July 1, 2015 provides that an institution may establish a new program’s Title IV eligibility by updating the list of the institution’s programs maintained by the Department of Education, and thereby making the certification required by the regulation, as described under Gainful Employment. However, an institution may not update its list of eligible programs to include a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible, or a gainful employment program that is substantially similar to such a program, until three years after the loss of eligibility or discontinuance.

 Credit Hours
     The Higher Education Act and regulations use the term “credit hour” to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV program funds an institution may disburse during a payment period. The regulations define the term “credit hour” and require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution’s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by the Department of Education could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution’s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If the Department of Education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the Department of Education could impose liabilities or other sanctions.     Other Regulations Governing Title IV Programs
     The Department of Education has enacted a comprehensive set of regulations governing an institution’s participation in Title IV programs. If Strayer University were not to continue to comply with these regulations, such noncompliance might affect the operations of the University and its ability to participate in Title IV programs.     The Clery Act
     Strayer University must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the “Clery Act”). In addition, the Department has interpreted Title IX to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination and to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure by Strayer University to comply with the Clery Act or Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department fining Strayer University, or limiting or suspending its participating in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, and could harm Strayer University’s reputation. We believe that Strayer University is in compliance with these requirements.     Compliance Reviews
     Strayer University is subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department of Education, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, guaranty agencies, and accrediting agencies. The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations also require an institution to submit annually to the Secretary of Education a compliance audit of its administration of Title IV programs conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit guides of the Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General (“ED OIG”). For fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, Strayer University must submit such audits that have been conducted in accordance with a revised guide for audits of proprietary schools that was issued by the ED OIG in September 2016. In addition, to enable the Secretary of Education to make a determination of financial responsibility, an institution must submit annually to the Secretary of Education audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Department of Education regulations.
     In 2014, the Department of Education conducted four campus-based program reviews of Strayer University locations in three states and the District of Columbia. The reviews covered federal financial aid years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, and two of the reviews also covered compliance with the Clery Act, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, and regulations related thereto. For three of the program reviews, we received correspondence from the Department closing the program reviews with no further action required by us. For the other program review, the University received a Final Program Review Determination Letter closing the review and identifying a payment of less than $500 due to the Department of Education based on an underpayment on a return to Title IV calculation. The University remitted payment, and received a letter from the Department indicating that no further action was required and that the matter was closed.

 Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
     If Strayer University fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the Department of Education could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring Strayer University from the advance payment method to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV funds, requiring the University to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against the University, or referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate Strayer University’s participation in Title IV programs. Although there are no such sanctions currently in force, if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against Strayer University and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of the University’s participation in Title IV programs or resulted in substantial fines or monetary liabilities, Strayer University would be materially and adversely affected.
     If Strayer University lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if Congress reduced the amount of available federal student financial aid, the University would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although the University believes that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending Strayer University, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such student financial aid are unlikely to be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. Strayer University might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance in a manner that complies with rules governing schools’ relationships with lenders or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of eligibility of Strayer University to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on Strayer University, even if it could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
     In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties.
     Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
     Many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies. Strayer University’s accrediting agency, Middle States, requires institutions that it accredits to inform it in advance of any substantive change, including a change that significantly alters the ownership or control of the institution. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to, and approval by Middle States include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a proprietary institution. Middle States must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution’s accreditation status. Middle States will undertake a site visit to an institution that has undergone a change in ownership or control no later than six months after the change.
     Federal agencies also regulate changes in ownership and control. The Higher Education Act provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to the Department of Education in order to reestablish such eligibility. An institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period from the change of ownership and control until recertification. The Higher Education Act provides that the Department of Education may temporarily, provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change of ownership and control based on preliminary review by the Department of Education of a materially complete application received by the Department of Education within ten business days after the transaction. The Department of Education may continue such temporary, provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application. If the Department of Education approves the application after a change in ownership and control, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. The Higher Education Act defines one of the events that would trigger a change in ownership resulting in a change of control as the transfer of the controlling interest of the stock of the institution or its parent corporation. For a 

 
  29

 
publicly traded corporation such as Strayer Education, Inc., the Department of Education regulations define a change of control as occurring when a person or entity acquires ownership and control of a corporation, such that the corporation is required to file a Form 8-K with the SEC publicly disclosing the change of control. The regulations also provide that a change in ownership and control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if a person or entity who is a controlling stockholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling stockholder. A controlling stockholder is a stockholder who holds, or controls through agreement, at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other stockholder.
     The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. Strayer University currently is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements. In certain circumstances, the Department of Homeland Security may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.
     Pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists, some of the programs offered by Strayer University are approved by state approving agencies for the enrollment of persons eligible to receive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits. In 2017, we had such approval in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.
     If Strayer University underwent a change of control that required approval by any state authority, Middle States, or any federal agency, and such approval were significantly delayed, limited, or denied, there could be a material adverse effect on Strayer University’s ability to offer certain educational programs, award certain degrees, diplomas, or certificates, operate one or more of its locations, admit certain students, or participate in Title IV programs, which in turn, could materially and adversely affect Strayer University’s operations. A change that required approval by a state regulatory authority, Middle States, or a federal agency could also delay Strayer University’s ability to establish new campuses or educational programs and may have other adverse regulatory effects. Furthermore, the suspension from Title IV programs and the necessity of obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with a change of control could materially limit Strayer University’s flexibility in future financing or acquisition transactions.
     Legislative and Regulatory Activity
     Congress, from time to time, considers legislation that would make changes in the Higher Education Act and other education-related federal laws. The Department of Education and other federal agencies similarly consider new regulations and regulatory amendments. State legislatures and agencies and accreditors likewise periodically change their laws, regulations, and standards. Such activity may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions. Although legislative and regulatory activity in recent years has had a negative impact on the for-profit post-secondary education industry as a whole, we cannot predict the impact of recent, pending, or possible future legislative or regulatory changes, if any, on our long-term business model.     Congress
     Congress historically has reauthorized the Higher Education Act (“HEA”), which is the law governing Title IV programs, approximately every five to six years. In 2008, Congress reauthorized the HEA through the end of 2013. Congress has held hearings regarding the reauthorization of the HEA and continued to consider new legislation regarding the passage thereof. Despite inaction on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, Congress extended funding for Title IV through September 30, 2018, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. In December 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce considered and passed out of committee the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act, or PROSPER Act, to reauthorize the HEA. In its current form, the PROSPER Act would make dramatic changes to the HEA by, among other things, eliminating the 90/10 Rule, eliminating regulation of gainful employment programs, and replacing current accountability metrics linked to cohort default rates with metrics linked to timely loan repayment. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions has begun to hold hearings on the HEA reauthorization, and the Chairman has

issued a white paper including a number of policy proposals for consideration. We cannot predict what the final reauthorization will or will not do, or when or how it will be enacted, or its effects on Strayer University.
     Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially proprietary institutions. For example, on February 13, 2017, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the legislation that would amend the HEA to modify required consumer information disclosures related to completion graduation rates by expanding such disclosure requirements to include information about additional categories of students. On March 20, 2017, Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY) introduced legislation that would amend loan counseling requirements under the HEA. On April 7, 2017, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) introduced legislation that would add mandatory disclosure requirements to an institution’s financial aid offer form and require use of a standardized form. We cannot predict whether these or similar bills, and others affecting our business, will be introduced or will pass or what, if any, impact they would have on our business.
     Appropriations
     Congress reviews and determines appropriations for Title IV programs on an annual basis. An elimination of certain Title IV programs, a reduction in federal funding levels of such programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education. This, in turn, could lead to lower enrollments at Strayer University or require us to increase our reliance upon alternative sources of student financial aid. Given the significant percentage of our revenues that are derived indirectly from Title IV programs, the loss of, or a significant reduction in Title IV program funds available to our students could have a material adverse effect on Strayer University.
     Beginning July 1, 2017, in accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, institutions that participate in the Title IV programs may award Pell Grant funds for up to 150% of a student’s standard scheduled Pell Grant in one award year. This provision, which commonly is referred to as “year-round Pell,” is intended to allow students to graduate more quickly and with less debt. To be eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, a student must be otherwise eligible to receive Pell Grant funds and must be enrolled at least half-time in the payment period for which the student receives additional Pell Grant funds in excess of 100% of the student’s standard scheduled award.
     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
     The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has pursued enforcement actions against certain proprietary institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2017, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released its annual report analyzing more than 7,700 complaints the CFPB received from private student loan borrowers between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017 and more than 2,300 federal student loan financing complaints the CFPB received from federal student loan borrowers. We do not know what steps the CFPB or Congress may take in response to these actions and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
     U.S. Department of Education
     Title IV regulations applicable to Strayer University have been subject to frequent revisions, many of which have increased the level of scrutiny to which higher education institutions are subjected and have raised applicable standards. In addition to those regulations discussed above, on October 30, 2015, the Department of Education also published final regulations creating a new income-contingent repayment plan and implementing changes to streamline and enhance existing processes for borrowers. The regulations were effective July 1, 2016.
     On February 8, 2016, the Department of Education announced the creation of a Student Aid Enforcement Unit to enable the Department to respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions. The Enforcement Unit consists of four divisions, including an Investigations Group, a Borrower Defense Group, an Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group, and a Clery Group. The Enforcement Unit is designed to enable the Department to support more reviews of high-risk institutions, respond to concerns raised by states’ and other federal agencies’ investigations, and respond to complaints and claims for loan forgiveness by students. In August 2017,

the Department of Education announced a new leader of the Enforcement Unit, who will report to the head of the Department’s Compliance Unit.
     College Affordability and Transparency Lists
     The Department of Education publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (1) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (2) the highest “net price” for the most recent academic year, (3) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (4) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to the Department of Education explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. The Department of Education will report annually to Congress on these institutions and will publish their reports on its website. The Department of Education also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. Under HEOA, net price means average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted.     College Scorecard
     On December 19, 2014, the Department of Education issued a framework for a college ratings system, which was to include predominantly four-year and two-year institutions. On June 25, 2015, the Department of Education stated that in lieu of the previously announced college ratings system, it would instead create a consumer-driven website that will allow users to compare colleges based on measures that may be of importance to them. In September 2015, the Department of Education publicly released its “College Scorecard” website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. In October 2017, the Department of Education announced that its Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS, would publish for the first time completion data for part-time and non-first-time students, which will provide additional information about institutions’ performance.     Executive Order on Military and Veterans Benefits Programs
     In April 2012, President Obama issued an Executive Order directing the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, along with other Executive Branch agencies, to implement actions to establish “Principles of Excellence” to apply to educational institutions receiving funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs, including benefits programs provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the military tuition assistance program. The Principles of Excellence relate broadly to information regarding tuition and fees, academic quality, marketing, and state authorization requirements. The Principles of Excellence require federal agencies to create a centralized complaint system for students receiving federal military and veterans educational benefits to register complaints that relevant agencies can track and address. On January 30, 2014, the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Education, and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), in collaboration with the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice, announced a new online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Department of Defense tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs.
