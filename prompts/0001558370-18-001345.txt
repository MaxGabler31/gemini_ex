     Our Strategy
     Our overall business strategy is defined by our Drive for 10 vision, which at its highest level, is a mindset around perfection, with a greater sense of urgency around our future success. Launched in 2011, our Drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving long-term success. These five levers are:
· | Maximizing value in our existing businesses
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Expanding into new products and capabilities
--+---------------------------------------------


· | Aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Broadening our geographic reach and
--+------------------------------------


· | Leveraging our know-how and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through:
    
· | Seeking to deliver comparable diluted earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent per annum over the long-term
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximizing free cash flow generation
--+-------------------------------------


· | Increasing Economic Value Added (EVA®) dollars
--+-----------------------------------------------

      The cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company’s operations, (2) to fund strategic capital investments, (3) to service the company’s debt and (4) to return value to our shareholders via stock buy-backs and dividend payments. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or joint ventures. At any time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. There can be no assurance if or when we 

 
  1

 
will enter into any such transactions or the terms of such transactions. The compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our EVA®-based incentive programs.
     Our Reportable Segments
     Ball Corporation reports its financial performance in five reportable segments: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, South America; (3) beverage packaging, Europe; (4) food and aerosol packaging and (5) aerospace. Ball also has investments in the U.S., Guatemala, Panama, South Korea and Vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Financial information related to each of our segments is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (annual report).     Beverage Packaging, North and Central America, Segment
     Beverage packaging, North and Central America is Ball’s largest segment, accounting for 38 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages.
     Metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 19 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one in Canada and two in Mexico. Additionally, Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a joint venture owned 50 percent by Ball and 50 percent by a wholly owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, operates beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado.  
     The North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature. Where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products, Ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases primarily in its existing facilities to meet market demand. A meaningful portion of the industry-wide reduction in demand for standard 12-ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers and consumer demand. During 2016, we began production at our newly constructed beverage can and end manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
     According to publicly available information and company estimates, the North America, beverage container industry represents approximately 110 billion units. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Ball produced approximately 46 billion recyclable aluminum beverage containers in North America in 2017, which represented approximately 40 percent of the aggregate production in these countries. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the beverage containers produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are made of aluminum. In North and Central America, five suppliers provide the majority of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements.
     Beverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries.
     We believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.
     In order to better align our manufacturing footprint to meet the needs of our customers, the company announced in July 2015 the closure of its Bristol, Virginia, beverage end-making facility. The Bristol facility, which ceased production at the end of June 2016, produced beverage ends in a variety of sizes and its capacity was transitioned to existing North American Ball end-making facilities. In December 2016, the company announced the closure of its Reidsville, North Carolina, beverage packaging plant. The Reidsville facility, which ceased production at the end of June 2017, produced beverage cans in a variety of sizes and its customers are now supplied by the company’s other U.S. facilities. During the third quarter of 2017, the company announced the closure of its beverage can manufacturing facilities in Chatsworth, California, and Longview, Texas, and its beverage end manufacturing facility in Birmingham, Alabama. The Birmingham plant is currently expected to cease production by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and the Longview 

 
  2

 
and Chatsworth plants are currently expected to cease production by the end of the third quarter of 2018. The capacity from these locations will be transitioned to other North American Ball facilities. In order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans in the southwestern U.S., the company is constructing a beverage packaging facility in Goodyear, Arizona, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018.  
     Beverage Packaging, South America, Segment
     The beverage packaging, South America, segment, accounted for 15 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2017. Our operations consist of 14 facilities, 12 in Brazil and one each in Argentina and Chile. For the countries where we operate, the South American beverage container market is approximately 29 billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 55 percent of South American shipments in 2017. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in Brazil. 
     The company’s South American beverage facilities produced approximately 16 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2017. Historically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements.
     In order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, the company will construct a one-line beverage can and end manufacturing plant in Paraguay, and will add capacity to its Buenos Aires, Argentina, facility. The Paraguay plant is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
     We believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.
     Beverage Packaging, Europe, Segment
     The beverage packaging, Europe, segment, which accounted for 21 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2017.  Our European operations consist of 20 facilities throughout Europe. The European beverage container market is approximately 64 billion containers, including Russia, and we are the largest producer with an estimated 42 percent of European shipments. The European market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix. Four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in Europe. Our European beverage facilities produced 27 billion beverage containers in 2017, the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum. 
     Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in Europe tend to be highest during the period from May through August with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the U.K. offset by much lower demand in Russia. Much like other parts of the world, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink, beer, juice and water industries.
     European raw material supply contracts generally have longer term agreements. In Europe, five aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide almost all of our requirements. Aluminum is traded primarily in U.S. dollars, while the functional currencies of our European operations are various other currencies. The company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies. Purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed-price, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements.
     In order to support strong growth for beverage cans in the Iberian Peninsula, the company is constructing a two-line, aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near Madrid, Spain, with the majority of the new capacity secured under a long-term customer contract. The facility is expected to be fully operational in mid-2018 and will produce multiple can sizes. In the third quarter of 2017, our beverage packaging container and end production facilities in Recklinghausen, Germany, ceased production, and the capacity was transitioned to existing European Ball facilities.  
     Food and Aerosol Packaging Segment
     The food and aerosol packaging segment accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017. Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other products. The segment also manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers, as well as 

 
  3

 
extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs. There are 10 facilities in the U.S., four in Europe, two in Argentina, one in Canada, one in Mexico and one in India that manufacture these products. 
     We estimate our steel aerosol business accounted for 34 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel aerosol shipments in 2017. In the U.S. and Canada, we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be 77 percent. We estimate our extruded aluminum aerosol business accounted for 21 percent of total annual North American extruded aluminum aerosol shipments in 2017. Ball’s European aluminum aerosol shipments represented 20 percent of total European industry shipments in 2017. Historically, sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from May through October as a result of seasonal fruit, vegetable and salmon packs. We estimate our 2017 shipments of 3 billion steel food containers to be 11 percent of total U.S. and Canadian metal food container shipments.
     Cost containment and maximizing asset utilization are crucial to maintaining profitability in the metal food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and Ball is focused on doing so. During the first quarter of 2016, the company announced the closure of its food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and end-making facility in Weirton, West Virginia, which ceased production in the first quarter of 2017, and its production capacity was consolidated into other Ball facilities in the U.S. In October 2016, the company sold its specialty tin manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland. In March 2017, the company sold its paint and general line can plant in Hubbard, Ohio. 
     Competition in the U.S. steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers. Competitors in the metal food container industry include three national and a small number of regional suppliers and self-manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture steel food containers. Steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and aerosol products industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and pouches. As a result, profitability for this product line is dependent on price, cost reduction, service and quality. Two steel suppliers provide approximately 58 percent of our tinplate steel. We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs. We also mitigate aluminum cost changes through our self-supply of aluminum slugs and the use of aluminum scrap from our beverage can facilities. 
     Aerospace Segment
     Ball’s aerospace segment, which accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017, includes national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. The company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2017.
     Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry. It is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.
     Geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware. The businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations. 
     Other hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and associated sensor cooling devices; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace segment provides diversified technical services 

 
  4

 
and products to government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence, training and space system needs.
     Contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was $1.75 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The 2017 contracted backlog includes $844 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2018, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were $1.3 billion and $846 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Year-over-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards. Uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding, or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog.
     Other
     Other consists of non-reportable segments in Africa, the Middle East and Asia (AMEA) and Asia Pacific that manufacture and sell metal beverage containers.
     AMEA
     As part of the June 2016 Rexam acquisition, we added metal beverage container operations for the AMEA region, which consist of five aluminum container and end manufacturing facilities–two in India and one each in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, Rexam United Arab Can Manufacturing Limited, is a joint venture 51 percent owned by Ball and consolidated in our results. The beverage container market in these countries produced 24 billion cans in 2017, and we are one of four major producers in this region with 17 percent of shipments. Additionally, Ball has an ownership interest in an equity joint venture in South Korea. 
     In 2015, Rexam announced the establishment of a second metal beverage container facility in Sri City, India, near Chennai, which began production in the second quarter of 2017. 
     Asia Pacific
     The metal beverage container market in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is 41 billion containers, of which Ball’s operations represented an estimated 14 percent in 2017. Our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the PRC. We, along with five other manufacturers, account for 78 percent of the production. Our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in four facilities in the PRC and one aluminum container facility in Myanmar. Our aluminum can and end sheet requirements are provided by several suppliers.
     In May 2014, we announced the expansion of our Asian operations with the construction of a new one-line beverage can manufacturing facility in Myanmar, which began production in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, Ball has an ownership interest in an equity joint venture in Vietnam with Thai Beverage Can Limited, which manufactures two-piece aluminum cans and ends for beverages.
     Patents
     In the opinion of the company’s management, none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole. We manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives.     Research and Development
     Research and development (R&D) efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development of new features, sizes, shapes and types of containers, as well as new uses for existing containers. Other R&D efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products. Our packaging R&D activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in Westminster, Colorado.

 In our aerospace business, we continue to focus our R&D activities on the design, development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems. This includes the production of spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency and system components, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions. Our aerospace R&D activities are conducted at various locations in the U.S.
     Additional information regarding company R&D activity is contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report, as well as in Item 2, “Properties.”
     Sustainability
     Sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at Ball. In our global operations, we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety, energy, water, waste and air emissions. In addition to operational excellence, we identified product stewardship, talent management and community ambassadors as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts. Information about our corporate sustainability management, goals and performance data are available at www.ball.com/sustainability.
     By enhancing the unique sustainability credentials of our products along their life cycle, we position our metal containers as the most sustainable choice and help our customers grow their business. Because metal recycling saves resources and uses up to 20 times less energy than primary metal production, the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates. Aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials. They also have the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates. In 2017, aluminum beverage cans were confirmed to be the most recycled beverage package in the world, with a global weighted average recycling rate for aluminum at 69 percent. In comparison, 43 percent of PET and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected for recycling, although not necessarily recycled. In some of Ball’s markets such as Brazil, China and several European countries, recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are at or above 90 percent. The most recently available recycling rates in Europe are 73 percent for aluminum beverage containers in 2014 and 78 percent for steel containers in 2015. The most recently available recycling rates in the U.S. are 49 percent for aluminum beverage cans in 2016 and 71 percent for steel cans in 2014. 
     In markets where recycling rates are below expectations, we help establish and financially support packaging collection and recycling initiatives. These typically focus on collaborating with public and private partners to create effective collection and recycling systems, including education of consumers about the benefits of metal packaging. For details about programs we support, please visit www.ball.com/recycling.
     Employee Relations
     At the end of 2017, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 18,300 employees, including 8,100 employees in the U.S. Details of collective bargaining agreements are included within Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this annual report.     Where to Find More Information
