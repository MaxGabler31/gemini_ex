 Item 1. Business.
Corporate History and Background
 The original QuantumScape Corporation, now named QuantumScape Battery, Inc. (“Legacy QuantumScape”) was founded in 2010 with the mission to revolutionize energy storage to enable a sustainable future.
On November 25, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. (“Kensington”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) dated September 2, 2020, by and among Kensington, Kensington Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Kensington (“Merger Sub”), and Legacy QuantumScape.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between Kensington and Legacy QuantumScape was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy QuantumScape, with Legacy QuantumScape surviving as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kensington (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, Kensington changed its name to QuantumScape Corporation.
 Overview
 QuantumScape is developing next generation battery technology for electric vehicles (“EVs”) and other applications.
We are at the beginning of a forecasted once-in-a-century shift in automotive powertrains, from internal combustion engines to clean EVs. While current battery technology has demonstrated the benefits of EVs, principally in the premium passenger car market, there are fundamental limitations inhibiting widespread adoption of battery technology. As a result, we believe a new battery technology represents the most promising path to enable a mass market shift.
 After 30 years of gradual improvements in conventional lithium-ion batteries we believe the market needs a step change in battery technology to make mass market EVs competitive with the fossil fuel alternative.
 We have spent the last decade developing a proprietary solid-state battery technology to meet this challenge. We believe that our technology enables a new category of battery that meets the requirements for broader market adoption. The lithium-metal solid-state battery technology that we are developing is being designed to offer greater energy density, longer life, faster charging, and greater safety when compared to today’s conventional lithium-ion batteries.
 Since 2012, we have developed a strong partnership with Volkswagen Group of America Investments, LLC ("VGA") and certain of its affiliates (together with VGA, “Volkswagen”). Volkswagen is one of the largest car companies in the world and intends to be a leader in EVs. Over the last nine years Volkswagen has invested a total of more than $300 million in us and has established a 50-50 joint venture with us to enable an industrial level of production of our solid-state batteries. As 50-50 partners in the joint venture with Volkswagen, we expect to share equally in the revenue and profit from the joint venture. Over the course of our relationship, Volkswagen has successfully tested multiple generations of certain of our single-layer and early generations of our multi-layer laboratory cells at industry-accepted automotive rates of power (power is the rate at which a battery can be charged and discharged). We believe no other lithium-metal battery technology has demonstrated the capability of achieving automotive rates of power with acceptable battery life.
 While we expect Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize vehicles using our battery technology, over the next few years as we build our QS-0 and QS-1 facilities, we intend to work closely with other automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to make our solid-state battery cells widely available over time. As part of our joint venture agreement, we have agreed that QS-1 will be the first commercial-scale facility to manufacture our battery technology for automotive applications, but, subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs or other non-automotive companies to commercialize our technology. In 2021, we announced our plans to expand our manufacturing capability with the addition of QS-0. QS-0 is intended to have a continuous flow, high automation line capable of building over 200,000 engineering cell samples per year. We secured a long-term lease in April 2021 for QS-0, which we expect to be producing cells by 2023.
 Our development uses earth-abundant materials and processes suitable for high volume production. Our processes use tools which are already used at scale in the battery or ceramics industries. Outside of the separator, our battery is being designed to use many generally available materials and processes that are standard across today’s battery manufacturers. As a result, we expect to benefit from the projected industry-wide cost declines for these materials that result from process improvements and economies of scale. We believe that the manufacturing of our solid-state battery cells provides us with a structural cost advantage because our battery cells are manufactured without an anode.
 There are government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, use of batteries in cars, factory safety, and disposal of hazardous materials. We will ultimately have to comply with these regulations to sell our batteries into the market. The license and sale of our batteries abroad is likely to be subject to export controls in the future.

 Industry Background
 Shift to EVs
 We believe that evolving consumer preferences coupled with growing government incentives and regulations are driving a once-in-a-century shift to EVs.
 Countries around the world are promoting EVs. The dependence on gasoline-powered internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles has heightened environmental concerns, created reliance among industrialized and developing nations on large oil imports, and exposed consumers to unstable fuel prices and health concerns related to heightened emissions. Many national and regional regulatory bodies have adopted legislation to incentivize or require a shift to lower-emission and zero-emission vehicles. For example, over a dozen of countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, France and Norway have announced intentions to either increase applicable environmental targets or outright ban the sale of new ICE vehicles in the next two decades. In 2020, California passed regulations requiring half of trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035 and 100% by 2045. In 2021, the United States outlined the target of 50% EV sales share by 2030 and the European Union proposed an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035. This global push to transition from ICE vehicles, aided by favorable government incentives and regulations, is accelerating the growth in lower- and zero-emission vehicle markets.
 Furthermore, consumers are increasingly considering EVs for a variety of reasons including better performance, growing EV charging infrastructure, significantly lighter environmental impact, and lower maintenance and operating costs. Automakers such as Tesla, Inc. have demonstrated that premium EVs can deliver a compelling alternative to fossil fuels. As EVs become more competitive and more affordable, we believe that they will continue to take market share from ICE vehicles. We believe that this shift will occur across vehicle types and market segments. However, the inherent limitations of lithium-ion battery technology continue to impede improvements in EV competitiveness and cost.
 Current Battery Technology Will Not Meet the Requirements for Broad Adoption of EVs
 Despite the significant progress in the shift to EVs, the market remains dominated by ICE vehicles. According to BloombergNEF, approximately 7% of global sales of light vehicles in the first half of 2021 were electrified. For EVs to be adopted at scale across market segments batteries need to improve. In particular, we believe there are five key requirements to drive broad adoption of EVs:
 •Battery capacity (energy density). EVs need to be able to drive over 300 miles on a single charge to achieve broad market adoption. The volume required for conventional lithium-ion battery technology limits the range of many EVs. Higher energy density will enable automotive OEMs to increase battery pack energy without increasing the size and weight of the vehicle’s battery pack.
 •Fast charging capability. EV batteries need to be fast-charging to replicate the speed and ease with which a gasoline car can be refueled. We believe this objective is achieved with the ability to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in under 15 minutes, faster than today’s conventional batteries can deliver without materially degrading life.
 •Safety (nonflammable). EV batteries need to replace as many of the flammable components in the battery as possible with non-flammable equivalents to reduce the extent of damage caused by a fire. With current batteries, many abuse conditions, including malfunctions that can result in overcharges and battery damage from accidents, can result in fires.
 •Cost. Mass market adoption of EVs requires a battery that is capable of delivering long range while remaining cost competitive with a vehicle price point of around $30,000.
 •Battery life. Batteries need to be usable for the life of the vehicle, typically 12 years or 150,000 miles. If the battery fades prematurely, EVs will not be an economically practical alternative.

Since these requirements have complex interlinkages, most manufacturers of conventional lithium-ion batteries used in today’s cars are forced to make trade-offs. For example, conventional batteries can be fast-charged, but at the cost of significantly limiting their battery life.
 We believe that a battery technology that can meet these requirements will enable an EV solution that is much more broadly competitive with internal combustion engines. According to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d’Automobiles, more than 77 million ICE vehicles were produced in 2020 across the auto industry, representing a significant untapped demand for a battery that meets these requirements.
 Limitations of Conventional Lithium-ion Battery Technologies
 The last significant development in battery technology was the commercialization of lithium-ion batteries in the early 1990s which created a new class of batteries with higher energy density. Lithium-ion batteries have enabled a new generation of mobile electronics, efficient renewable energy storage, and the start of the transition to electrified mobility.
 Since the 1990s, conventional lithium-ion batteries have gradually improved in energy density. Most increases in energy density have come from improved cell design and incremental improvements in cathode and anode technology. However, there is no Moore’s law in batteries—it has taken conventional lithium-ion batteries at least 10 years to double in energy density and it has been approximately 30 years since the introduction of a major new chemistry. As the industry approaches the theoretical limit of achievable energy density for lithium-ion batteries, we believe a new architecture is required to deliver meaningful gains in energy density.
 Batteries have a cathode (the positive electrode), an anode (the negative electrode), a separator which prevents contact between the anode and cathode, and an electrolyte which transports ions but not electrons. A conventional lithium-ion battery (as shown in the figure below) uses a liquid electrolyte, a polymer separator, and an anode made principally of carbon (graphite) or a carbon/silicon composite. Lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charged and vice versa during discharge.
 Conventional Lithium-Ion Battery Design
 

The energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries is fundamentally limited by the anode, which provides a host material made of carbon and/or silicon to hold the lithium ions, preventing them from binding together into pure metallic lithium. Metallic lithium, when used with conventional liquid electrolytes and porous separators, can form needle-like crystals of lithium known as dendrites, which can penetrate through the separator and short-circuit the cell.
 While using a host material is an effective way to prevent dendrites, this host material adds volume and mass to the cell, adds cost to the battery, and limits the battery life due to side reactions at the interface with the liquid electrolyte. The rate at which lithium diffuses through the anode also limits the maximum cell power.

The addition of silicon to a carbon anode provides a modest boost to energy density relative to a pure carbon anode. However, silicon is also a host material that not only suffers from the limitations of carbon as discussed above, but also introduces cycle life challenges as a result of the repeated expansion and contraction of the silicon particles, since silicon undergoes significantly more expansion than carbon when hosting lithium ions. Furthermore, the voltage of the lithium-silicon reaction subtracts from the overall cell voltage, reducing cell energy.
 Lithium-Metal Anode Required to Unlock Highest Energy Density
 We believe that a lithium-metal anode is the most promising approach that can break out of the constraints inherent in conventional lithium-ion batteries and enable significant improvements in energy density.
 In a lithium-metal battery, the anode is made of metallic lithium; there is no host material. Eliminating the host material reduces the size and weight of the battery cell and eliminates the associated materials and manufacturing costs. This results in the highest theoretical gravimetric energy density for a lithium-based battery system. Lithium-ion batteries currently used in the auto industry have energy densities of less than 300 Wh/kg. We believe lithium-metal batteries have the potential to achieve significantly higher energy density.
 Lithium-metal anodes are generally compatible with conventional cathode materials, and lithium-metal batteries will derive some benefit from continued improvement in conventional cathode materials. Moreover, lithium-metal anodes may enable future generations of higher energy cathodes, such as the metal fluorides, that may not achieve significant energy density gains when used with lithium-ion anodes, as shown in the figure below.
 
Modeled Cell Specific Energy

 Note: Modeled cell specific energy is based on traditional cell designs and architectures.

Although the industry has understood for over 40 years the potential benefits of lithium-metal anodes, the industry has not been able to develop a separator that makes a lithium-metal anode practical for rechargeable applications.

Solid-State Separator Required to Enable Lithium-Metal Anode
 We believe that a lithium-metal battery requires that the porous separators used in current lithium-ion batteries be replaced with a solid-state separator capable of conducting lithium ions between the cathode and anode at rates comparable to conventional liquid electrolyte while also suppressing the formation of lithium dendrites, which are needle-like formations of lithium metal which can grow across the separator and short-circuit the cell. While various solid-state separators have been shown to operate at low power densities, such low power densities are not useful for most practical applications. To our best knowledge, we are the only company that has been able to demonstrate a solid-state separator for lithium-metal batteries that reliably prevents dendrite formation at higher power densities, such as those required for automotive applications and fast-charging.
 We believe that our ability to develop this proprietary solid-state separator will enable the shift from lithium-ion to lithium-metal batteries.
 
Our Technology
 

Our proprietary solid-state lithium-metal cell represents the next-generation of battery technology.
 Our battery cells have none of the host materials used in conventional anodes. In fact, when our cells are manufactured there is no anode. When the cell is first charged, lithium moves out of the cathode, diffuses through our solid-state separator and plates in a thin metallic layer directly on the anode current collector, forming an anode. When the battery cell is discharged, the lithium diffuses back into the cathode.
 Eliminating the anode host material found in conventional lithium-ion cells substantially increases the volumetric energy density. A pure lithium-metal anode also enables the theoretically highest gravimetric energy density for a lithium battery system.
 Our proprietary solid-state separator is the core technology breakthrough that enables reliable cycling of the lithium-metal anode battery. Without a working solid-state separator, the lithium would form dendrites which would grow through a traditional porous separator and short circuit the cell.

An effective solid-state separator requires a solid material that is as conductive as a liquid electrolyte, chemically stable next to lithium-one of the most reactive elements-and able to prevent the formation of dendrites. Our team worked over ten years to develop a composition that meets these requirements and to develop the techniques necessary to manufacture the separator material at scale using a continuous process. We have a number of patents covering both the composition of this material and key steps of the manufacturing process.
 


Our solid-state separator is a dense, entirely inorganic ceramic. As shown in the figure above, it is made into a film that is thinner than a human hair and then cut into pieces about the length and width of a playing card. Our solid-state separator is flexible because it has a low defect density and is thin. In contrast, typical household ceramics are brittle and can break due to microscopic defects which reduce structural integrity.
 The separator is placed between a cathode and anode current collector to form a single battery cell layer, as shown by the single layer pouch cell in the graphic above. Our single-layer solid-state cells have been extensively tested for power density, cycle life and temperature performance. This is the only solid-state cell we are aware of that simultaneously satisfies what we believe are the key requirements for automotive commercial usage (800 cycles while maintaining 80% energy retention, 100% depth of discharge, 1C/1C rates, <30°C temperature, <4 atm pressure) and that has been validated by independent testing.
 Our testing of single-layer battery cells shows that unlike previous solid-state efforts, our solid-state separators can work at high rates of power, with the ability to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in under 15 minutes, faster than today’s conventional batteries can deliver without materially degrading life. We also presented data showing our single-layer battery cell can work at a wide range of temperatures, including results that show cycling at –10°C.

The basic building block of our designed battery package is the bilayer cell, consisting of a double-sided cathode with a separator on either side. We stack these bilayer cells together to form multi-layer cells. Our form factor for EV batteries is targeted to be about the size of a deck of cards.
Multi-Layer Progress
 

Depending upon our potential customer’s requirements, our battery cell will require several dozen layers within each battery package. We have not yet built a complete multi-layer solid-state battery cell in the dimensions required for automotive applications but have announced the results of our single-layer, four-layer, and 10-layer cells. Those cells have reached over 800 cycles at near-room temperature (25 to 30 degrees Celsius) at 1C charge and discharge rates with energy retention maintained at more than 80%.
We need more production capacity to make the large number of multi-layer cells needed for testing and for process optimization, including yield improvement. We have ordered and continue to order new automation and high-volume tools that we expect to increase both output and repeatability; the nature of the task, and the development approach that we use, involves high velocity experimentation and a large number of samples.
 Our cathodes use a combination of conventional cathode active materials such as NMC or a cobalt-free, nickel-free composition like LFP with a catholyte made of an organic polymer and organic liquid. In the future, we may use other compositions of cathode active materials. Over the years, we have developed catholytes made of differing mixtures of organic polymer and organic liquid electrolyte to optimize performance across multiple metrics such as voltage, temperature, power, and safety, among others. We continue to test solid, gel and liquid catholytes in our cells. The solid catholyte is part of our ongoing research and development investigation into inorganic catholytes. Our solid-state separator platform is being designed to enable faster charge rates for thicker cathode electrodes, which when combined with a lithium-metal anode, may further increase cell energy densities.
 We believe our battery technology may provide significant improvements in energy density compared to today’s conventional lithium-ion batteries, as shown in the figure below.

 Benefits of Our Technology
 We believe our battery technology will enable significant benefits across battery capacity, life, safety, and fast charging while minimizing cost. We believe these benefits will provide significant value to automotive OEMs by enabling greater customer adoption of their EVs. By solving key pain-points such as 15-minute fast charging, we believe our battery technology will enable the delivery of an EV experience that is significantly more competitive with fossil fuel vehicles than what today’s EVs can achieve with conventional batteries.
 Our battery technology is intended to meet the five key requirements we believe will enable mass market adoption of EVs:
 •Energy density. Our battery design is intended to significantly increase volumetric and gravimetric energy density by eliminating the carbon/silicon anode host material found in conventional lithium-ion cells. This increased energy density will enable EV manufacturers to increase range without increasing the size and weight of the battery pack, or to reduce the size and weight of the battery pack which will reduce the cost of the battery pack and other parts of the vehicle. For example, we estimate that our solid-state battery cells will enable a car maker to increase the range of a luxury performance EV—with 350 liters of available battery space—from 250 miles (400 km) to 450 miles (730 km) without increasing the size and weight of the battery pack. In the same example, we estimate our battery would enable the car maker to increase the maximum power output of such a vehicle from 420 kW to 650 kW without increasing the size and weight of the battery pack. Alternatively, we believe that our solid-state battery cells will enable a car maker to increase the range of a mass market sedan-with 160 liters of available battery space-from 123 miles (200km) to 233 miles (375km) without increasing the size and weight of the battery pack. Similarly, we believe our battery would enable the car maker to increase the maximum power output of such vehicle from 100 kW to 150 kW without increasing the size and weight of the battery pack.

•Battery life. We designed our technology to enable increased battery life relative to conventional lithium-ion batteries. In a conventional cell, a reason that battery capacity fades over time is the gradual irreversible loss of lithium due to side reactions between the liquid electrolyte and the anode. By eliminating the anode host material, we expect to eliminate the anode side reaction and anode to enable longer battery life. Our single-layer, four-layer, and 10-layer prototype cells have been tested to over 800 cycles (under stringent test conditions, including 100% depth-of-discharge cycles at one-hour charge and discharge rates at 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and approximately 3.4 atm of pressure with approximately 3mAh/cm2 cathode loading) while still retaining over 80% of the cells’ energy. This performance exceeds the cycle life and capacity retention in many EV battery warranties today, which require that cells retain 70% of the rated capacity at 150,000 miles.
 •Fast charging capability. Our battery technology, and specifically our solid-state separator material, has been tested to demonstrate the ability to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in under 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius, faster than today’s conventional batteries can deliver without materially degrading life. In these conventional batteries, the limiting factor for charge rate is the rate of diffusion of lithium ions into the anode. If a conventional battery is charged at high rate, especially at high state-of-charge or low temperature, lithium can start plating on carbon particles of the anode rather than diffuse into the carbon particles. This causes a reaction between the plated lithium and liquid electrolyte which reduces cell capacity and increases the risk of dendrites that can short circuit the cell. With a lithium-metal anode, using our solid-state separator, we expect the lithium can be plated as fast as the cathode can deliver it.
 •Increased safety. Our solid-state battery cell uses a ceramic separator which is not combustible and is therefore safer than conventional polymer separators. This ceramic separator is also capable of withstanding temperatures considerably higher than those that would melt conventional polymer separators, providing an additional measure of safety. In high temperature tests of our solid-state separator material with lithium, the separator material remained stable in direct contact with molten lithium without releasing heat externally, even when heated up to 250 degrees Celsius, higher than the 180 degrees Celsius melting point of lithium.
 •Cost. Our battery technology eliminates the anode host material and the associated manufacturing costs, providing a structural cost advantage compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. When comparing manufacturing facilities of similar scale, we estimate that eliminating these costs has the potential to provide a cost savings compared to the costs of building traditional lithium-ion batteries.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Only lithium-metal battery technology showing capability to meet automotive requirements for power, cycle life, and temperature range to our knowledge. We have built and tested over 100,000 single-layer solid-state cells and have demonstrated that our technology shows the capability to meet automotive requirements for power, cycle life, and temperature range. In 2018, Volkswagen announced it had successfully tested certain of our single-layer, laboratory battery cells at automotive rates of power. Subsequently, Volkswagen has tested certain subsequent generations of laboratory cells, including multi-layer laboratory cells. In 2021, a second top ten (by global revenues) automotive OEM evaluated our early cells, with whom we signed an agreement for them to collaborate with us to evaluate prototypes of our solid-state battery cells, and to purchase 10 MWh of capacity from QS-0 for inclusion in pre-series vehicles, subject to satisfactory validation of intermediate milestones.
 Partnership with one of the world’s largest automotive OEMs. We are partnered with Volkswagen, one of the largest automakers in the world. Volkswagen has been a collaboration partner and major investor since 2012 and has invested a total of more than $300 million. In addition, Volkswagen has committed additional capital to fund the joint venture we have established with Volkswagen to enable an industrial level of production of our solid-state batteries for use in Volkswagen vehicles. As 50-50 partners in the joint venture with Volkswagen, we expect to share equally in the revenue and profit from the joint venture.
 High barriers to entry and extensive patent and intellectual property portfolio. Since inception, we have generated more than 250 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications – including broad fundamental patents around our core technology. Our proprietary solid-state separator uses the only material we know of that can cycle lithium at automotive current densities and room temperature without forming dendrites. We have a range of patents, including patents that cover:
 •Composition of matter, including the optimal composition as well as wide-ranging coverage of a number of variations;
 •Enabling battery technology covering compositions and methods required to incorporate a solid-state separator into a battery;
 •Manufacturing technology, protecting the way to make the separator at scale without semiconductor-style vacuum production or batch processes used in traditional ceramics; and
 •Material dimensions, including our proprietary solid-state separator, covering any separator with commercially practical thicknesses for a solid-state battery.

Significant development focused on next-gen technology for automotive applications. We have spent over ten years and over $350 million developing our battery technology. We have run over 4.4 million tests on over 1.1 million cells and cell components. Our technical team comprises more than 500 employees, many of whom have worked at large battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs. Through its experience, our team has significant technical know-how and is supported by extensive facilities and equipment, development infrastructure, and data analytics.
 Designed for volume production. Our battery cells are designed to use earth-abundant materials and processes suitable for high volume production. Our manufacturing process for our proprietary separator uses tools which are already used at scale in the battery or ceramics industries. While preparing for scale production, we have purchased or tested production-intent tools from the world’s leading vendors. In particular, we expect to produce our proprietary separator using scalable continuous processing. Although our separator material is proprietary, the inputs are readily available and can be sourced from multiple suppliers across geographies.
 Structural cost advantage leveraging industry cost trends. Aside from the separator, our battery is being designed to use many of the materials and processes that are standard across today’s lithium-ion battery manufacturers. As a result, we expect to benefit from the projected industry-wide cost declines for these materials that result from process improvements and economies of scale. We believe that the manufacturing of our solid-state battery cells provides us with a structural cost advantage because our battery cells are manufactured without an anode.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Continue to develop our commercial battery technology. We will continue developing our battery technology with the goal of enabling commercial production between 2024 and 2025. We have demonstrated capabilities of our solid-state separator and battery technology in single-layer, four-layer and 10-layer solid-state cells in commercially relevant areas (ranging from 60x75mm to 70x85mm). In February 2022, we announced early cycling test results for 16-layer cells also in a commercially relevant area. We must now develop multi-layer cells with commercial dimensions and many more layers, to continue improving yield and performance and to optimize all components of the cell for high volume manufacturing. We will continue to work to further develop and validate the volume manufacturing processes to enable high volume manufacturing and minimize manufacturing costs. We will continue to work on increasing the yield of our separators to reduce scrappage and to increase utilization of manufacturing tools. Finally, we will continue to use our engineering line in San Jose, California to prepare for high volume manufacturing and plan our first commercial production, QS-1, through our joint venture partnership with Volkswagen. In addition, we expect that QS-0 will help provide the additional capacity we need for our development work and will enable us to accelerate work on the next-generation of manufacturing tools. QS-0 is also intended to provide capacity to make enough batteries for hundreds of long-range battery electric test vehicles per year. This will allow us to provide early cells to Volkswagen, as well as other automotive partners, explore non-automotive applications, and help de-risk subsequent commercial scale-up. We secured a long-term lease in April 2021 for QS-0. We expect for QS-0 to be producing cells by 2023. Our current funds are sufficient to fund QS-0 expenses and the initial setup of the QS-1 production facilities.
 Meet Volkswagen battery demand. QS-1 to be built and run by our 50-50 joint venture entity with Volkswagen, QSV Operations LLC (“QSV”) and the subsequent QS-1 Expansion would represent a small fraction of Volkswagen’s demand for batteries and implies vehicle volumes under 2.5% of Volkswagen’s total production in 2021, assuming a 100KWh pack size. Our goal is to significantly expand the production capacity of the joint venture, in partnership with Volkswagen, to meet more of their projected demand.
 Expand relationships with other automotive OEMs. While we expect Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize vehicles using our battery technology, over the next few years as we build QS-1, we intend to work closely with other automotive OEMs to make our solid-state battery cells widely available over time. As part of our joint venture agreement we have agreed that QS-1 will be the first commercial-scale cell production facility to manufacture our battery technology for automotive applications, but, subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology, including the second top ten automotive OEM noted above. We expect that QS-0 will allow us to provide early cells to Volkswagen, as well as other automotive partners, explore non-automotive applications, and help de-risk subsequent commercial scale-up.
 Expand target markets. We are currently focused on automotive EV applications, which have the most stringent set of requirements for batteries. However, we recognize that our solid-state battery technology has applicability in other large and growing markets including stationary storage and consumer electronics such as smartphones and wearables. In January 2022, we announced an agreement to work with Fluence Energy Inc. to evaluate our batteries for inclusion in their stationary energy storage applications.
 Expand commercialization models. Our technology is being designed to enable a variety of business models. In addition to joint ventures, such as the one with Volkswagen, we may operate solely-owned manufacturing facilities or license technology to other manufacturers, such as our recently announced QS-0 facility that is planned for California. Where appropriate, we may build and sell separators or cell layers rather than complete battery cells.
 Continued investment in next-gen battery innovation. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve battery cell performance, improve manufacturing processes, and reduce cost.
Manufacturing and Supply
 Our battery manufacturing process is being designed to be very similar to that of conventional lithium-ion battery manufacturing, with a few exceptions:
 •We use a proprietary separator material instead of the polyolefin separator used in lithium-ion cells.
 •Our architecture eliminates the need for anode manufacturing, reducing capital investment and lowering operating costs.
 •We will build our multi-layer cells by sequentially stacking rather than winding cell materials together.
 •Our cell design allows us to greatly shorten the weeks-long aging process required for conventional lithium-ion cells, thus decreasing manufacturing cycle time and reducing working capital needs.
Our architecture depends on our proprietary separator, which we will manufacture ourselves. Though our separator design is unique, its manufacturing relies on well-established, high-volume production processes currently deployed globally in other industries.
 We plan to source our input materials from industry leading suppliers to the lithium-ion battery industry, and we already have strategic relationships in place with the industry’s leading vendors of cathode material, the most critical purchased input to our cell, along with leading vendors of other less critical inputs. Our separator is made from abundant materials produced at industrial scale in multiple geographies. We do not anticipate any unique supply constraints that would impede the commercialization of our product for the foreseeable future.
 Relative to conventional lithium-ion cells, our technology eliminates the anode material cost (e.g. carbon/silicon host material, electrolyte in the anode) and reduces manufacturing costs (e.g. no anode related manufacturing costs, reduced formation costs). This enables savings in materials, capital equipment and manufacturing time, as illustrated in the graphic below.
 



Partnerships
 Volkswagen Collaboration
 QuantumScape has had a strong collaborative relationship with Volkswagen since 2012. Our collaboration initially focused on the testing and evaluation of QuantumScape’s battery technology. Volkswagen engineers worked closely with our engineering team and oversaw the progress on our technology development efforts and battery testing. Volkswagen has made several rounds of equity investments in QuantumScape, and senior executives of Volkswagen joined our board of directors (the “Board”), including two successive heads of group research for the Volkswagen Group. During the early part of this collaboration we worked closely with members of Volkswagen’s global research and development team, and now the QuantumScape team works closely with the Volkswagen Battery Center of Excellence, which is tasked with commercializing battery technologies within Volkswagen. The Head of Volkswagen’s Battery Center of Excellence, Frank Blome, and the Head of Volkswagen Group M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships, Jens Wiese, are members of the Board.
Joint Venture Relationship
 In June 2018, we formed QSV, a 50-50 joint venture entity with Volkswagen focused on cell manufacturing, to facilitate the commercialization of our solid-state battery technology and enable Volkswagen to be the first automotive OEM to utilize this technology. In 2018, the parties collectively made an initial equity investment in the joint venture of approximately $3 million. Upon the occurrence of certain development milestones and subject to the entry by QuantumScape, Volkswagen and QSV into certain related agreements, QuantumScape and Volkswagen have agreed to commit additional capital on a 50-50 basis to QSV to fund the buildout of QS-1 and QS-1 Expansion cell manufacturing. As 50-50 partners in the cell manufacturing joint venture with Volkswagen, we expect to share equally in the revenue and profit from the joint venture, including from QS-1 and QS-1 Expansion. Under the joint venture agreements, QSV will purchase solid state separators from QuantumScape.
 The joint venture agreements were amended in 2020 in connection with a further $200 million investment commitment by Volkswagen in QuantumScape. $100 million of this equity investment by Volkswagen was funded in December 2020 and the second $100 million equity investment was funded in April 2021. As part of this equity investment, Volkswagen has the right to designate two members to our Board, who are currently Mr. Blome and Mr. Wiese.
The joint venture agreements provide for the commercialization of our solid-state battery cells to occur in two phases. The first phase is the construction of QS-1 with an annual capacity of 1GWh. QSV will begin construction of QS-1 when certain delivery and validation milestones are met for our solid-state battery cells. The second phase is QS-1 Expansion.
 We believe the joint venture structure will enable Volkswagen to benefit from early access to our solid-state battery cells, but also protect our intellectual property. For example, certain key battery technology will continue to be owned by us and will be provided to the joint venture through a limited license for purposes of QS-1. The parties will agree on the license terms for a high-volume manufacturing facility for this battery technology license. The joint venture terminates upon the earliest to occur of (i) Volkswagen exercising specified put rights in the event of, amongst others, (a) a change of control of QuantumScape, or (b) the failure by us to meet specified development milestones within certain timeframes, (ii) QuantumScape or Volkswagen exercising specified call or put rights in the event of, amongst others, if the parties cannot agree to commercial terms for QS-1 or QS-1 Expansion within certain timeframes, (iii) a certain date after commencement of production of a Volkswagen series production vehicle using our battery cells (or an alternative end date if no such production was commenced after certain technical milestones with respect to our battery cell technology were reached) and (iv) December 31, 2028.
 Volkswagen committed to purchase a certain portion of the output capacity of QS-1 at a price for the solid-state battery cells that is comparable to those of lithium-ion batteries, but with a premium for the outperformance of these battery cells based on certain key technical parameters. We will sell separators to the joint venture at a price to be agreed by the parties based on the provisions of the joint venture agreements. The joint venture agreements provide the framework for the commercial relationship. At the appropriate time, the parties will negotiate agreements covering the details of these purchase commitments.
 QS-1 Expansion is subject to meeting additional technical milestones and agreement on commercial terms, including pricing for the battery cells, agreement on the terms of purchase or license for the separators, and agreement on terms of the license to our battery technology for QS-1 Expansion. As 50-50 partners in the joint venture with Volkswagen, we expect to share equally in the capital contributions required for QS-1 Expansion and in the revenue and profit from QS-1 Expansion. We have agreed that the pricing for the battery cells sold by QS-1 Expansion and the separators purchased by QS-1 Expansion may be different from the pricing set for QS-1, and we will need to agree on pricing at the appropriate time. In addition, we will need to agree to the terms of the license to our battery technology for QS-1 Expansion.
 Volkswagen is expected to have a significant role in the manufacturing ramp-up of QSV, and we have agreed that certain technology that is developed by QSV will be owned by the joint venture and licensed to each of QuantumScape and Volkswagen on a royalty-free basis. None of this intellectual property has been developed to date. Although the parties have not commenced operations on QS-1, Volkswagen has offered to assist us with supply chain, manufacturing ramp-up planning, and automation. In addition, we have collaborated with Volkswagen on enabling us to develop stronger relationships with battery component supply companies, such as cathode manufacturers and equipment supply companies.

Research and Development
 We conduct research and development at our headquarters facility in San Jose, California. Research and development activities concentrate on making further improvements to our battery technology, including improvements to battery performance and cost.
 Our research and development currently includes programs for the following areas:
 •Multi-layering. We are working to continue increasing the number of layers in our cells. In 2021, we announced test results for our four-layer and 10-layer solid-state battery cells, and in February 2022, we announced early cycling test results for 16-layer cells, all in commercially relevant areas (ranging from approximately 60x75mm to 70x85mm). In order to produce commercially-viable solid-state battery cells, we must produce battery cells which will require several dozen layers, the exact number of which will depend on our customers’ requirements. We will need to overcome the developmental challenges to increase the layer count and implement the appropriate cell design for our solid-state battery cell.
 •Continued improvement in the solid-state separator. We are working to improve the quality and uniformity of our solid-state separators, to further improve, among other things, the cycling behavior, power, operating conditions of our cells and to continue to reduce separator thickness.
 •Improvement of our separator manufacturing process. We have selected a method of continuous processing found at scale in both the battery and ceramic industries and are working on continuous improvement of this process, including better consistency and higher throughput. Regarding consistency, tightening the variability of separator quality results in better yield. Regarding throughput, increasing the volume of separator production results in the increased quantities required for higher layer counts and delivery of more test cells to prospective customers. We are automating our manufacturing process and purchasing larger-scale manufacturing equipment. We will need to substantially improve our manufacturing processes to increase throughput required for higher layer counts and to achieve the cost, performance and volume levels required for commercial shipments.
 •Continued improvement of the cathode. Our cathodes use a combination of conventional cathode active materials such as NMC or a cobalt-free, nickel-free composition like LFP with a catholyte made of an organic polymer and organic liquid. In the future, we may use other compositions of cathode active materials. Over the years, we have developed catholytes made of differing mixtures of organic polymer and organic liquid electrolyte to optimize performance across multiple metrics such as voltage, temperature, power, and safety, among others. We continue to test solid, gel and liquid catholytes in our cells. The solid catholyte is part of our ongoing research and development investigation into inorganic catholytes. Our solid-state separator platform is being designed to enable faster charge rate for thicker cathode electrodes, which when combined with a lithium-metal anode, may further increase cell energy densities.
 Intellectual Property
 The success of our business and technology leadership is supported by our proprietary battery technology. We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies. In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and through non-disclosure agreements with business partners and other third parties. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we expect to do business. Our patent portfolio is deepest in the area of solid-state separators with additional areas of strength in anodes, next-generation cathode materials, and cell, module, and pack design specific to lithium-metal batteries. Our trade secrets primarily cover manufacturing methods.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned or licensed, on an exclusive basis, 92 issued U.S. patents and 49 pending or allowed U.S. patent applications, and 143 granted foreign patents and patent applications. We have 2 registered U.S. trademark and 5 pending U.S. trademark applications. Patents issued to us start expiring in 2033.
Competition
 The EV market, and the battery segment in particular, is evolving and highly competitive. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to increase in the future, which could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
 Our prospective competitors include major manufacturers currently supplying the industry, automotive OEMs and potential new entrants to the industry. Major companies now supplying batteries for the EV industry include Panasonic Corporation, Samsung SDI, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, LG Energy Solutions and BYD Co. Limited. They supply conventional lithium-ion batteries and in many cases are seeking to develop solid-state batteries, including potentially lithium-metal batteries. In addition, because of the importance of electrification, many automotive OEMs are researching and investing in solid-state battery efforts and, in some cases, in battery development and production. For example, Tesla, Inc. is building multiple battery gigafactories and potentially could supply batteries to other automotive OEMs, and Toyota Motors and a Japanese consortium have a multi-year initiative pursuing solid-state batteries.

A number of development-stage companies such as SES and Solid Power are also seeking to improve conventional lithium-ion batteries or to develop new technologies for solid-state batteries, including lithium-metal batteries. Potential new entrants are seeking to develop new technologies for cathodes, anodes, electrolytes and additives. Some of these companies have established relationships with automotive OEMs and are in varying stages of development.
 We believe our ability to compete successfully with lithium-ion battery manufacturers and with other companies seeking to develop solid-state batteries will depend on a number of factors including battery price, safety, energy density, charge rate and cycle life, and on non-technical factors such as brand, established customer relationships and financial and manufacturing resources.
 Many of the incumbents have, and future entrants may have, greater resources than we have and may also be able to devote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies. They may also have greater access to larger potential customer bases and have and may continue to establish cooperative or strategic relationships amongst themselves or with third parties (including automotive OEMs) that may further enhance their resources and offerings.
 Government Regulation and Compliance
 There are government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, use of batteries in cars, factory safety, and disposal of hazardous materials. We will ultimately have to comply with these regulations to sell our batteries into the market. The license and sale of our batteries abroad is likely to be subject to export controls in the future.
Employees
 We pride ourselves on the quality of our world-class team and seek to hire only employees dedicated to our strategic mission. Many of our employees have significant experience working with large battery manufacturers and automotive OEMS. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 570 employees, based primarily in our headquarters in San Jose, California. Over 500 of our employees are engaged in research and development and related functions, and more than half of these employees hold engineering and scientific degrees, including many from the world’s top universities.
 We seek team members who want to help solve a significant problem that will positively impact the world. We value diversity and recognize the importance of fostering a positive, inclusive culture. As such, we have actively taken steps towards eliminating unconscious bias in our hiring and promotion processes while enabling us to add and promote team members who demonstrate behaviors aligned with our values, including but not limited to delivering unconscious bias training to senior leaders, redesigning and enhancing hiring processes and establishing new college relationships to increase the diversity of our candidate pool.
 We are committed to maintaining equitable compensation programs including equity participation. We offer market-competitive salaries and strong equity compensation aimed at attracting and retaining team members capable of making exceptional contributions to our success. Our compensation decisions are guided by the external market, role criticality, and the contributions of each team member.
 To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
