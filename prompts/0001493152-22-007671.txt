ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
The Company:
 
Sigma is a software company that was founded by scientist-engineers composed of physicists and metallurgists then working at Los Alamos National Labs for the entrepreneurial purpose of developing sophisticated metallurgical products. Since 2016, the Company’s focus has been on solving the complex and challenging problem of how to best assure the high quality of metal parts manufactured in laser powder bed additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, machines. Sigma and many others believe that until this problem was solved, 3D manufacturing of metal parts would not be scalable enough to grow past prototyping and mature into a major industry enjoying high quality yields and cost-efficient production runs. The solution that Sigma developed to solve this problem is In-Process-Quality-Assurance (“IPQA®”) software known as PrintRite3D®.


In 2018, the Sigma team enhanced and added user features to its PrintRite3D® technology. In 2019, the Company began to productize and test PrintRite3D® on various 3D metal printers at customers’ sites through the Company’s Rapid Test and Evaluation (“RTE”) program. Upon receiving favorable responses from the various RTEs, in 2020 the Company began to aggressively market PrintRite3D®. However, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction, and in some cases a freeze, in capital spending within the Company’s targeted industries and had what the Company believes to be a short-term negative impact on the Company’s expected timing of generating meaningful revenue. Despite the pandemic, the Company moved forward with its plan to market PrintRite3D® to the following industry segments: (1) global manufacturing companies with Additive Manufacturing (“AM”) initiatives; (2) 3D printer Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) for purchases of licenses and generating fees and royalties thereafter; (3) additive manufacturing software venders for alliances and licenses for co-sales; and (4) research foundations, standards organizations and universities, all in service of Sigma’s potential for setting the industry standard of measurement by providing data and analytics as a metrics-based quality standard of metal quality for all 3D laser powder bed manufactured parts, notwithstanding the design, metal, or brand of equipment upon which parts are manufactured.
 
Additive Metal Manufacturing and the role and need for Sigma’s technology:
 
The use of 3D printing technology dates back to the 1980s for polymer applications, but the ability to print functional parts from metal alloys has spurred significant interest and investment into AM over recent years. AM is now reshaping the product design process, entire supply chains, and the vast landscape of manufacturing. Engineers are embracing new design freedoms to realize valuable product performance improvements and cost efficiencies with lighter weight, better thermal management capability, better fluid mixing, customization, and/or the ability to make different structures and textures that yield better part integration.
 
We believe that there are several significant hurdles to be overcome for broader adoption of additive technologies for the production of industrial metal parts. Among these are lack of quality, consistency, and industry standards along with cost. The Company believes PrintRite3D® has the potential to contribute to widespread industrialization of 3D metal printing. Additionally, the disruption in complex and rigid supply chains caused by COVID-19 exposed the country’s vulnerability to shortages in times of crisis. In response, manufacturers are devising strategies to be able to be more agile, increase their ability to manufacture mission critical parts on demand, with more customization, and closer to where the end part will be needed.

PrintRite3D® Technology and Product Family
 
PrintRite3D® is an integrated hardware and software edge computing platform, or in-process quality assurance system that combines inspection, feedback, data collection and critical analysis. It is a 3D printer platform-independent solution that can be installed as a retrofit to an existing 3D printer or requested as a factory option from select 3D printer OEMs. PrintRite3D® provides a high-fidelity, accurate system that can confidently scale to multi-laser 3D metal printers. The PrintRite3D® system detects potential anomalies and incorporates machine learning in conjunction with developed metrics to map those metrics to the post-process data. This provides the ability to reduce post-production testing and costs, while creating a certification framework that serves the needs of end-users, printer manufacturers, and standards organizations.
 
PrintRite3D was initially developed to work with industrial 3D metal printers using the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) process, which is the most widely used process for industrial metal applications. In 2020, we announced PrintRite3D for Direct Energy Deposition, or DED, for metal parts. PrintRite3D DED opens up another segment of the industrial metal market for Sigma to sell and distribute our technology. In 2021, the Company introduced PrintRite3D Selective Laser Sintering, or (SLS) for polymer materials. The polymer market is larger and more advanced than the metal market. There is an increasing need for quality and standards within the polymer market to support mission critical parts such as those being used in aerospace, space exploration, and defense. The Company’s entry into this market was customer driven by a supplier of critical equipment to the space exploration market. The Company believes that PrintRite3D’s ability to work across a different 3D printers, processes and materials gives it a competitive advantage and will help accelerate the adoption of 3D printing for industrial applications.


Distribution Methods
 
Sigma Labs employs a multi-channel distribution model for its IPQA products including a direct sales force, value added resellers (“VARs”) and 3D printer Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). In 2021, the majority of the Company’s revenue was generated by direct sales in North America and Europe. VARs are currently used in Japan and India. The Company plans to extend its VAR channel outside of North America and Europe. Since 2020, the Company has moved aggressively to establish and extend relationships with 3D printer OEMs and began to generate revenue from this channel. The revenue generated by the OEMs in 2021 did not meet the Company’s projections due to several reasons, including but not limited to: (1) the ramp up time for the OEM’s sales force, (2) the ongoing impact of COVID on our European based OEM partners, and (3) the lack of OEM sales into select vertical markets (e.g., aerospace and space exploration) that require that parts conform to specific quality standards. We expect that the percentage of the Company’s revenue coming from OEMs will increase in 2022 and beyond.
 
The Company markets its products through webinars, email and social media campaigns, and participation, both in person and virtually, in industry events and tradeshows. In addition, the Company collaborates with international standards organizations in the establishment of standards for AM.
 
Sources and Availability of Parts and Materials
 
We have important relationships with several suppliers for critical components of our PrintRite3D® systems, in particular optics and data acquisition components, and development of our user interface. To-date, we have not experienced shortages of components, however, in some cases COVID-19 has resulted in increased lead times and cost for certain parts. We manage the risk of component shortages by sourcing backup suppliers, and in the case of our user interface, hiring engineers in-house to support the ongoing development and maintenance.
 
Dependence on a Few Major Customers and Partners
 
The Company has established distribution agreements with two international 3D printer OEMs. We expected each to contribute a significant percentage of our 2021 revenue, however due to the previously discussed reasons, revenue in the first year of the relationship did not meet either company’s expectations. The Company supports the OEMs with joint marketing programs, field sales and technical support personnel to assist in the sale of its technology. It is the Company’s intent to continue to build the OEM channel through distribution relationships with other 3D printer OEMs in the future.
Competition
 
PrintRite3D® is a third-party, agnostic In-Process Quality Assurance system designed to provide a consistent, standards-based measurement and prediction of quality across a heterogeneous collection of 3D printers. Competition has been primarily from the printer OEMs who offer their own monitoring system, usually as a separately priced option to its printers. Sigma believes that the future of AM will consist of factories with various generations of printers from various manufacturers. The primary reasons that global manufacturers will have machines from various vendors is that certain machines and technologies are better suited for different applications than others. Additionally, as the industry progresses, innovation will accelerate, and new leaders will emerge. Finally, many believe that there will be a consolidation of 3D metal manufacturers and the number of vendors will decrease from approximately 50 to a much small number over the next decade. Although standards for monitoring are slowly being set by various international standards organizations, it is highly unlikely that printer OEMs will modify their monitoring systems to work with other OEMs machines. Therefore, we believe that the only way to produce parts with a consistent level of quality is with a third-party, agnostic, standards based IPQA system, such as PrintRite3D®. Over the past year or so, new competitors have entered the market with monitoring technology that follows Sigma’s lead as a 3rd party agnostic system capable of working across 3D printer machine types. These systems use camera-based technology and machine learning to identify gross defects during the printing process. These solutions are useful; however, they fall short of determining root cause, and unlike PrintRite3D, are not capable of instructing the printer, through closed-loop control, to vary certain machine variables such as laser power to avoid creating the defects.

Government Regulation
 
Any contracts that we enter into with governmental agencies will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are aimed at preventing the inadvertent disclosure of munitions related data or the export of technical knowledge to foreign countries. The work we do with governmental units may also be subject to laws respecting the confidentiality of any classified or national security information we receive during the course of our activities under any government contract.
 
Additionally, with respect to our work with government agencies, our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”), agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”). These agencies review a contractor’s performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and information systems.
 
As of March 23, 2022, we have several active contracts with government agencies. During fiscal year 2021, we entered into two contracts with government agencies, and we plan to increase this activity in the future.
 
 Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 33 full-time employees. We continue to search for additional, qualified personnel, to support our expanding operations in the area of IPQA® for AM. We believe that our future success depends, in part, upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees and management and technical personnel. Employee engagement is important to us and we focus on continuously enhancing our corporate culture.
Compensation and Benefits
