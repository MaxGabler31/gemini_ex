Item 1. Description of Business
 
CNBX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. is based in Bethesda, Maryland, is a clinical stage company dedicated to discovery, development and commercialization of novel cannabinoid-based products and innovative technologies for the treatment of cancer. Our first lead product candidate is a Cannabics SR, the oral capsule developed for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS). Our leading anti-neoplastic drug candidate under development for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is RCC-33.
 
Historically we were previously an exploration stage mining company which transitioned into a bio-tech company in 2014.
 
Our corporate address is #3 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite 700, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814; Telephone (877) 424-2429.
 
The Company was previously engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. On April 29th, 2014, the Company began a new direction and the majority of the Shareholders of the Company elected the Board of Directors and renamed the Company CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Company’s R&D is conducted in a Government licensed lab facility in Israel with the focus of development of cannabinoid-based therapies, medications and administration routes for treatment of cancer. 
History:
 
CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on September 15, 2004, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Thrust Energy Corp., for the purpose of acquiring undivided working interests in small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both producing and exploration projects throughout the United States and Canada.
 
On September 30, 2010, we increased our authorized capital to 900 million shares of common stock (par value $0.0001) and 100 million shares of preferred stock (par value $0.0001) and effected a 20-for-1 reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from 13,604,000 shares to 680,202 shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares.
 
Due to our inability to earn any meaningful revenue from oil and gas exploration, our management determined in April 2011 that we should change our business plan to include toll milling and refining.
 
On May 5, 2011, we effected a change of name to American Mining Corp. by completing a short form merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On April 25, 2014, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware Corporation, purchased 20,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, thus acquiring control of the Company.
 
On June 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-to-one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split was approved by FINRA on June 19th, 2014. The effect of the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 40,880,203 to 81,760,406. All common share and per common share data in these financial statements and related notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the stock split for all periods presented prior to June 3rd, 2014. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.
 
On June 19, 2014, FINRA granted final approval of Change of Name & Ticker Symbol of the Corporation from American Mining Corporation to CNBX PHARMACEUTICALS INC., with the new Ticker Symbol of “CNBX”. Said approval was predicated upon CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s filing of Articles of Merger with American Mining Corporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 21st, 2014. Under the laws of the State of Nevada, CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. was merged with and into the Registrant, with the Registrant being the surviving entity. The Merger was completed under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 92A, as amended, and as such, does not require the approval of the stockholders of either the Registrant or CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 
On July 24, 2014, the Company executed a Collaboration Agreement with Cannabics Inc. (“Cannabics”), a Delaware corporation and largest shareholder of the Company. Per the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued 18,239,594 shares of its common stock to acquire the entire institutional knowledge of Cannabics, Inc., which primarily consists of in-process Research & Development technology, the cumulative result of its years of scientific institutional knowledge in the fields of Molecular Biology, Cancer and Pharmacology research. Additionally, Cannabics tendered $150,000 to the Company specifically earmarked as working funds towards prospective projects of the Company. Per the Agreement, from that day forth they have carried forward their research and development as part of, and for the exclusive benefit of the Company, which initial findings have now branched out into new and divergent discoveries.

Company Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage company specializing in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel cannabinoid-based products and innovative technologies for the treatment of cancer.
 
Our first lead product candidate is Cannabics SR the oral capsule developed for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS), showed promising results in a peer-reviewed clinical study that concluded the results justify a larger clinical study. For oncology, we intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility. Our leading anti-neoplastic drug candidate under development for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is RCC-33, a first-in-class therapy being developed primarily in two settings: one to reduce tumor cell activity in CRC patients as a standalone in neoadjuvant treatment or “window of opportunity” at the time after colonoscopy, prior to cancer staging; and another for patients with refractory to therapy and adjuvant to surgery also at the time after colonoscopy. Neoadjuvant treatment is the administration of antitumor therapy as a first step to shrink a cancerous tumor prior to surgical intervention. We intend to initiate Phase I/II clinical trials for both candidates in 2023.

2. Development pipeline:
 
2.1. Cannabics SR for Cancer Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome
 
Overview
 
We are developing Cannabics SR as a product candidate for the treatment of CACS. Cannabics SR is a sustained-release oral capsule containing a standardized compound of cannabinoids that has demonstrated a clinically significant weight increase in CACS patients in a peer-reviewed pilot study conducted by Dr. Gil Bar-Sela of the Rambam Hospital Health Care Campus, Division of Oncology, in Haifa, Israel. Our patent-pending technology provides for a convenient, once or twice daily administration, with rapid onset and a steady state of therapeutic effect for a 6 to 8-hour duration.
Cancer Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome
 
CACS is a common complication of cancer associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is a complex metabolic syndrome in which a persistently elevated basal metabolic rate is not compensated for by adequate calorie or protein intake, causing involuntary and progressive weight loss leading to increasing functional impairment in cancer patients, especially in advanced stages of the disease. Once established, CACS cannot presently be reversed using available pharmacological or nutritional support techniques.
 
Unlike starvation, body-weight loss in CACS patients arises mainly from loss of muscle mass, characterized by increased catabolism of skeletal muscle and decreased protein synthesis. This weight loss is associated with important clinical outcomes such as increased morbidity, diminished effectiveness of chemotherapy, muscle wasting, inflammation, fatigue, and reduced survival expectations. The impact of CACS on the patient is not, however, limited to the effect of weight loss. Quality of life, functional abilities, symptoms, psychological outcomes, and social aspects are all affected by CACS.

According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly one-third of cancer deaths can be attributed to the severe weight loss and “metabolic mutiny” associated with CACS, and more than 50% of patients with cancer die with cachexia being present. The overall prevalence of CACS is currently estimated to range from 40% at cancer diagnosis to 70-80% in advanced phases of the disease (Source: Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology, 2013;88(3):625-636), while the overall prevalence of weight loss in cancer patients may be as high as 86% in the last 1-2 weeks of life (Source: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 2007;34:94–104).
 
The cause and subsequent development of CACS is still poorly understood, but several factors and biological pathways are known to be involved, including inflammation, decreased secretion of anabolic hormones, and altered metabolic response. While there have been important advances in the study of CACS over the past decade, including progress in understanding its mechanisms and the development of promising pharmacologic and supportive care interventions, there is presently no effective pharmacologic therapy for CACS.
 
Current treatments for CACS are generally based on nutritional support and CACS pathophysiology-modulating drugs, with the most common being the progestogens, megestrol and medroxyprogesterone, and corticosteroids. Progestogens appear to stimulate appetite and improvements in body weight by increasing adipose tissue, but have not been confirmed to augment lean body mass. Megestrol also carries an increased risk of mortality and thromboembolism. Nonetheless, megestrol is the only FDA approved treatment option for CACS and no drug to date has been shown to be superior to it in efficacy and tolerability. Corticosteroids are also considered effective in stimulating appetite and reducing fatigue but should only be used for short periods and in selected cases because of side effects from longer term use, such as insulin resistance, fluid retention, steroidal myopathy, skin fragility, adrenal insufficiency, and sleep and cognitive disorders. Other drugs are being investigated or are in development. Given the dearth of approved therapies, we believe that CACS remains a significant area of unmet medical need.
 
Cannabinoid Therapies for CACS
 
Cannabis has long been suggested as a well-tolerated, safe, and effective option to help patients cope with cancer related symptoms with fewer serious side effects than most prescription drugs currently used as anti-emetics, analgesics, and the like. As such, cannabinoids are finding application in palliative care for reducing nausea and vomiting, alleviating cancer pain, and stimulating appetite, as well as improving quality of life in cancer patients. Dronabinol (Marinol®) and nabilone (Cesamet®), two drugs based on synthetic cannabinoids, have each been approved by the FDA for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea in patients who do not respond to conventional antiemetic therapy. Another drug, nabiximols (Sativex®), a specific cannabis extract, is approved in Canada and the United Kingdom for symptomatic relief of pain in advanced cancer patients.
 
Despite interest in cannabinoid-based therapies as a treatment for CACS, their use has been limited by impediments beyond the legal status of cannabis. The most significant obstacle is the lack of clinical research demonstrating their efficacy. While there is evidence that cannabinoids improve appetite, body weight, body fat level, caloric intake, mood, and quality of life in cancer patients, the few studies on these effects have yielded mixed and inconclusive findings. In addition, some of these studies have suffered from methodological constraints that limit any ability to draw firm conclusions.
 
The therapeutic use of cannabinoids has also been inhibited by limitations associated with traditional administration routes that reduce their effectiveness. Smoking and ingestion of cannabis suffer from wide variability in potency due to a lack of standardized and reproducible formulations. The ingestion of unformulated cannabis has also been associated with poor absorption and low bioavailability versus other administration routes, requiring higher doses and a greater risk of negative side effects. Additionally, the lack of available information on cannabinoid strains has made it difficult for healthcare providers to establish dosing rates. In our experience, however, the principal concern of patients with respect to medical cannabis lies in the undesirable side effects, such as disorientation and dizziness, which result from significant variability in peak blood levels of active cannabinoids soon after administration. We further believe that these side effects, which are common among immediate release methods, are a significant factor in the failure of patients to adhere to recommended treatment regimens and are therefore a pervasive threat to their health and wellbeing.

Cannabics SR
 
Cannabics SR is an oral composition in the form of a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule containing a patent-pending formulation of cannabinoid extracts suspended in a lipid emulsion. It provides a relatively rapid onset of action, typically within 30-40 minutes, followed by a gradual and sustained release of active cannabinoids, resulting in a steady state level of beneficial effects for up to 6 to 8 hours with each capsule. Cannabics SR provides a consistent, predictable concentration of cannabinoids with an absorption profile and bioavailability of active ingredients that we believe to be superior to other oral cannabinoid administrations. We believe that the multifactorial benefits of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Cannabics SR address an unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment of CACS, leading to improved patient adherence and better health outcomes.
 
Cannabics SR capsules contain only food grade materials without any artificial additives. The active ingredients of each capsule are standardized in composition, formulation, and dose, and are comprised of only pure, natural extracts of active cannabinoids from selected strains of medical cannabis. All excipients are recognized by the FDA as Generally Regarded as Safe.
 
In addition to the therapeutic potential of Cannabics SR as a treatment for CACS, we believe that our SR technology may be formulated to serve the unique needs of patients suffering from other indications for which a sustained release of a cannabinoid formulation may be beneficial.
 
Clinical Development
 
In 2016, we commenced a two-year pilot study to evaluate the influence of Cannabics SR capsules on CACS, and, in particular, on weight loss in advanced cancer patients. The study was led by Professor Gil Bar-Sela, the former Deputy Director of the Division of Oncology at Rambam Health Care Campus, Head of the Palliative and Supportive Oncology Unit, and Head of Service for Melanoma and Sarcoma Patients.
 
Patients were administered 2 × 10 mg of Cannabics SR per 24 hours for six months. During the study, after some patients reported several psychoactive side effects, the dosage of each capsule was reduced to 5 mg. Almost no side effects were reported with the 5 mg dosage. Participants were weighed at each physician visit. The primary objective of the study was a weight gain of ≥10% from baseline. Of 24 patients who agreed to participate in the study, 17 started the Cannabics SR treatment, but only 11 received the capsules for more than two weeks. Three of six patients who completed the study period met the primary end-point. The remaining three patients had stable weights. In quality-of-life questionnaires patients reported less appetite loss after the Cannabics SR treatment (p=0.05). According to patients’ self-reports, improvement in appetite and mood as well as a reduction in pain and fatigue was demonstrated.
 
Despite various limitations, the preliminary study demonstrated a weight increase of ≥10% in 3 out of 17 (17.6%) of patients with doses of 5 mg × 1 or 5 mg × 2 capsules daily, without significant side effects. The remaining patients had stable weights. Also, all patients who remained in the study for at least 4.5 months reported an increase in appetite, as did 83% of the patients who completed the study. For 50% of the patients who completed the study, there were reports of pain reduction and sleep improvement. Additional results showed a significant decrease of appetite loss complaints among 83% of the patients who completed the study. (See Bar-Sela, Gil et al. “The Effects of Dosage-Controlled Cannabis Capsules on Cancer-Related Cachexia and Anorexia Syndrome in Advanced Cancer Patients: Pilot Study.” Integrative Cancer Therapies vol. 18 (2019): 1534735419881498. doi:10.1177/1534735419881498.)

Commercialization
 
The results of our planned pilot studies may permit us to commercialize Cannabics SR in Israel under license by the Israeli Ministry of Health. If we are granted such a permit, we intend to engage a GMP manufacturer in Israel to produce Cannabics SR capsules for national distribution.
 
On May 13, 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Economy signed a Free Export Order, authorizing the export of GMP certified medical cannabis products from Israel. We are currently evaluating our export opportunities and optimal commercialization path for Cannabics SR across all available international markets, particularly with regard to the European Union, Canada, and Australia. 
 
Cancer and Cancer Anorexia Cachexia Syndrome (CACS) Market Analysis
 
The dynamics of the cancer cachexia market are expected to shift in the coming years as a result of the positive outcomes of some of the rare candidates during the development stage by key players that are in the early stages of clinical development have the potential to create a significant positive shift. The emerging therapies are projected to be launched during the forecast period. In addition, the dearth of effective therapies for this condition presents a great opportunity for pharma companies to create novel drugs because there is less competition in the cancer cachexia market. Moreover, the rising awareness about the condition is also impacting the growth of the cancer cachexia market positively.
 
The Global Cancer Cachexia Market Size is projected to reach USD 2.93 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period [2020-2027].

2.2 RCC-33: colorectal cancer treatment drug candidate:
 
Our anti-neoplastic flagship product under development, RCC-33, is an antitumor drug candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer, which is the 3rd most diagnosed and 2nd most lethal of all cancers, with approximately 2M new cases being diagnosed annually worldwide and a current market estimated at $12B, and which is expected to reach $17B by 2027.
 
The RCC-33 proprietary formula consists of a specific synthetic cannabinoid molecular composition that has demonstrated the potential to reduce colorectal cancer tumor volume by over 30% in repeated in-vivo studies performed.
 
Overview
 
Cancer and Cannabinoids
 
Cancer is a general term used to describe a group of more than 100 related diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, leading to the development of a mass commonly known as a tumor, followed by invasion of the surrounding tissues and subsequent spread, or metastasis, to other parts of the body. Despite enormous investment in research and the introduction of new treatments, cancer remains a critical area of unmet medical need. According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for an estimated nearly 10 million deaths in 2021. As of January 1, 2019, there were more than 16.9 million people with a history of cancer living in the United States, with 1.9 million new cases and 609,360 cancer deaths expected in 2022 (Source: American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2022).
 
Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in the therapeutic value of cannabinoid compounds in oncology. Cannabis has long been suggested as a well-tolerated, safe, and effective option to help patients cope with cancer related symptoms by reducing nausea and vomiting, alleviating cancer pain, stimulating appetite, and improving quality of life. Beyond their palliative benefits, however, cannabinoids have also been receiving increased attention for their anti-cancer potential, which we believe may one day revolutionize cancer therapy.
 
Cannabinoids are a diverse class of chemical compounds that occur naturally within cannabis plants and are pharmacologically similar to cannabinoids produced by the human body, known as endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids form part of the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), a complex biological network that also includes cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in cannabinoid formation, transport, and degradation. The ECS is regarded as an important endogenous system implicated in regulation of the most vital biological processes to maintain homeostasis, assisting the body to remain stable and balanced despite external, or environmental, fluctuations (Source: Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2016;22(12):1756-1766).
 
Dysregulation of the ECS owing to variation in the expression and function of cannabinoid receptors or enzymes or the concentration of endocannabinoids has been associated with several diseases, including cancer (Source: International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2020;21(3):747). Indeed, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the ECS as well as the processes that it regulates include practically every pathway important in cancer biology. Expression of the ECS is altered in numerous types of tumors, compared to healthy tissue, and this aberrant expression has been related to cancer prognosis and disease outcome, depending on the origin of the cancer (Source: British Journal of Pharmacology, 2018;175(13):2566-2580). Recent studies suggest that endocannabinoids contribute to maintaining balance in cell proliferation and that targeting the ECS can affect cancer growth (Source: Canadian Urological Association Journal, 2017;11(3-4):E138-E142).
 
Cannabinoids can interact with the cannabinoid receptors in the ECS, sometimes with a higher affinity than endocannabinoids. As a consequence, all the processes regulated by endocannabinoids are susceptible to interference by cannabinoids. The ability to use cannabinoids to modulate the ECS encompasses several attractive pharmacotherapeutic targets for systemic anti-cancer treatment and has sparked considerable research examining cannabinoid action on cancer cells (Source: Pharmacological Reviews, 2006;58(3):389-462).

Cannabinoids have demonstrated selective anti-tumor properties in preclinical studies, exerting anti-proliferative, proapoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory effects depending on tumor type and specific setting (Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018:7(3):765-775). These effects appear to be more pronounced when cannabinoids are used together versus being administered separately, a mechanism known as the entourage effect. We believe, therefore, that cannabinoid combinations may hold promise for an improved anti-proliferative strategy for cancer management.
 
In addition to their potential role as anti-cancer agents, cannabinoids have been observed to act synergistically with some conventional antineoplastic drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents, enhancing their effectiveness (Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018;7(3)765-775). This raises the potential for combinational therapies that may increase the range of chemotherapeutic options available to patients and enable targeting of tumor progression at different levels while also permitting dosages of cytotoxic drugs to be dramatically reduced without compromising efficacy.

As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any cannabinoid-based therapies approved for the anti-cancer treatment.
 
Our lead product candidate is RCC-33, which we are developing as a treatment for CRC. RCC-33 is an oral capsule containing a proprietary formulation of cannabinoids that have demonstrated synergistic efficacy in reducing the viability of human colon cancer cell lines in preclinical studies.
 
Colorectal Cancer
 
CRC is one of the more common forms of cancer worldwide, representing a significant challenge to the global healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization, CRC is the third most diagnosed cancer in the world and the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In the United States, there were approximately 1,369,005 people living with CRC in 2019(Source: National Cancer Institute. “Cancer Stat Facts: Colorectal Cancer”). In 2022, an estimated 151,030 cases of colon cancer and 44,850 cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed in the US, and a total of 52,580 people will die from these cancers (Source: American Cancer Society. “Cancer Facts & Figures 2022”).
 
Most CRCs begin as a noncancerous growth called a polyp that develops on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. The most common kind of polyp is called an adenomatous polyp or adenoma. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated one-third to one-half of all individuals will eventually develop one or more adenomas. Although all adenomas have the capacity to become cancerous, fewer than 10% are estimated to progress to invasive cancer. The likelihood that an adenoma will evolve into cancer increases as it becomes larger or when it acquires certain histopathological characteristics. Adenomas that become cancerous, called adenocarcinomas, comprise nearly 96% of all CRCs (Source: American Cancer Society. “Colorectal Cancer Facts & Figures 2020-2022”). Adenocarcinomas may grow into blood vessels or lymph vessels, increasing the chance of metastasis to other anatomical sites.

CRC usually develops slowly, over a period of 10 to 20 years. The complex sequence of events occurring during initiation, development and propagation of adenocarcinomas is likely the result of a lifelong accumulation of mutations caused by both genetic and environmental factors known as the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. While the specific cause of any particular case of CRC is often unknown, more than one-half of all cases and deaths are attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, unhealthy diet, high alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and excess body weight (Source: American Cancer Society. “Cancer Facts & Figures 2020”).
 
CRC does not usually cause symptoms until the disease is advanced, therefore early detection of adenomas by screening is vital. If not treated or removed, an adenoma can become a potentially life-threatening cancer.
 
Current Standard of Care
 
Treatment options for CRC patients depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient’s preferences and overall health. Surgical removal of the tumor is the most common form of treatment, particularly in the early stages of malignancy. Patients with more advanced stages of CRC may be given adjuvant chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells remaining after surgery, though standard chemotherapy is associated with severe side effects and provides marginal benefit to the majority of patients. While radiation therapy is often used to treat rectal cancer, it is not generally recommended for colon cancer patients except in the later stages of the disease (Source: American Cancer Society. “Treating Colorectal Cancer”).
 
CRC is a heterogeneous disease with distinct clinical, molecular, and pathophysiological characteristics. As a result, the response to treatment is variable between patients, even when they are diagnosed at the same clinical stage. Such heterogeneity remains an obstacle to the optimization of treatment for each individual. Researchers are continuing to investigate new treatment options, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy, that focus upon the genes, proteins, and other factors in a particular tumor (Source: American Cancer Society. “Advances in Colorectal Research”).
 
Immunotherapy uses the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells. There are already several FDA-approved immunotherapy options for CRC, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), nivolumab (Opdivo®), and ipilimumab (Yervoy®). Many immunotherapies that have shown promise in addressing other types of cancer are also being tested for CRC. While immunotherapy has had some encouraging results, significant limitations remain. Its efficacy is often unpredictable, and the treatment can lead to the body becoming resistant or result in off-target toxicities where the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue. Immunotherapy may take longer than other protocols and it is substantially more expensive than classical treatments (Source: Pharmacy & Therapeutics, 2017;42(8):514-521).
 
Targeted therapy uses drugs to target specific molecules inside cancer cells or on their surface to slow the growth of cancer, destroy cancer cells, and relieve cancer symptoms. There are different types of targeted therapy drugs, each working differently depending on what molecule the drug is targeting. A treatment is chosen based on the types of molecules expressed on the patient’s tumor cells, which allows doctors to tailor cancer treatment for each person. Several targeted therapy drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avasin®) and cetuximab (Erbitux®), are already used to treat advanced CRC. Despite showing clinical promise, targeted therapy has challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity, off-target toxicity, and acquired resistance (Source: Medical Research Journal, 2019;4(2):99-105). The lack of biomarkers by which to identify patients having a high probability of response is also a particularly significant obstacle. As with immunotherapy, the cost of targeted therapy is substantially higher than classical treatments.
 
We believe that there is no “magic bullet” to cure cancer and that a personalized combination of cancer treatments may be the best course for long term survival benefits in each case. To that end, the development of more prevention strategies and novel agents will be essential.
 
Cannabinoids and Colorectal Cancer
 
One area of increasing interest in the treatment of CRC lies in the development and use of cannabinoid therapeutics. The ECS is regarded as an important regulatory system in the gastrointestinal tract, being involved in several important functions such as motility, secretion, sensation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Recent studies advocate that the ECS plays a critical role in the development of CRC and should therefore be considered as an appropriate target for CRC inhibition (Source: Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2016;7:361). The expression of ECS components in CRC has been found to be increased and associated with poorer prognosis and advanced stages of disease (Source: Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research, 2018, 3(1):272-281). For example, cannabinoid receptors have been found to be overexpressed in tumor cells of the colon and this up-regulation has been postulated to be an indicator of cancer outcome (Source: British Journal of Pharmacology, 2018; 175(13): 2566-2580).

Research on the effects of cannabinoid compounds on CRC has demonstrated an ability to reduce the viability of CRC cell lines in vitro (Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018;7(3):765-775), while there is also convincing scientific evidence that cannabinoids are able to prevent or reduce carcinogenesis in different animal models of colon cancer (Source: Expert Review of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 11:10, 871-873).
 
We believe that cannabinoids are a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of CRC. We have conducted several in vitro unpublished studies using our bioinformatics platform to confirm that cannabinoids cause necrosis in colon cancer cells. While many cannabinoids demonstrate levels of toxicity on cancer cells, we have found that certain cannabinoid extracts and combinations show increased levels of toxicity relative to other isolated or combined cannabinoids. These findings have spurred the development of RCC-33, our product candidate for the treatment of CRC.
 
Figure 3: Synergistic effects of different cannabinoid combinations on viability of a colon cancer cell line.
 

RCC-33
 
We are developing RCC-33 as an oral capsule or solution containing high concentrations of the cannabinoids CBDV and CBGA in a novel formulation, which we believe may be effective in the treatment of adenocarcinomas of the colon. The cannabinoids in RCC-33 have demonstrated complex synergistic anti-tumor effects in combination, with no psychoactive effect. In our preclinical in vitro studies evaluating the influence of 15 different cannabinoids on human colon cancer cell lines (RKO, HCT116), alone and in combination, RCC-33 demonstrated clear efficacy in reducing the viability of colon cancer cells versus alternative cannabinoid combinations. Importantly, we could detect significant reduction effect on tumour development in mice inoculated with human colorectal cancer cells.

Development Plan
 
The company is currently preparing to launch Phase I/II (a) clinical study in 2023, for the evaluation of its lead drug candidates Cannabics SR for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS) and RCC-33 for the treatment of colorectal cancer. We plan to conduct further preclinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy before proceeding with first-in-human clinical testing.
Preclinical Studies
 
We plan to conduct non-clinical safety studies following Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) to evaluate the systemic and local toxicity of escalating doses of RCC-33 and establish dosing parameters. The results of these preclinical studies, which are expected in 2023, will guide our planned Phase I/II(a) clinical trial. The non-clinical requirements to support the development program will be verified with the FDA at a pre-IND meeting. Such studies may include repeated dose toxicity studies, male and female fertility studies, embryofetal development studies, animal abuse related studies, pharmacokinetics studies, drug-drug interaction studies, and others.
Clinical Trials
 
We plan to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of Cannabis SR and RCC-33 in a Phase I/II(a) ascending dose clinical trial in CRC patients, commencing in the first quarter 2023. The clinical trial will examine the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of multiple doses of RCC-33 in CRC patients. We are currently identifying potential contract research organizations and clinical trial centers to conduct the Phase I/II(a) human proof of concept study, which is estimated to cost $6,500,000. As of the date of this filing, however, the Company does not have sufficient funds to complete the Phase I/II(a) study.
 
Subject to the results from our Phase I trials, we plan to submit an IND to the FDA for RCC-33 with the clinical protocol for a Phase II double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating RCC-33 in patients with CRC at various dosing levels versus placebo. The outcomes from the planned Phase II human proof of concept trial will inform our decision regarding further steps in the clinical development of RCC-33.
 
Our Pipeline:
 
In addition to RCC-33, our colorectal cancer treatment drug candidate, the company has several other drug candidates under development, including PLP-33 for the local treatment of Lateral Spreading, or Sessile, colorectal polyps during colonoscopy, BRST-33 for the treatment of breast cancer, MLN-33 for the treatment of Melanoma and PRST-33 for the treatment of prostate cancer. These additional drug candidates are in the early stage of development and the company expects to complete the in-vivo research for each product by end of 2023. (see Fig. 4).

2.3 Product lines currently not actively developed:
 
The company has several product lines that are currently not being actively developed following company’s decision to focus its resources and attention exclusively on the development of its FDA route drug candidates, and SR Capsule described above. The product lines not actively developed include:
Cannabics CDx (evaluate) Drug Sensitivity Test
 
Cannabics CDx is an ex-vivo drug sensitivity test under development to provide healthcare providers with clinical decision support data from which they can identify, for a particular cancer patient undergoing cannabinoid therapy, which cannabinoids or cannabinoid combinations may have the most beneficial anti-cancer effects, and which cannabinoids may be contraindicated.
 
Company may revisit this decision at a later stage after launching the first in human clinical studies for the validation of its colorectal cancer treatment drug candidate RCC-33.

3.       Market opportunity for cancer treatment drug candidates:
 
3.1.  Neoadjuvant therapy:
 
According to the National Cancer Institute, Neoadjuvant Therapy is a "treatment given as a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery”.
 

Limitations:
 

· | Mild to severe side effects 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Suppressed immune system 
· | Potential resistance of tumor residues to postoperative chemotherapy *

 
* “nCRT increases ITGH and may result in the expansion of resistant tumor cell populations in residual tumors”.

3.1.1    Neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer
 
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy not only can reduce tumor size and recurrence, but also increase the tumor resection rate and anus retention rate with very slight side effect. Comparing with preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative chemoradiotherapy can further reduce the local recurrence rate and downstage. Middle and low rectal cancers can benefit more from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy than high rectal cancer.
 




3.1.2    Neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer
 
In early breast cancer, surgery is the mainstay of curative treatment. Complementary local radiotherapy and systemic - adjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy treatments are associated with the aim of reducing the risk of relapse according to the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumor. However, the possibility of administering these therapies prior to surgery in neoadjuvant setting offers several advantages:
 

· | reduction in tumor size to improve respectability, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | increased rate of conservative surgery improving esthetic results,
· | reduction in the extent of axillary surgery, 
· | early treatment of micrometastatic disease

According to ASCO guidelines most of the patients are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are the end consumers of BRST-33, while the current treatment regimen negates severe side effects.
 
Side effects and risks of standard of care:
 

· | nausea or vomiting

· | hair loss 
· | nail or skin changes 
· | appetite loss 
· | weight changes 
· | diarrhea or constipation

3.2.  Cannabinoid Neoadjuvant Therapy
 
For some time now, the FDA has promoted clinical studies on Cannabinoids as a growing range of stakeholders has expressed interest in development of drugs that contain cannabis and compounds found in cannabis. Recent legislative changes have also opened new opportunities for medical cannabis clinical research. As this body of research progresses and grows, the FDA is working to support drug development in this emerging scientific arena.
 
RCC-33 & BRST-33 – Potential safe drugs improving rectal and breast cancer neoadjuvant standard of care
 
RCC-33 & BRST-33 anticipated advantage over standard of care:
 

· | Non-Suppressed immune system 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | potential low toxicity which is even more important in neoadjuvant treatment since patients will suffer less side effects. Since the two drug candidates are based on two natural molecules (cannabinoids) found in the Cannabis plant, the safety of the molecules in the short and long run is potentially lower. Not like in a new drug entity in which toxicity could not be predicted.
· | Overcoming Potential resistance of tumor residues to postoperative chemotherapy 

3.3. Cancer Immunotherapy:
 
Our business strategy is to advance our programs through clinical studies with partners, and to opportunistically add programs in areas of high unmet medical needs through acquisition, collaboration, or internal development. Despite significant advances in oncology, there is still a large unmet need in treating patients with solid tumors, especially those with advanced disease who are refractory or unresponsive to currently available drugs. A business and clinical synergism of CNBX Pharmaceuticals and Tageza Pharmaceuticals is advancing towards unique therapeutics and optimizing their combination to expand oncology treatment options to cancer patients. The team work will be a unique collaboration of experienced scientist, physicians and exceptional healthcare research professionals. Within the partnership, CNBX Pharmaceuticals leverages it’s the cutting-edge infrastructure platform to support Tageza at various stages of drug development, including, target validation, compound validation and pre-clinical and clinical trial optimization. From Tageza Pharmaceutical partnership side, the clinical experience from one of the biggest Oncology Centers, access to data and insights as a result of large cohorts of patients during treatment, can be validated to determine patients who are most likely to benefit from novel cannabinoid treatments.
 
Patients undergoing most of currently existing treatments benefit a reduction in tumor size but often relapse and develop more aggressive disease. The residual population of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells is enriched by Tumor Initiating Cells (TIC) previously known as cancer stem cells (CSC). The TaGeza technology is targeting TIC/ CSC by re- purposing small molecules and generating specific antibody generation for targeted immunotherapy ADC (Antibody drug conjugates).
 
CSCs were first found in colorectal cancer. Because of its heterogeneity, drug resistance etc., it was difficult to completely eliminate CSCs using traditional treatment methods. The remaining CSCs can cause tumor recurrence and invasion, and ultimately the death of the patient. Therefore, developing a therapy that can effectively target CSCs will greatly promote the treatment of GI cancers (Sun, Y., Li, B., Cao, Q. et al. Targeting cancer stem cells with polymer nanoparticles for gastrointestinal cancer treatment. Stem Cell Res Ther 13, 489 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-022-03180-9)
 
Antibody Drug Conjugates ADC
 
Antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) is a new emerging class of highly potent pharmaceutical drugs, which is a great combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) is typically composed of a monoclonal antibody (mAbs) covalently attached to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker. It combines both the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and highly potent killing effect to achieve accurate and efficient elimination of cancer cells, which has become one of the hotspots for the research and development of anticancer drugs. Since the first ADC, Mylotarg® (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), was approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have been 14 ADCs received market approval so far worldwide. Moreover, over 100 ADC candidates have been investigated in clinical stages at present. This kind of new anti-cancer drugs, known as “biological missiles”, is leading a new era of targeted cancer therapy. The target antigen expressed on tumor cells is the navigation direction for ADC drugs to identify tumor cells and it also determines the mechanism (e.g., endocytosis) for the delivery of cytotoxic payloads into cancer cells. Hence, an appropriate selection of target antigen is the first consideration for the designation of ADC. In order to reduce off-target toxicity, the targeted antigen firstly should be expressed exclusively or predominantly in tumor cells, but rare or low in normal tissues.22 The antigen is ideally a surface (or extracellular) antigen (Fu, Z., Li, S., Han, S. et al. Antibody drug conjugate: the “biological missile” for targeted cancer therapy. Sig Transduct Target Ther 7, 93 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-00947-7) The ADC Market indicators

Global sales of currently marketed ADCs are forecast to exceed US$16.4 billion in 2026. The market for ADCs is set to grow further beyond 2026, as novel agents enter clinical practice across several oncology indications. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-021-
 
  4. Outsourced GMP manufacturing and commercial operation:
 
4.1.  Outsourced GMP manufacturing
 
Our current position is that all of our Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) required for the approval process of our drug candidates is to be outsourced. The RCC-33 formulation, as well as all additional drug candidates in our pipeline, while inspired by natural molecules, could consist only of formulations made from chemically synthesized molecules, or APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients). Our Company is not engaged in the development of any botanical or botanically based product/s. Additionally, in view of our upcoming submission of a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA, the Company has entered an agreement with Purisys, a supplier of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) grade APIs suited for Clinical Stage Products. Purisys is a large and long-established US corporation with a long track record of working with the FDA. Accordingly, under said agreement, Purisys will also support CNBX throughout an IND filing process, including providing all necessary and related information concerning CMC in the form of a comprehensive technical package to be presented to the FDA. APIs supplied under said agreement will be used by Company in Phase I/II (a) clinical studies that it is planning to launch in 2023.
 
4.2.  Commercial Operations
 
We have not established a sales, marketing, or product distribution infrastructure. We plan to commercialize any drugs we develop through licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships with established companies in the pharmaceutical industry having strong marketing capabilities and distribution networks. We generally intend to advance our drug candidates through Phase I and Phase II clinical trials as appropriate in order to establish their clinical and commercial potential before negotiating the terms of any licensing or collaboration. We believe that this approach will achieve the fullest marketing and distribution potential of any drugs or other products that we may develop in the short term.
 
5.       Core activities:
 
5.1.  Drug Discovery
 
Conduct all screening and pre-clinical research at in-house state of the art laboratory facilities
 
Our Research and Development:
 
To address these problems and improve clinical outcomes, CNBX Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of diagnostics that monitor cancer progression and cannabinoid-cancer sensitivity tests to tailor treatment of cancer with cannabinoid medicine. Utilizing novel High-Throughput Screening (HTS) methods to perform studies on cancer cell lines and on circulating tumor cells (CTC) derived from cannabis medicated patients.
 
We aim to treat a wide scope of cancers both as the main treatment and as a conjugate to conventional chemotherapy. We believe a significant need remains for novel drugs for patients who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies bear undesirable side effects. We recognize the potential therapeutic applications of the synergistic effects of these active compounds thus building the methodology and procedures that decipher specific ratios of active compounds in regard to their antitumor activity.
 
Our government licensed laboratory operates a unique, custom designed and built research and development laboratory which combines high throughput screening, (HTS) capabilities with the most advanced data tools allowing us to enable miniaturization and automation of a variety of biological assays. The automated system is comprised of:
 

1. | High Content Screening (HCS) Platform, which is an automated cellular imaging and analysis platform designed for quantitative microscopy.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Flow Cytometry, which enables multi-parametric single cell analysis.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Automated workstation, for liquid handling for dispensing accurate and reproducible volumes of liquids and compounds.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Multimode microplate reader, designed for fast measurements of numerous biological reactions/processes.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The integration of these instruments is enabled via a robotic arm, which allows a continuous process which utilizes all instruments.
 
Readouts generated from these instruments provide us with insights to the effect of our cannabinoid library on parameters such as, proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, angiogenesis prevention and toxicity on cancerous cells.
 
These experiments will produce multiplexed data composed of images of cells, cell specific markers and the extent/signal of the biological response. The biological response will be measured using different concentration of cannabinoids and their combinations, thus determining the most effective cannabinoid treatment for a specific cancer type.
 
In vitro Studies – Drug Screening
 
We have a proprietary procedure of high throughput screening (HTS) and high content screening (HCS) for the detection of correlations between cannabinoid ratios, dosages and anti-tumor activity using a growing library of human cancer cell lines and creating an enlarged variety of Cannabis-based compounds. We examine the biological activity of these compounds on tumor cell lines of distinct tissue lineage and creating a highly valuable therapeutic data. We Screen for the most potent cannabinoid/natural extracts. Our goal in the invitro studies is to build a library of both purified and natural cannabinoid extracts and to reveal their biological impact on a library of cancer cell lines. The HTS technology enables us to gain this data base in a faster manner and to reveal more mechanisms of action that are related to the genetics of the cancer. We are now in the process of merging our data with sophisticated data mining to help find meaningful insights of both treatment and outcome.
 
Our core technology is a continuously evolving bioinformatics platform that utilizes high-throughput screening technology, advanced data analytics, and proprietary methodologies to rapidly examine the physiologic effect of multiple cannabinoid compounds on tumor cells. This technology enables us to screen thousands of cannabinoid combinations, generating multiple datasets on the anti-tumor properties of different cannabinoid formulations and ratios. We conduct a broad range of preclinical research on cannabinoids through our bioinformatics platform, which informs the development of our product drug candidates.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | fully integrated in-house research and development; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


Ø | regulatory expertise.
--+----------------------

 
Once a series of potentially active cannabinoids is identified for a specific cancer type, we then test and confirm their activity through in vitro and ex-vivo evaluation studies to determine their potential activity. Through this process, we are able to assess their therapeutic potential. The results of our pre-clinical experiments provide starting points for our clinical development programs.

6.  Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe that our scientific knowledge, experience, technology and development capabilities provide us with competitive advantages, but we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we have, as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing products, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals.
 
As the medical use of cannabis increasingly receives government approval worldwide, we face growing competition from many new and existing companies seeking to develop cannabinoid-based therapies. Companies currently known to be developing cannabinoid-based human therapeutics include GW Pharmaceuticals PLC, Cannabis Science Inc., InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Emerald Bioscience Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc., PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc., Tetra Bio-Pharma Inc. and Cure Pharmaceutical Holding Corp.
 
Many of our competitors are conducting research targeting the same technologies, applications, and markets as we are. Consequently, they may develop products for the same indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful, and less costly. Any products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products, as well as those currently in development or that may become available in the future.
 
In addition to competing for market position, we will also compete in terms of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, acquiring intellectual property, establishing clinical trial sites, and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in obtaining funding.
 
Given the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies in general and cannabis-related medical research and development in particular, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Time-to-market is a critical factor in our industry and our success will depend on our ability to timely develop innovative technologies that will be accepted by patients. Our competitors may be better able to react to market changes, respond more rapidly to new regulations, or allocate greater resources to the development of their products than we can, which may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we are able to enter the market, recover the expenses incurred to develop them, or generate significant revenue. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to develop our product candidates in a timely manner, keep our future products current with advancing technologies, achieve market acceptance of our future products, gain name recognition and a positive reputation in the healthcare industry, and establish successful marketing, sales, and distribution efforts. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously harm our business prospects.

7.  Competitive Factors
 
The Pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with many other and better financed companies. We are a clinical stage and early stage-biotech pharmaceutical company, with relatively deminimis cash flow. We compete with other early-stage bio-tech and pharmaceutical companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in early-stage development companies. The presence of competing early-stage pharmaceutical companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our research and development if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on their subjective analysis of our company, the general market conditions and the price of the investment offered to investors.
8.  Regulations
 
CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. is purely a Bio-Technology Pharmaceutical company which licenses use of its Intellectual Property, it does not produce, manufacture or provide any product in any location. We are duly licensed by the Israeli Health Ministry for our research in Israel. Beyond the Israeli Health Ministry (by whom we are licensed) and the FDA regulatory pathway for our drug candidates as described above, we are not under the aegis of any Federal or State regulatory scheme as we have no manufacturing activity. Any licensee whom we engage must be duly licensed and certified according to all pertinent local government regulations in their jurisdiction. The Company is exploring drug development within approved laboratory clinical trial settings conducted within approved regulatory frameworks. Should any prescription drug product be developed by the Company, such drug product will not be commercialized prior to receipt of applicable regulatory approval, which will only be granted if clinical evidence of safety and efficacy for the intended use(s) is successfully developed.
United States
 
In the U.S., the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of any prescription drug product candidates or commercial products. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
 
Cannabis (other than hemp) is strictly controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”) as a Schedule I substance. Schedule I substances by definition have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. Anyone wishing to conduct research on substances listed in Schedule I under the CSA must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), and obtain DEA approval of the research proposal. For any product containing cannabis to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, cannabis must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Scheduling determinations by the DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance.
 
The process required before a prescription drug product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
 

· | completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory, Good Clinical and/or Manufacturing Practice regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | approval by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
· | for some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the prescription drug product candidate for each proposed indication; 
· | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); 
· | Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
· | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the Company cannot be certain that any approvals for its prescription drug product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
An independent institutional review board, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An independent institutional review board considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The independent institutional review board also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the independent institutional review board, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity, or NME.

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either a n approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs and indications which are designed to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These include programs such as Breakthrough Therapy designations, Fast Track designations, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, which the Company may need to rely upon in order to receive timely approval or to be competitive.
 
The Company may plan to seek orphan drug designation for certain indications qualified for such designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which, in the U.S., is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the development, review and approval process. However, this designation provides an exemption from marketing and authorization fees.
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including current Good Manufacturing Practices, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.
 
Controlled Substances
 
The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics.
 
For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the number of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 
Individual U.S. states also establish and maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.

9.  Employees
 
As of August 31, 2022, the Company had 5 employees, two of which were our Directors Gabriel Yariv and Eyal Barad, which along with our counsel and CFO were given monthly salaries. Aside from counsel, all employees reside in Israel.
 
Israeli labor laws principally govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have defined benefit pension plans that comply with applicable Israeli legal requirements, which also include the mandatory pension payments required by applicable law and allocations for severance pay.
