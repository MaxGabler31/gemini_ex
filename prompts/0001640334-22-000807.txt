Platinum HK was established on May 4, 2020 under the laws of Hong Kong as a limited liability company. Platinum HK acquired all of the outstanding stock of Yubo WFOE on September 11, 2020. 

Yubo WFOE was established on September 4, 2020, under the laws of the PRC. Yubo WFOE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Platinum HK, and therefore, Yubo WFOE is a wholly foreign owned enterprise. The advantages of this structure include:


· | Independence and freedom to implement the worldwide strategies of its parent company without having to consider the involvement of Chinese law; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Ability to formally carry out business and the ability to issuing invoices to customers in RMB and receive revenues in RMB; 
· | Capable of converting RMB profits to US dollars or other foreign currency for remittance to their parent company outside China; and 
· | Greater protection of intellectual property rights, know-how and technology since no partner required and therefore more control of intellectual property.

On December 31, 2020, Platinum HK formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Yubo Global Biotechnology (Chengdu) Co. Ltd. (“Yubo Global”).

On January 21, 2021, Yubo formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Jingzhi Biotechnology (Chengdu) Co. Ltd. (“Yubo Jingzhi”).

Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote with respect to all matters to be acted on by the stockholders; and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to five votes per share, and is convertible into one share of Class A common stock.

The VIE and China Operations

As a result of the Exchange Transaction, we became a U.S. holding company primarily operating through our wholly owned subsidiary, Platinum. Platinum is not a Chinese operating company but a Cayman Islands holding company which in turn operates in China through (i) its Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries, including Yubo Jingzi , Yubo Global, and Yubo International Biotech (Chengdu) Limited, a company organized under the laws of the PRC (the “Yubo WFOE” or “WFOE”), in which we hold equity ownership interests, and (ii) Yubo Beijing, a Chinese operating company that conducts the day-to-day business operations in China as descried in this Annual Report. We do not own any equity interest in Yubo Beijing.

We manage Yubo Beijing through our WFOE. On September 11, 2020, our WFOE entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing and its shareholders, allowing us to exercise effective control over Yubo Beijing. These agreements include:


5


· | Exclusive Consulting Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Exclusive Consulting Services Agreement, WFOE agrees to provide, and Yubo Beijing agrees to accept, exclusive management services provided by WFOE. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Exclusive Option Agreement. Pursuant the Exclusive Option Agreement, the Yubo Beijing Shareholders granted WFOE an irrevocable and exclusive purchase option to acquire Yubo Beijing’s equity and/or assets at a nominal consideration. WFOE may exercise the purchase option at any time. 
· | Equity Pledge Agreement. Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Yubo Beijing Shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in Yubo Beijing, including the proceeds thereof, to guarantee all of WFOE’s rights and benefits under the Exclusive Consulting Services Agreement and the Exclusive Option Agreement.


We do not have any equity ownership interest in, direct foreign investment in, or control through such contractual agreements of Yubo Beijing. As a result of our contractual relationships with Yubo Beijing, we consolidate Yubo Beijing’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements and are the primary beneficiary of Yubo Beijing for accounting purposes only. Our corporate structure involving the VIE provides investors with contractual exposure to foreign investment in China-based companies where PRC laws prohibit direct foreign investment in Chinese operating companies in certain industries, such as Yubo Beijing. This structure involves unique risks to investors. For example, management through these contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct ownership, and we could face heightened risks and costs in enforcing these contractual arrangements, because there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations, and rules relating to these contractual arrangements. Our contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing have not been tested in a court of law. If the PRC government finds such agreements non-compliant with relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in Yubo Beijing or forfeit our rights under the contractual arrangements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.” 

The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, including Yubo Beijing, as of the date of this Annual Report:

Business Strategy

Yubo Beijing intends to build a first-class stem cell storage facility, which we believe, will be the first global bank of endometrial stem cells. Yubo Beijing also intends to develop and expand its current product line, to include a series of endometrial stem cells light application technology and medical-grade cell therapeutic products for health management, innovative medicine, anti-aging treatments, clinical transformation and other application fields. We believe Yubo Beijing’s existing technology and leadership position in stem cell processing will drive significant future growth for the company. 
Stem Cell Storage Facility

The endometrial stem cell bank is divided into a public resources library and private repositories. The public resources library will meet strict testing standards. Yubo Beijing will enter into standard donation agreements with the donor customers who meet the public resources library standards, and store the collection of stem cell samples in the public resources library. Such public resources library biological samples can be widely used in research and development and subsequent commercial development. See “—Services and Products—Endometrial Stem Cell Bank” below for a detailed discussion regarding the regulatory approvals, operational steps and construction timeline in connection with the stem cell bank. 
Business Model

Yubo Beijing’s business model leverages its ability to integrate the upstream, middle stream and downstream of its stem cell based product cycle. With respect to the upstream of the industrial chain, Yubo Beijing intends to build a public resource library of endometrial stem cells to meet the demand for high-quality cells from stem cell application and treatment centers in China. See “—Business Strategy—Stem Cell Storage Facility” above and “—Service and Products—Endometrial Stem Cell Bank” below. With respect to the middle and downstream of the industrial chain, Yubo Beijing intends to open and operate biological experience center stores where it integrates the functions of display, trial and sale of its light application products under the brand “VIVCELL”, and at the same time, can train and develop its sales personnel. By continuing to build and develop the “VIVCELL” brand, it plans to expand the biological experience center stores into a nationwide franchise. We believe Yubo Beijing’s integrated approach provides it with a competitive advantage. 
Service and Products

Endometrial Stem Cell Bank

Effective March 1, 2021, we, through Yubo Global, entered into a lease agreement with Chengdu Liangkang Investment Co. to rent approximately 6,960 square meters of laboratory space in Chengdu, China for the use of the endometrial stem cell bank and subsequent research and development laboratory. See “Item 2. Properties.” In addition, Yubo Beijing has entered into an Entrustment Technical Service Agreement with Beijing Zhenhuikang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the PRC, entrusting it to prepare, store and manage endometrial stem cell samples for the operations of the stem cell bank in exchange for services fees paid by Yubo Beijing. Beijing Zhenhuikang Biotechnology Co., Ltd is an affiliate of a shareholder of Yubo Beijing. Pursuant to the entrustment agreement, Yubo Beijing is responsible for supplying the endometrial stem cell samples and Yubo Beijing may terminate the agreement at any time. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Related Party Transactions.”

Subsequent to the entry into the lease and the Entrustment Technical Service Agreement, Yubo Beijing has completed the design for the stem cell bank and obtained a business license for the stem cell bank from the Market Supervision Administration of Chengdu Municipality. The establishment of the stem cell bank has been submitted for filing with the Chengdu Municipal Development and Reform Commission, the Science and Technology Bureau and the Health Commission. The blue print design of the stem cell bank has been approved by Health Commission and Fire and Rescue department.

Yubo Beijing intends to recruit young, healthy adult females as the donors of endometrial stem cells. Yubo Beijing plans to target these donors via several channels, including from its existing clients for cell testing and health management consulting services, from colleges and universities where it promotes the knowledge and awareness of the application of endometrial stem cells, and from its existing customers of light application products. Yubo Beijing has launched an educational program about the benefits and applications of endometrial stem cells among the existing customers of light application products, although it has not attempted to recruit any donors to date.

We expect that Yubo Beijing will complete the first stage of building the stem cell bank, which mainly consists of tenant improvement and equipment procurement, by June 2022. Yubo Beijing may begin recruiting qualified donors after the completion of the first stage when the stem cell bank becomes operational. The stem cell bank is expected to be fully operational at its designed capacity by 2024.

Research and Development 

Yubo Beijing is principally focused on the development of new products that support the stem cell therapy market. Yubo Beijing’s future research and development activities will be devoted to the development and launch of additional new products, line extensions, or significant upgrades to existing products and its current stem cell storage facility. Research and Development expense reflects the cost of these activities, as well as the costs to obtain regulatory approvals of new products and processes and to maintain the highest quality standards with respect to existing products.

Yubo Beijing has entered into a Joint Research and Development Agreement with Beijing Zhenxigu Medical Research Center (L.P.) (“Beijing Zhengxigu”), which is controlled by a shareholder of Yubo Beijing, on February 17, 2020. Pursuant to this agreement, Yubo Beijing agreed to pay Beijing Zhenxigu RMB241,880 in connection with the research and development relating to the medical fluid used in the nebulizers Yubo Beijing sells to customers. Under this agreement, Beijing Zhenxigu authorized Yubo Beijing to be the nationwide exclusive distributor of such medical fluid for Platinum-branded nebulizers. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Related Party Transactions.”

Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property is of vital importance in the field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of the business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally, acquired or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, inclusion in expedited development and review, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.

Competition

Yubo Beijing’s products will compete with novel therapies developed by biomedical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, in addition to standard of care treatments. 

According to a market research conducted by Shenzhen Forward Industry Research Institute in 2021,, there are approximately 77,990 companies engaged in stem cell collection and storage, research and development, and application in China The application of stem cell products mainly include treatment of disease, organ transplantation, and aesthetic medicine. Due to Yubo Beijing’s unique core technology, we believe there is no company in China whose main business is endometrial stem cell storage. At present, we believe no companies mainly engage in cell light application products and have product lines similar to Yubo Beijing’s products.

Some of Yubo Beijing’s key competitors are:


· | China Cord Blood (NYSE: CO) currently focuses on private storage of neonatal cord blood and is the largest company engaged in such business in China, with annual revenue of more than RMB1.2 billion in 2021, according to its annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.

In order to attract, retain and reward top talents in the industry, Yubo Beijing is considering establishing various incentive programs for its employees, and it may establish an equity incentive plan in the future. 

COVID-19

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Most U.S. states and many countries have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease. 

Covid-19 and the U.S’s and China’s responses to the pandemic are significantly affecting the economy. There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the Covid-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the effects on the economy, the markets we serve, our business, or our operations.
