Item 1.Business
General Overview
New Media Investment Group Inc. (“New Media,” “Company,” “Successor,” “us,” or “we”) is a company that owns, operates and invests in high-quality local media assets. We have a particular focus on owning and acquiring strong local media assets in small to mid-size markets. With our collection of assets, we focus on two large business categories: consumers and small to medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”).
Our portfolio of media assets today spans across 569 markets and 38 states. Our products include 678 community print publications, 569 websites and two yellow page directories. As of December 31, 2017, we reach over 22 million people per week and serve over 215,000 business customers.
Our business strategy is to be the preeminent provider of local news, information, advertising, and digital and business services in the markets we operate in. We aim to grow our business organically through both our consumer and SMB strategies. We also plan to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of high-quality local media and digital marketing assets at attractive valuation levels. Finally, we intend to distribute a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations or other sources as a dividend to stockholders through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or “Board”) and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. 
We believe that our focus on owning and operating leading local-content-oriented media properties in small to mid-size markets puts us in a position to better execute on our strategy. We believe that being the leading provider of local news and information in the markets in which we operate, and distributing that content across multiple print and digital platforms, gives us an opportunity to grow our audiences and reach. Further, we believe our strong local media brands and our market presence gives us the opportunity to expand our advertising and lead generation products with local business customers. 
For our SMB category, we focus on leveraging our strong local media brands, our in-market sales force and our high consumer penetration rates with a variety of technology oriented products and services that solve acute pain points for SMBs. Central to this business strategy is our wholly-owned subsidiary UpCurve, Inc. ("UpCurve"). UpCurve provides two broad categories of services: ThriveHive, previously known as Propel Marketing, which provides marketing services for every SMB regardless of size, and UpCurve Cloud which offers best-in-breed cloud-based products with expert migration, integration, and support. ThriveHive is designed to offer a complete set of turn-key digital marketing and business services to SMBs that provide transparent results to the business owners. In 2016, we acquired a turn-key proprietary software that enables SMB owners to run their own digital and contact marketing campaigns. 
We launched the UpCurve products in 2012 and have seen rapid growth since then. We believe UpCurve, combined with our strong local brands and in-market sales force, is positioned to continue to be a key component to our overall organic growth strategy. The opportunity UpCurve aims to seize upon is as follows:
There were approximately 29.6 million SMBs in the U.S. in 2014 according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Of these, approximately 29.0 million had 20 employees or less.
Many of the owners and managers of these SMBs do not have the resources or expertise to navigate the fast evolving digital marketing and cloud based service sectors, but are increasingly aware of the need to embrace the digital disruption to their business model. 
We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure are uniquely positioned to sell these digital marketing and business services to local business owners and give us distinct advantages, including:

• | our strong and trusted local brands, with 85% of our daily newspapers having published local content for more than 100 years;


• | our ability to market through our print and online properties, driving branding and traffic; and


• | our more than 1,330 local, direct, in-market sales professionals with long standing relationships with small businesses in the communities we serve.

Our core products include:

• | 142 daily newspapers with total paid circulation of approximately 1.5 million;


• | 326 weekly newspapers (published up to three times per week) with total paid circulation of approximately 318,000 and total free circulation of approximately 2.0 million;


• | 140 “shoppers” (generally advertising-only publications) with total circulation of approximately 3.5 million;


• | 569 locally-focused websites, which extend our businesses onto the internet and mobile devices with approximately 290 million page views per month;


• | two yellow page directories, with a distribution of approximately 290,000, that cover a population of approximately 419,000 people;


• | 70 business publications; and


• | UpCurve Cloud and ThriveHive digital marketing.

In addition to our core products, we also opportunistically produce niche publications that address specific local market interests such as recreation, sports, healthcare and real estate.
GateHouse Live, our event business, was started in late 2015 to leverage our local brands to create world-class events in the markets we serve.  GateHouse Live now produces over 250 annual events with a collective attendance over 300,000.  Among our core event offerings are a variety of themed expos focused on target audiences, including men, women, seniors and young families.  Other signature event series produced across many of our markets include one of the nation's largest high school sports recognition events and the official community's choice awards for dozens of markets across the country.  GateHouse Live also offers white label event services for retailers and other media companies.
Our print and online products focus on the local community from a content, advertising, and digital marketing perspective. As a result of our focus on small and midsize markets, we are usually the primary, and sometimes, the sole provider of comprehensive local market news and information in the communities we serve. Our content is primarily devoted to topics that we believe are highly relevant and of interest to our audience such as local news and politics, community and regional events, youth sports, opinion and editorial pages, local schools, obituaries, weddings and police reports. 
More than 85% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years and 99% have been published for more than 50 years. We believe that the longevity of our publications demonstrates the value and relevance of the local information that we provide and has created a strong foundation of reader loyalty and a highly-recognized media brand name in each community we serve. As a result of these factors, we believe that our publications have high local audience penetration rates in our markets, thereby providing advertisers with strong local market reach.
We believe the large number of publications we have, our focus on smaller markets, and our geographic diversity also provide the following benefits to our strategy:

• | Diversified revenue streams, both in terms of customers and markets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from clustering of business assets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from centralization of back office functions;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from improved buying power for key operating cost items through our increased size and scale;


• | Ability to provide consistent management practices and ensure best practices; and


• | Less competition and high barriers to entry.

The revenues derived from our SMB category come from a variety of print and digital marketing and business service products we offer through UpCurve, and commercial printing services. Our consumer revenue category comes primarily from subscription income as consumers pay for our deep, rich local content, both in print and online, however primarily print today.
Our operating costs consist primarily of labor, newsprint, and delivery costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor costs. Compensation represents just under 50% of our expenses. Over the last few years, we have worked to drive efficiencies and centralization of work throughout our Company. Additionally, we have taken steps to cluster our operations, thereby increasing the usage of facilities and equipment while increasing the productivity of our labor force. We expect to continue to employ these steps as part of our business strategy.

New Media was formed as a Delaware corporation on June 18, 2013. New Media had no operations until November 26, 2013, when it assumed control of GateHouse Media, Inc. ("GateHouse" or "Predecessor") and Local Media Group Holdings LLC. GateHouse was determined to be the predecessor to New Media, as the operations of GateHouse comprised substantially all of the business operations of the combined companies. Pursuant to a restructuring, Newcastle Investment Corp. (“Newcastle”) owned approximately 84.6% of New Media until February 13, 2014, upon which date Newcastle distributed the shares that it held in New Media to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. New Media is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”).
Management Agreement
On November 26, 2013, New Media entered into a management agreement (the "Management Agreement") with FIG LLC (the "Manager") pursuant to which the Manager manages the operations of New Media. The annual management fee is 1.50% of New Media’s Total Equity (as defined in the Management Agreement), and the Manager is eligible to receive incentive compensation. On December 27, 2017, SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) announced that it completed its previously announced acquisition of Fortress (the “SoftBank Merger”). Following the SoftBank Merger, Fortress will operate within SoftBank as an independent business headquartered in New York. Fortress’s senior investment professionals are expected to remain in place, including those individuals who perform services for us.
Acquisitions
On January 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Halifax Media Group for an aggregate purchase price of $285.4 million, including working capital and net of assumed debt. The acquisition included 24 daily publications, thirteen weekly publications, and five shoppers serving areas of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and South Carolina with a daily circulation of approximately 635,000 and 752,000 on Sunday.
On March 18, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Stephens Media, LLC (“Stephens Media”) for an aggregate purchase price of $110.8 million, including working capital. The acquisition included nine daily newspapers, 35 weekly publications and fifteen shoppers serving communities throughout the United States with a combined average daily circulation of approximately 221,000 and 244,000 on Sunday.
On June 15, 2015 and September 23, 2015, we acquired substantially all the assets, properties and business of publishing/operating certain newspapers for an aggregate purchase price of $52.0 million, including working capital. The acquisitions included two daily newspapers, 28 weekly publications, and two shoppers serving Central Ohio and Southern Michigan.
During 2016, we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of certain businesses, which included 68 business publications, seven daily newspapers, seven weekly publications, eleven shoppers, and digital platforms for an aggregate purchase price of $135.9 million, including working capital. 
During 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets, properties, and business of certain publications/businesses, which included four business publications, 22 daily newspapers, 34 weekly publications, 24 shoppers, two customer relationship management solutions providers, a social media app and an event production business for an aggregate purchase price of $165.1 million, including estimated working capital.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment
As part of the ongoing cost reduction programs, the Company is consolidating print facilities, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company ceased printing operations at 15 facilities.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge related to retired equipment of $7.1 million and accelerated depreciation of $2.4 million over the revised useful life of the equipment during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Dispositions
On December 10, 2015, we completed the sale of the Las Vegas Review-Journal and related publications (initially acquired in the Stephens Media acquisition), which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada for an aggregate sale price of $140.0 million plus working capital adjustment of $1.0 million. As a result, a gain of $57.0 million is included in loss (gain) on sale or disposal of assets on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 27, 2015.
On June 2, 2017, we completed the sale of the Mail Tribune, located in Medford, Oregon, for approximately $14.7 million, including working capital.  As a result, a pre-tax gain of approximately $5.4 million, net of selling expenses, is 
3

included in (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Subsequent Events
Dividends
On February 28, 2018, we announced a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Media ("New Media Common Stock" or our "Common Stock"). The dividend will be paid on March 22, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2018.
Debt
On February 16, 2018, the New Media Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide for (i) additional dollar-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million on the same terms as the outstanding term loans that will mature on July 14, 2022 (the new and outstanding term loans, together, the “Term Loans”) and (ii) a 1.00% prepayment premium for any prepayments of the Term Loans made in connection with certain repricing transactions effected within six months of the date of the amendment.
Industry Overview
We operate in what is sometimes referred to as the “hyper-local” or community news market within the media industry. Media companies that serve this segment provide highly-focused local content and advertising that is generally unique to each market they serve and is not readily obtainable from other sources. Local publications include community newspapers, websites, shoppers, traders, real estate guides, special interest magazines and directories. Due to the unique local nature of their content and audience, community publications compete for advertising customers with other forms of traditional media, including direct mail, directories, radio, television, and outdoor advertising. They also compete with new local and national digital and social media businesses for advertising and digital and business services customers. We believe that local print and online publications in smaller markets are the most effective medium for local retail advertising, which emphasizes the price of goods in an effort to move inventory on a regular basis, in contrast to radio, broadcast and cable, television, and the internet, which are generally used for image or branding advertising. In addition, we believe local print and online publications generally have the highest local audience penetration rates, which allows local advertisers to get their message to a large portion of the local audience. Finally, national digital competitors tend to have no local in-market sales presence which we believe gives the local community publications an advantage when selling these types of products and services.
Locally-focused media in small and midsize communities is distinct from national and urban media delivered through outlets such as television, radio, metropolitan and national newspapers and the internet. Larger media outlets tend to offer broad based information to a geographically-scattered audience, which tends to be more of a commodity. In contrast, locally-focused media delivers a highly-focused product that is often the only source of local news and information in the market it serves. Our segment of the media industry is also characterized by high barriers to entry, both economic and social. Small and midsize communities can generally only sustain one newspaper. Moreover, the brand value associated with long-term reader and advertiser loyalty and the high start-up costs associated with developing and distributing content and selling advertisements, help to limit competition.
We also believe there is a growing need among small to mid-size businesses to be able to generate leads and interact with consumers across all the digital platforms, which takes many forms including websites, mobile sites, tablets and social media. These local business owners and managers lack the time, expertise and resources to capitalize on the potential of these consumer-reaching channels. National competitors in this category do not generally have a local in-market presence. Newly-formed competitors lack a known and credible brand name in addition to generally not having a local in-market presence. We believe this represents a substantial opportunity for our local media business.
Advertising Market
The primary sources of advertising revenue for local publications are small businesses, corporations, government agencies and individuals that reside in the market that a publication serves. By combining paid circulation publications with total market coverage (“TMC”) publications, such as shoppers and other specialty publications (tailored to the specific attributes of a local community), local publications are able to reach nearly 100% of the households in a distribution area. As macroeconomic conditions in advertising change, due to increasing internet and mobile usage and the wide array of available information sources, we have seen advertisers shift their focus to incorporate a digital advertising and services component into their overall local marketing strategy. To that end, in addition to printed products, the majority of our local publications have an online presence that further leverages the local brand, ensures higher penetration into the market, and provides a digital 
4

alternative for local advertisers to reach consumers. We also have strong digital marketing and business services offered through ThriveHive and UpCurve Cloud.
Digital Media
The time spent online and on mobile devices each day by media consumers continues to grow and newspaper websites offer a wide variety of content providing comprehensive, in-depth and up-to-the-minute coverage of news and current events. The ability to generate, publish and archive more news and information than most other sources has allowed newspapers to produce some of the most visited sites on the internet. 
We believe that our local publications are well positioned to capitalize on their existing market presence and grow their total audience base by publishing proprietary local content digitally: via the internet and mobile applications. Local digital media include traditional classifieds, directories of business information, local advertising, databases, audience-contributed content and mobile applications. We believe this additional community-specific content will further extend and expand both the reach and the brand of our publications with readers and advertisers. We believe that building a strong local digital business extends the core audience of a local publication.
The opportunity created by the digital extension of the core audience makes local digital advertising an attractive complement for existing print advertisers, while opening up opportunities to attract new local advertisers that have not previously advertised with local publications. In addition, we believe that national advertisers have an interest in reaching buyers on a hyper-local level and, although they historically have not been significant advertisers in community publications, we believe that digital media offers them a powerful medium to reach local audiences. This opportunity is further enhanced by our behavioral-targeting products, which allow advertisers to reach specific demographics of our audience and follow that audience across multiple websites, delivering advertisements across the platforms. Further, digital marketing services businesses are poised to benefit from the rise in internet marketing spend, which grew 22% between 2015 and 2016, and 330% between 2006 and 2016, according to the 2016 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report issued in April 2017.
We believe that a strong digital business will enhance our revenues. In addition, we believe that we have the expertise and sales resources to help other businesses maximize their digital opportunities. UpCurve provides two broad categories of services: ThiveHive which is designed to help SMBs utilize the digital space to generate leads, interact with consumers and grow their businesses, and UpCurve Cloud which offers best-in-breed cloud-based products with expert migration, integration, and support. UpCurve’s digital and business services revenue derived from advertising, circulation, and other revenue has grown since the launch of ThriveHive in 2012. New Media’s digital and business services revenue was $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 15.7% growth as compared with the same period in 2016, which had digital and business services revenue of $123.9 million. Of this, $71.3 million, or 49.7% of digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to UpCurve. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We have invested in UpCurve, but such investments may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
We anticipate that the digital marketing and business services sector will continue to grow as SMBs move from print to digital marketing in connection with consumers spending more time online. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in 2014 there were approximately 29.6 million SMBs in the US; 29.0 million of the SMBs had 20 employees or less, and SMBs are expected to spend $53.4 billion on digital marketing in 2018 (according to the U.S. Local Advertising Forecast 2018 by BIA/Kelsey). Owners of SMBs often lack the resources and expertise to navigate the digital marketing and business services sector. According to Clutch’s 2017 Small Business Survey, 29% of SMBs do not have a website, and 17% of SMBs with websites do not have mobile compatibility. ThriveHive offers SMBs digital and business services, including website design, search engine optimization, mobile apps, social media, retargeting and other advertising services. We believe that ThriveHive is well positioned to assist SMBs in the digital space and expect ThriveHive to contribute meaningfully to future revenue growth. UpCurve and ThriveHive are also able to leverage our local media properties and local sales infrastructure to give us distinct advantages, including:

• | our strong and trusted local brands, with 85% of our daily newspapers having published local content for more than 100 years;


• | our ability to market through our print and online properties, driving branding and traffic; and


• | our more than 1,330 local, direct, in-market sales professionals with long standing relationships with small businesses in the communities we serve.

Circulation
Overall daily newspaper print circulation, including national and urban newspapers, has been declining over the past several years. Small and midsize local market newspapers have generally had smaller declines and more stability in their paid 
5

print circulation volumes due to the relevant and unique hyper-local news they produce combined with less competition than larger markets. In addition, we believe this unique and valuable hyper-local content along with the multiple delivery platforms that are now available will allow smaller market newspapers to continue to raise prices, leading to stable circulation revenues. Data and technology now available to newspaper companies allow them to target pricing more at the household level rather than purely by market. This will lead to more effective pricing strategies and enhance stability for circulation revenues. 
Our Strengths
High Quality Assets with Leading Local Businesses. Our publications benefit from a long history in the communities we serve as one of the leading, and often sole, providers of comprehensive local content. More than 85% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years, and 99% have been published for more than 50 years. This has resulted in brand recognition for our publications, reader loyalty and high local audience penetration rates, which are highly valued by local advertisers. We continue to build on long-standing relationships with local advertisers and our in-depth knowledge of the consumers in our local markets. We believe our local news content is unique and highly valued by consumers who live in our markets, and there are limited, and in some cases no competing sources of local content for our target customers.
Large Locally Focused Sales Force. We have large and well known “in-market” local sales forces in the markets we serve, consisting of over 1,330 sales representatives, including 45 dedicated to UpCurve and seven third-party sales affiliations. Our sales forces are generally among the largest locally-oriented media sales forces in their respective communities. We have long-standing relationships with many local businesses and have the ability to be face to face with most local businesses due to these unique characteristics we enjoy. We believe our strong brands combined with our “in-market” presence give us a distinct advantage in selling and growing in the digital services sector given the complex nature of these products. We also believe that these qualities provide leverage for our sales force to grow additional future revenue streams in our markets, particularly in the digital sector.
Ability to Acquire and Integrate New Assets. We have created a national platform for consolidating local media businesses and have demonstrated an ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate local media asset acquisitions. Together with our predecessor, we have acquired over $2.5 billion of assets since 2006, including traditional newspaper, business publication, business services and directory businesses. We have a scalable infrastructure and platform to leverage for future acquisitions.
Scale Yields Operating Profit Margins and Allows Us to Realize Operating Synergies. We believe we can generate higher operating profit margins than our publications could achieve on a stand-alone basis by leveraging our operations and implementing revenue initiatives, especially digital and business services initiatives, across a broader local footprint in a geographic cluster and by centralizing certain back-office production, accounting, administrative and corporate operations. We also benefit from economies of scale in the purchase of insurance, newsprint and other large strategic supplies and equipment. Finally, we have the ability to further leverage our centralized services and buying power to reduce operating costs when making future strategic accretive acquisitions.
Local Business Profile Generates Significant Cash Flow. Our local business profile allows us to generate significant recurring cash flow due to our diversified revenue base and high operating profit margins and maintaining our low capital expenditure and working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2017, our debt structure consists of the New Media Credit Agreement and Advantage Credit Agreements (as defined below). We believe that we have the ability to generate significant free cash flow that has the potential to lead to stockholder value creation through our investments in organic growth, investments in accretive acquisitions and the return of cash to stockholders in the form of dividends, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. We further believe the strong cash flows generated and available to be invested will lead to consistent future dividend growth.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is made up of executives who have an average of over 25 years of experience in the media industry, including strong traditional and digital media expertise. Our management team has broad industry experience with regard to both growing new digital and business services lines and identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions. Our management team also has key strengths in managing geographically dispersed teams, including the sales force, and identifying and centralizing duplicate functions across businesses leading to reduced core infrastructure costs.
Our Strategy
We intend to create stockholder value through a variety of factors including organic growth driven by our consumer and SMB strategies, pursuing attractive strategic acquisitions of high-quality local media assets, and through the distribution of a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations and other sources as a dividend, subject to satisfactory financial 
6

performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to accomplish any of these strategic initiatives.
A key component of our strategy is to acquire and operate traditional local media businesses and transform them from print-centric operations to dynamic multi-media operations through our existing online advertising, digital marketing and business services. We will also leverage our existing platform to operate these businesses more efficiently. We believe all of these initiatives will lead to revenue and cash flow growth for New Media. We intend to distribute a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations and other sources as a dividend to stockholders, through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s GAAP net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. The key elements of our strategy include:
Maintain Our Leading Position in the Delivery of Proprietary Local Content in Our Communities. We seek to maintain our position as a leading provider of unique local content in the markets we serve and to leverage this position to strengthen our relationships with both readers and local businesses, thereby increasing penetration rates and market share. A critical aspect of this approach is to continue to provide local content that is not readily obtainable elsewhere and to be able to deliver that content to our customers across multiple print and digital platforms.
Grow Our Digital Marketing and Business Services. We plan to continue to scale and expand our digital marketing and business services platform, UpCurve. We believe UpCurve will allow us to sell digital marketing and business services to SMBs both in and outside of existing New Media markets. The SMB demand for digital and business service solutions is great and represents a rapidly expanding opportunity. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in 2014 there were approximately 29.6 million SMBs in the U.S. and, according to a U.S. Local Advertising Forecast 2018 by BIA/Kelsey, digital revenues are expected to grow to $53.4 billion in 2018. Owners of SMBs often lack the resources and expertise to navigate the digital marketing services sector, with 29% of SMBs not having a website, and 17% of SMBs with websites do not have a mobile-friendly website according to Clutch’s 2017 Small Business Survey. We believe local SMBs will turn to our trusted local media brands to help them navigate through developing their digital marketing presence and business strategy. We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure gives us a distinct advantage to being the leading local provider of digital marketing and business services.
Pursue Strategic Accretive Acquisitions. We intend to capitalize on the highly fragmented and distressed local print industries which have greatly reduced valuation levels. We continue to expect to focus our investments primarily in the local newspaper sector in small to mid-size markets. We believe we have a strong operational platform as well as scalable digital marketing and business services. This platform, along with our deep industry specific knowledge and our experienced management team, can be leveraged to reduce costs, stabilize the core business and grow digital revenues at acquired properties. The size and fragmentation of the addressable print media market place in the United States, the greatly reduced valuation levels that exist in these industries, and our deep experience make this an attractive place for our initial consolidation focus and capital allocation. Over the longer term we also believe there may be opportunity to diversify and acquire these types of assets internationally, as well as other traditional local media assets such as broadcast TV, out of home advertising (billboards) and radio, in the United States and internationally. We also believe there may be opportunities to acquire other strong businesses that have strong local brands and local sales infrastructure or digital product companies, both of which could quickly scale our digital marketing and business services platform.
Stabilize Our Core Business Operations. We have four primary drivers in our strategic plans to stabilize our core business operations, including: (i) identifying permanent structural expense reductions in our traditional business cost infrastructure and re-deploying a portion of those costs toward future growth opportunities, primarily on the digital side of our business; (ii) accelerating the growth of both our digital audiences and revenues through improvements to current products, new product development, training, opportunistic changes in hiring to create an employee base with a more diversified skill set and sharing of best practices; (iii) accelerating our consumer revenue growth through subscription pricing increases, pay meters for digital content and growth in our overall subscriber base; and (iv) stabilizing our core print advertising revenues through improvements to pricing, packaging of products for customers that will produce the best results for them, and more technology and training for sales management and sales representatives.
New Media intends to focus its business strategy on building its digital marketing and business services and growing its online advertising business. With its improved capital structure and digital focus, combined with its strengths and strategy and dividend strategy, we believe that New Media will be able to grow stockholder value. However, there can be no assurance of this. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Challenges
As a publisher of locally-based print and online media, we face a number of challenges, including the risks that:

• | the growing shift within the publishing industry from traditional print media to digital forms of publication may compromise our ability to generate sufficient advertising revenues;


• | investments in growing our digital and business services may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations;


• | our advertising and circulation revenues may decline if we are unable to compete effectively with other companies in the local media industry; and


• | we may not be able to successfully acquire local print media assets at attractive valuations due to a rise in valuations from a more competitive landscape of acquirers.

For more information about New Media’s risks and challenges, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

17

Business Group.  We are one of the leading owners of business journals in the U.S., producing several daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly publications, as well as data products, webinars and live events. Anchored by an experienced team of award-winning journalists, the business brands provide relevant, actionable news and analysis for the business, construction, retail and real estate communities in more than 11 markets across the nation. In addition to digital and print advertising, the Business Group earns a sizable portion of revenue from paid subscription products, live events and thought leadership programs.
Regionally, the Business Group spans the entire country, reaching as far west as Portland, OR; New Orleans, La., in the South; and Long Island, NY, in the Northeast. Specifically, this group includes the following publications: The Journal Record (Oklahoma City, OK); City Business (New Orleans, LA); Daily Journal of Commerce (New Orleans, LA); Idaho Business Review (Boise, ID); Long Island Business News (Ronkonkoma, NY); The Daily Reporter (Milwaukee, WI); NJBiz (Somerset, NJ); Pet Age (Somerset, NJ); Finance & Commerce (Minneapolis, MN); Lehigh Valley Business (Allentown, PA); Central Penn Business Journal (Harrisburg, PA); Central Penn Parent (Harrisburg, PA), Rochester Business Journal (Rochester, NY); and Daily Journal of Commerce (Portland, OR); Charleston Regional Business Journal (Charleston, SC); Columbia Regional Business Report (Columbia, SC); and GSA Business Report (Greenville, SC).
Legal Group. We are one of the leading operators of regionally-focused legal publications in the U.S., producing several daily, weekly and monthly publications, as well as data products, webinars and live events. Guided by a veteran team of award-winning journalists and attorneys, the Legal Group provides relevant, actionable news, analysis and legal opinions for lawyers, judges and legislators. In addition to paid subscriptions, digital and print advertising, the Legal Group earns a sizable portion of revenue from events, webinars and legislative alert services.
Regionally, the Legal Group stretches across the U.S. Specifically, this group includes the following publications: Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly (Boston, MA); Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly; Wisconsin Law Journal (Milwaukee, WI); Missouri Lawyers Weekly (St. Louis, MO); North Carolina Lawyers Weekly (Charlotte, NC): South Carolina Lawyers Weekly; Minnesota Lawyer (Minneapolis, MN); Michigan Lawyers Weekly (Detroit, MI); Virginia Lawyers Weekly (Richmond, VA); Arizona Capitol Times (Phoenix, AZ) and The Daily Record (Baltimore, MD).

Directories
The core of our directory portfolio is Surewest Directories located in and around the Sacramento, California area, primarily in Roseville, California. The directory has a circulation of approximately 270,000 and services areas of Placer and Sacramento counties. The Roseville directory has served the local Roseville community for over 100 years and has achieved more than 50% market share.
We also own one additional directory based in Mt. Shasta, California.
UpCurve
UpCurve is our business services product line with digital products designed for SMBs. UpCurve provides two broad categories of services: ThriveHive which provides marketing services for every SMB regardless of size, and UpCurve Cloud which offers best-in-breed cloud-based products with expert migration, integration, and support. We believe the digital services industry represents a large and expanding opportunity. UpCurve is a product offering we created to attack that opportunity.
There were approximately 29.6 million SMBs in the U.S. in 2014 and about 29.0 million had 20 employees or less according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Although these businesses are increasingly beginning to recognize the need to establish and maintain a strategy for the digital space, most do not have the time, expertise or resources to handle this themselves.
UpCurve is a product line that can become the outsourced digital marketing services department for those SMBs. ThriveHive’s products help SMBs build a presence across digital platforms, help them get found by consumers, help them 
18

engage with and grow their customer base. We pull these products together for the SMB with a proprietary customer dashboard which integrates activity and results for all ThriveHive products.
We also believe UpCurve gives us an opportunity to expand beyond our current geographic boundaries, as its product set is of value to SMBs around the country.
Revenue
Our operations generate three primary types of revenue: (i) advertising, (ii) circulation (including home delivery subscriptions, single copy sales and digital subscriptions) and (iii) other (primarily commercial printing, alternate delivery, digital marketing and business services and events). In 2017, these revenue streams accounted for approximately 51%, 35% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue. The contribution of advertising, circulation and other revenue to our total revenue for New Media for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015 was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, 2017 | | Year Ended December 25, 2016 | | Year Ended December 27, 2015
(in thousands) | | | | | 
Revenue: | | | | | 
Advertising | $ | 683,990 | | | $ | 684,900 | | $ | 696,696 
Circulation | 474,324 | | | 421,497 | | | 378,263
Commercial printing and other | 183,690 | | | 148,959 | | | 120,856
Total revenue | $ | 1,342,004 | | | $ | 1,255,356 | | $ | 1,195,815

Advertising
Advertising revenue, which includes revenue generated from online and mobile products, is the largest component of our revenue, accounting for approximately 51%, 55% and 58% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We categorize advertising as follows:

• | Local Retail—local retailers, local stores for national retailers, grocers, drug stores, department and furniture stores, local financial institutions, niche shops, restaurants and other consumer related businesses.


• | Local Classified—local legal, obituaries, employment, automotive, real estate and other advertising.


• | Online—banner, display, classified, behavioral targeting, audience extension, search and other advertising on websites or mobile devices.


• | National—national and major accounts such as wireless communications companies, airlines and hotels, generally placed with us through agencies.

We believe that our advertising revenue tends to be less volatile than the advertising revenue of large metropolitan and national print media because we rely primarily on local, rather than national advertising and our classified revenue tends to be more local market oriented (job listing, for example). We generally derive 95% or more of our advertising revenue from local advertising (local retail, local classified and online) and less than 5% from national advertising. We believe that local advertising tends to be less sensitive to economic cycles than national advertising because local businesses generally have fewer effective advertising channels through which they may reach their customers.
Our advertising rate structures vary among our publications and are a function of various factors, including local market conditions, competition, circulation, readership and demographics. Management works with local newspaper management to set advertising rates and a portion of our publishers’ incentive compensation is based upon growing advertising revenue. Our sales compensation program emphasizes digital and new business growth. We share advertising concepts throughout our network of publishers and advertising directors, including periodic special section programs, enabling them to utilize advertising products and sales strategies that are successful in other markets we serve.
Substantially all of our advertising revenue is derived from a diverse group of local retailers and local classified advertisers, resulting in very limited customer concentration. No single advertiser accounted for more than 1% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015 and our 20 largest advertisers account for less than 10% of total revenue.
Our advertising revenue tends to follow a seasonal pattern, with higher advertising revenue in months containing significant events or holidays. Accordingly, our first quarter, followed by our third quarter, historically, are our weakest quarters 
19

of the year in terms of revenue. Correspondingly, our second and fourth fiscal quarters, historically, are our strongest quarters. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our advertising revenue in future periods.
We have experienced declines in advertising revenue over the past few years, due primarily to the secular pressures on the business as consumers and advertisers shift time and spend from traditional media to the internet. We continue to search for organic growth opportunities, specifically with digital advertising and ways to stabilize print revenue declines through strengthening local news product, value based pricing and training of sales staff.
Circulation
Our circulation revenue is derived from home delivery sales to subscribers, single copy sales at retail stores and vending racks and boxes, and digital subscriptions. We own 142 paid daily publications that range in circulation from approximately 700 to 99,000 and 202 paid weekly publications that range in circulation from approximately 100 to 16,000. Circulation revenue accounted for approximately 35%, 33% and 32% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015, respectively.
Subscriptions are typically sold for three to twelve-month terms and often include promotions to extend the average subscription period or convert someone to become a subscriber. We also provide bundled print and digital subscriptions and employ pay meters for our website content at most of our daily publications. We implement marketing programs to increase readership through subscription and single copy sales, including company-wide and local circulation contests, direct mail programs, door-to-door sales and strategic alliances with local schools in the form of “Newspapers in Education” programs. In addition, since the adoption of the Telemarketing Sales Rule by the Federal Trade Commission in 2003, which created a national “do not call” registry, we have increased our use of “EZ Pay” programs, kiosks, sampling programs, in-paper promotions and online promotions to increase our circulation.
We encourage subscriber use of EZ Pay, a monthly credit card charge or direct bank debit payment program, which has led to higher retention rates for subscribers. We also use an active stop-loss program for all expiring subscribers. Additionally, in order to improve our circulation revenue and circulation trends, we periodically review the need for quality enhancements, such as:

• | Consumer research to better understand local content of interest;


• | Increasing the amount of unique hyper-local content;


• | Increasing the use of color and color photographs;


• | Improving graphic design, including complete redesigns;


• | Developing creative and interactive promotional campaigns;


• | Improving customer service and company-wide customer retention efforts; and


• | Better use of demographic data to specifically target pricing and customer acquisition opportunities.

We believe that our unique and valuable hyper-local content allows us to continue to produce products of great relevance to our local market audiences. This allows us to be able to periodically raise prices, both for home delivery and on a single copy basis, resulting in increased circulation revenues. We also believe this unique hyper-local content will allow us to find ways to grow circulation revenues from our wide array of digital products.
Other
We provide commercial printing services to third parties on a competitive bid basis as a means to generate incremental revenue and utilize excess printing capacity. These customers consist primarily of other publishers that do not have their own printing presses and do not compete with our publications. We also print other commercial materials, including flyers, business cards and invitations. Additionally, this category includes UpCurve which provides digital marketing and business services for SMBs and GateHouse Live, our events business. Other sources of revenue, including commercial printing and UpCurve, accounted for approximately 14%, 12% and 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015, respectively.
Printing and Distribution
We own and operate 54 print facilities. Our print facilities produce nine publications on average and are generally located within 60 miles of the communities served. By clustering our production resources or outsourcing where cost beneficial, we are able to reduce the operating costs of our publications while increasing the quality of our small and midsize market publications that would typically not otherwise have access to high quality production facilities. We also believe that we are able to reduce future capital expenditure needs by having fewer overall pressrooms and buildings. We believe our superior production quality is critical to maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading provider of local news coverage in the markets we serve. As 
20

other print media businesses look to reduce costs, we believe we have the opportunity to leverage our unutilized press time to grow our commercial print customer base and revenue.
The distribution of our daily newspapers is typically outsourced to independent, locally based, third-party distributors that also distribute a majority of our weekly newspapers and non-newspaper publications. We continuously evaluate lower cost options for newspaper delivery. In addition, certain of our shopper and weekly publications are delivered via the U.S. Postal Service.
Availability of Raw Materials for Our Business—Newsprint
The basic raw material for our publications is newsprint. We generally maintain only a 45 to 55-day inventory of newsprint.
Historically, the market price of newsprint has been volatile, reaching a high of approximately $823 per metric ton in 2008 and a low of $410 per metric ton in 2002. However, from 2010 to 2017, there was much less volatility in newsprint pricing, and we have benefited from negotiating a fixed annual price for a majority of our newsprint. The average market price of newsprint during 2017 was approximately $635 per metric ton.
In 2016, we consumed approximately 109,700 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing), and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $62.0 million. In contrast, in 2017, we consumed approximately 115,900 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing), and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $66.3 million. Our newsprint expense typically averages less than 10% of total revenue, which we believe generally compares favorably to larger, metropolitan newspapers.
For our 2016 and 2017 purchases of newsprint, we negotiated a fixed price for approximately 90% and 88%, respectively, of our newsprint tons which allowed us to eliminate some of the volatility of the market price. 
Competition
Each of our publications competes for advertising revenue to varying degrees with traditional media outlets such as direct mail, yellow pages, radio, outdoor advertising, broadcast and cable television, magazines, local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers and other print and online media sources, including local blogs. We also increasingly compete with new digital and social media companies for advertising revenue. However, we believe that barriers to entry remain high in many of the markets we serve in terms of being the preeminent source for local news and information therein, because our markets are generally not large enough to support a second newspaper and because our local news gathering infrastructures, sales networks and relationships would be time consuming and costly to replicate. We also have highly-recognized local brand names and long histories in the towns we serve.
We also provide our readers with community-specific content, which is generally not available from other media sources. We believe that our direct and focused coverage of the market and our cost effective advertising rates relative to more broadly circulated metropolitan newspapers allow us to tailor an approach for our advertisers. As a result, our publications generally capture a large share of local advertising in the markets they serve.
The level of competition and the primary competitors we face vary from market to market. Competition tends to be based on market penetration, demographic and quality factors, as opposed to price factors. The competitive environment in each of our operating regions is discussed in greater detail below.
Eastern US Publishing. In Eastern US Publishing, the Boston Globe and boston.com, a metropolitan daily and website, respectively, owned by John Henry, compete with the publications throughout eastern Massachusetts. In addition, competition from other Massachusetts companies include approximately 16 dailies and 50 weeklies, three major radio station operators, five local network television broadcasters, one cable company and numerous niche publications for advertising revenues. 
The Cape Cod and New Bedford, Massachusetts newspapers experience competition from weekly newspapers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications.
In Middletown, New York, The Times Herald-Record is the leading print and digital media and has an audience far larger than its competitors, including Daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (Poughkeepsie Journal in Poughkeepsie, New York) and 21st Century Media, Inc. (Daily Freeman in Kingston, New York) compete within the New York market. The Times Herald-Record also competes with 46 weekly, bi-weekly and monthly print products and Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable), radio stations and directories. The market is formally known as the Hudson Valley New York region. 
21

The Company's publication, the Providence Journal, is the leading daily newspaper in the state of Rhode Island followed by the Newport Daily News, which is also owned by us. Other daily newspaper operators in the state include Sun Publishing Company, owner of the Westerly Sun and three non-dailies in the state. RISN Operations, Inc. publishes four daily papers and five weekly publications serving communities in Providence county and Rhode Island. Three other companies publish more than 16 weeklies in Rhode Island. The Providence market has seven local network television stations and three major radio station operators, one cable company and numerous print and online niche publications, such as Rhode Island Monthly Magazine and the business publication, Providence Business News.
The Fayetteville Observer delivers to 10 counties in southeastern North Carolina. It is based in Cumberland County, home to Fayetteville and Fort Bragg, the nation’s largest Army installation. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox affiliates based in Raleigh, Durham and Wilmington cover the Fayetteville region, with at least two stations having small bureaus in Fayetteville. Beasley Broadcast Group and Cumulus Media Inc. dominate the radio market with stations including WFCN 640 AM news talk, WZFX 99.1 FM Foxy 99 urban contemporary, WKML 95.7 FM country, WQSM 98.1 FM hot adult contemporary, and WRCQ 103.5 FM rock. Mspark is the primary direct mail competitor. Lamar Advertising and Fairway Outdoor serve the billboard needs of the market. Niche print publications based in Fayetteville include Up & Coming Weekly, CityView Magazine and The Fayetteville Press. The Fayetteville Observer is by far the leading print and digital publication in the region. 
The Company's publications, The Gainesville Sun and Ocala Star Banner, are the leading media in their respective markets, primarily Alachua and Marion counties. We compete with four television stations, which is unusual for markets this size. Gainesville has its own DMA and Ocala falls into the Orlando DMA. There are no other dailies in the market other than a slow movement by the Villages Daily Sun into Marion county (Ocala), a concern due to their offering the lowest home delivery and single copy rates of any Florida daily. They operate as part of one of the fastest growing developments in the county, The Villages. The Gainesville Sun also publishes a weekly newspaper, Gainesville Guardian, in east Gainesville and also a very successful city magazine, Gainesville Magazine.
In the Daytona Beach market, The Daytona Beach News-Journal is the leading media. Primary print competition for the west side of the coverage area is the Orlando Sentinel, owned by tronc, Inc. Smaller weekly competitive publications, including The Observer Group and Hometown News, are also in the market. Major radio and network television stations are out of the Orlando market.
In the Sarasota market, The Herald-Tribune publications are generally the leading media and have an audience far larger than the competitors for the main areas we serve. Daily newspapers owned by McClatchy (Bradenton Herald) and Sun Coast Media Group, the Charlotte Sun, border on the north and south ends of the market, respectively, and distribute in some circulation areas on the fringes. The Herald-Tribune prints the Bradenton Herald and is contracted to distribute all home delivery copies. The Sarasota market has one local network television station and several local radio station operators and cable companies as well as numerous non-daily print and online niche publications.
Located in central Florida, the publication, The Ledger, in Lakeland is bordered by the Orlando Sentinel to the east and the Tampa Bay Times to the west. In addition, competitors include multiple weekly newspapers and two radio stations. The Ledger is the leading media in the central Florida area it serves. The Lakeland Ledger started printing the Orlando Sentinel in September 2017.
In Tuscaloosa and Gadsden, the Tuscaloosa News and Gadsden Times, respectively, are the leading media in the markets they serve. Television that serves both markets is out of Birmingham, Alabama. The digital space is highly competitive with the competing site AL.com, owned by Advance Local, covering the state.
Central US Publishing. Central US Publishing operates in 115 markets and we believe our publications are the leading print advertising media in the vast majority of these markets. There are radio stations in or within 20 miles of every market in which we operate, but we do not believe that any of these radio station operators pose a significant competitive threat to our publications. Yellow page advertising is prevalent in all of our markets with either a local phone book or a regional phone book. We believe that, in most cases, yellow page advertising is geared more towards the professional services advertisers, such as attorneys and doctors, and not the local retail advertisers, as is the focus with our non-directory publications.
In the Columbus market, the advertising competition in print is minimal with just a weekly business journal and a few small monthly magazines. On the electronic and digital side, the competition is intense and is comprised of six network TV stations, three cable companies, ten radio stations, and twelve digital agencies, with SMART 1 being the most aligned with our UpCurve product set.
Lee Enterprises publishes the Southern Illinoisan in Carbondale, which is a regional newspaper that competes with our publication in West Frankfort. We believe our publication is the leading local daily, but we do compete on a regional basis with the larger dailies. We also compete with shoppers or weekly newspapers. This competition comes from small independent 
22

operators and is not significant. We have very little television competition in this group because of our geographic location in relation to major markets. There are no local television affiliates in our markets.
In the Northeast market of this group, we believe our publications are generally the leading media. The competition we face in this region is from major newspaper companies: daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (The Star-Gazette in Elmira, NY and the Chambersburg (PA) Public-Opinion); Times-Shamrock Company’s Scranton (PA) The Times-Tribune and Towanda Daily/Sunday Review; Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.’s Sunbury Daily Item; and Ogden-Nutting’s Williamsport Sun-Gazette. We believe our publications tend to be the leading local publications in those markets.
In our Great Lakes markets, we believe our publications are generally the leading media in those markets. Our only significant competition comes from regional television stations in Adrian, Michigan. We also face competition from dozens of other competitors such as other local daily and weekly papers and niche publications, as well as radio and television stations, directories, direct mail and non-local internet websites, but none of these have proven to be significant.
Western US Publishing. In the southern regions of this group, we believe our publications are generally the leading media. Our major competition comes from regional daily newspapers, specifically: The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; The American Press in Lake Charles, Louisiana; The Joplin Globe; and the Wichita Eagle. We also face competition from numerous other daily and weekly papers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications. That being said, our community newspapers operate generally in isolated markets where the newspapers are by far the leading sources of local news and print advertising. In the Sherman, Texas market, we believe our publications are generally the leading media in those markets with minor competition with The Dallas Morning News, which has minimal circulation, and it does not focus on local content. All weeklies in the Sherman, Texas market are controlled by us, though there is some weekly competition in outlying Texas and Oklahoma communities. Our publication, the Herald Democrat also competes with local TV stations and several locally-owned radio stations in the market.
In Arkansas, there is some minor competition from the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in northern Crawford county, Arkansas, but they have limited circulation in the Fort Smith market, as well as limited news coverage. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette circulates in the market with our publication, The Pine Bluff Commercial, but does not deliver the community coverage that is most relevant to Pine Bluff and the surrounding counties. This makes our publication the most relevant news source in the area. There are several locally-owned radio stations in the market that also compete with The Pine Bluff Commercial.
In the northern regions of this group, we control every local weekly and daily paper in Story county, Iowa and have weeklies in other neighboring counties, which is why we believe our publications are the leading news source in the area. The principal print competition is the Des Moines Register, but it does not deliver meaningful local community content.
The San Joaquin Media Group, with its flagship, The Record, is the leading local news source in Stockton; there is significant competition for print and digital dollars. In the county, competition comes from three community newspapers, each within 10 miles of Stockton, as well as The Sacramento Bee and Modesto Bee with smaller distribution in the county. Additionally, there are two successful glossy monthly magazines, a business journal, Red Plum (Valassis), Lincoln Center Chronicle monthly and billboards everywhere.
While there is tougher competition in larger markets as compared to the smaller markets across the Western US, the strength of each of these groups comes from being local and having built trusted relationships over the last 100 years. None of our competitors have proven to be significant. Our publications and websites have a rich history in our markets which we believe uniquely positions them for unmatched reach and relevancy in their local audiences.
BridgeTower.  Across the Business and Legal groups, we believe the majority of BridgeTower titles are the leading information provider within their respective niche, and many of our brands face no direct competition. In Baltimore and Minneapolis, we contend with business journals run by American City Business Journals, part of Advance Publications Inc. In states like Pennsylvania, we straddle counties that are covered by other business media but are the leading business brands in Lehigh Valley and Central PA. Our monthly magazine Pet Age, geared toward pet store owners, competes with Pet Business and Pet Product News.
In the legal space, we coexist and partner with state bar associations but otherwise face limited direct local competition. ALM continues to be the largest media company covering attorneys, but BridgeTower and ALM’s regional brands operate in separate regions. We believe Best Companies Group maintains the highest market share within the employee satisfaction research vertical, which includes Great Place to Work Institute and Workplace Dynamics.
Employees
23

As of December 31, 2017, we employed 10,516 employees. We employ union personnel at a number of our core publications representing 1,194 employees. As of December 31, 2017, there were 37 collective bargaining agreements covering union personnel. Most of our unionized employees work under collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2018. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good, and we have had no work stoppages at any of our publications.
Environmental Matters
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations, but has been accomplished to date without having a material adverse effect on its operations. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to us and insurance procured with respect to certain environmental matters, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our operations involve risks in these areas, however, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
