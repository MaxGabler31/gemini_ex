ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
Our Mission
 
Our mission is to create value for our shareholders through innovative products of the high-power density and energy efficiency in the power conversion technology sector.
 
Overview
 
King Resources, Inc. is a holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in the development of smart power supply solutions and products. We operate our business through our wholly owned subsidiary Powertech Corporation Limited (“Powertech Corp”). Powertech Corp commenced operation in Hong Kong on January 21, 2015 and sold our products primarily in Asia. We are not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. The holding company of Powertech Corp, Powertech Management Limited (“Powertech”) was organized as a private limited liability company on December 3, 2021, in British Virgin Islands. We acquired Powertech on December 15, 2021.
 
Our corporate organization chart is as below:

We currently operate in Hong Kong, and we seek to expand distribution of our products into Asia Pacific (“APAC”), and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) markets as opportunities permit. Our products are currently manufactured in China on a purchase order basis. As our distribution increases, we expect to manufacture our products elsewhere in Asia as pricing and logistics dictate. We have no intention of expanding operations or our physical presence into China at this time. Please see “Item 1. Business – Sales and Marketing” for more information. 
 
We are not a Chinese operating company but a Delaware holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Our Hong Kong subsidiary is currently not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions would likely cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
 
There may be prominent risks associated with our operations being in Hong Kong and future operations in China. For example, as a U.S.-listed Hong Kong public company, we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the Data Security Law, and recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government such as those related to the use of variable interest entities, data security and anti-monopoly concerns, may target the Company's corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement, The business of our subsidiary are not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that: (i) our products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations.. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China.”
 
We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.

We generated revenue of $385,406 and $77,389 for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We reported a net loss of $60,166 and $133,331 for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had current assets of $91,269 and current liabilities of $1,887,152 as of March 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2021, our current assets and current liabilities were $107,492 and $1,844,578, respectively. We have prepared our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. 
 
Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of the foregoing. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.
 
History and Development of the Company 
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 8, 1995, under the name ARXA International Energy, Inc. On June 4, 2001, we changed our name to King Resources, Inc., our current name.
 
The Company began filing periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 1996. On June 12, 2009, it filed a notice of termination of registration on Form 15(d) suspending its duty to file reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In December 2010, the Company began posting periodic reports on the OTCMarkets website under the alternative reporting standard, its current reporting standard.
 
On April 2, 2018, a change of control occurred with respect to the Company to better reflect its new business direction. On October 18, 2018, Brian Kistler, the then sole director and executive resigned from his position as the Chairman of the Board, Junrong Yin was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by his resignation. On May 3, 2021, Mr. Kistler resigned from his positions as CEO with the Company and appointed Caren Currier to fill the vacancies caused by his resignation.
 
On October 25, 2021, Caren Currier entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Lee Ying Chiu Herbert pursuant to which Ms. Currier agreed to sell to Dr. Lee all 30 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company held by her for aggregate consideration of Four Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($410,000). This transaction consummated on November 10, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, Ms. Currier resigned from all her positions with the Company and the following persons were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names:

Acquisition of Powertech
 
On December 15, 2021, we acquired 50,000 shares of Powertech Management Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Powertech”), representing all of its issued and outstanding securities, from its shareholders Silver Bloom Properties Limited and FU Wah in exchange for 2,835,820,896 shares of our Common Stock. In connection with the acquisition, each of Silver Bloom Properties Limited and FU Wah received 2,126,865,672 and 708,955,224 shares of our Common Stock, respectively. Powertech operates its smart power supply business through its wholly owned subsidiary Powertech Corporation Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Hong Kong. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of Powertech.
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company was considered as a shell company due to its nominal assets and limited operation. The transaction was treated as a recapitalization of the Company.
 
The Share Exchange between the Company and Powertech on December 15, 2021, is deemed a merger of entities under common control for which FU Wah is the common director and shareholder of both the Company and Powertech. Under the guidance in ASC 805 for transactions between entities under common control, the assets, liabilities and results of operations, are recognized at their carrying amounts on the date of the Share Transfer, which required the retrospective combination of the Company and Powertech for all periods presented.
 
As a result of our acquisition of Powertech, we entered into the smart power supply business. We intend to make additional acquisitions in the same industry and hope to increase distribution of our products into other territories. We also hope to make opportunistic acquisitions in other industries in the future, regardless of whether such industries relate to the smart power supply business.
 
Our Business
 
We operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary Powertech Corporation Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Hong Kong. We currently provide solutions for other companies who are in the fields of developing high power, high voltage power supply and wireless charging technologies. We are currently preparing trial sales of our 65W AC-DC Type C PD chargers, USB-C multiport hub, USB-C mini hub, 65W power bank with 30,000mAh and other accessories through our online store.
 
With the explosive growth of consumer electronic products, the demands of both the size and the weight of brilliant electronic products are increasingly high, including the power charger. However, the conventional power topology scheme and power components, such as MOSFET, Driver, magnetic core materials, etc., cannot meet the need to size down the development of power supplies. We believe that the GaN-based technology will allow us to develop products meeting the demand of smaller sized, high voltage and ultra-high frequency products.
 
We are committed to the development of GaN-based applications as well as research and development of smart new power conversion technologies. In recent years, with the significant increase in demand for small power chargers, energy efficiency and power density have become the focus of the markets. There is an increasing demand of modern electronic product consumers to push for DC/DC and AC/DC power chargers with more efficient energy consumption and higher power density. The main purpose of the power charger is to reduce the energy loss and increase the switching frequency of the converter, in order to manufacture a high-efficiency, energy-saving, and high-power density converter.
 
The range of operating frequency for most power chargers currently in the market is about 10-1000KHz. Our power chargers are designed for isolated converters with operating frequencies in the range of 1-30MHz. We have merged the core planar transformers with a power range of 5-240W, so the power charger frequency is about 500 times of the other power charger frequency in the market. In order to further improve the energy efficiency of the converter, we incorporated high-end power conversion technology with new material equipment into the design, therefore, the energy efficiency is improved by about 8-10% compared with other similar devices.

Insurance
 
We maintain certain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices in Hong Kong. Under Hong Kong law, there is a requirement that all employers in the city must purchase Employee's Compensation Insurance to cover their liability in the event that their staff suffers an injury or illness during the normal course of their work. We maintain Employee’s Compensation Insurance, office insurance and third-party risks insurance for its business purposes.
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Our principal executive and registered offices are located at Unit 1813, 18/F, Fo Tan Industrial Centre, 26-28 Au Pui Wan Street, Fo Tan, Hong Kong, telephone number +852 3585 8905.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
In addition, the laws of Hong Kong and the PRC may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and in the future, China, where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. Currently, we have registered two trademarks in each of the United States of America, Japan and Hong Kong, respectively. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
Powertech’s products are developed and designed in accordance with its proprietary transformer design and control algorithm. This intellectual property is the Company’s trade secret and not covered by a patent.

COMPETITION
 
The consumer electronics industry is dynamic and competitive. Personal portable devices such as laptop computers, tablets, smart phones and wearable devices are becoming essential to our daily life. These portable devices are more powerful, lighter in weight and more compactable in size. However, the power chargers have not made any significant improvements. In recent years, power devices have become more essential to service such portable devices. There are only few potential and existing competitors in the compact power device market, such as Finsix, Nexgen and Delta.
 
Our competitors’ scales are substantially larger than us and have significantly better financial, technical and marketing resources. They have adequate resources to support further development and promotion for their products. We hope to compete based upon our technology advancement and competency, as well as our product design and specification.
 
Our strengths:
 

· | Extensive R&D experiences and practical expertise in power conversion, radio frequency and supply chain management knowledge. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Patents and serval in-house technologies, such as Planar Transformer, ultra-high frequency, GaN utilization that supports high voltage and high switching frequency.
· | Innovative heat dissipation for PCB design, high speed charging. 
· | Highest power density and light weight 
· | Hong Kong based corporation which has a favorable geographic benefit to cover most of the APAC markets. 

 
Our competitive landscape may be significantly altered if new testing technology is introduced into the market by third parties. We may face some prospective competitors, who have greater financial resources, broader product and service offerings, longer operating histories, larger customer base and greater brand recognition, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which will enable them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily when we expand to overseas markets. We believe that we are competitive on factors, including business model, operational capabilities, pricing and service quality.
 
EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS
 
We have the following full-time employees and consultants located at Hong Kong and the PRC as set forth below:

Privacy and Protection of User Data
 
We and subsidiaries are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in the countries where we operate. Our business will involve the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.
Hong Kong
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.
 
An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) Schemes Ordinance, (CAP. 485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll for both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age into an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are $899 and $3,854, respectively.
 
China
 
Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to KRFG.
 
PRC Regulations on Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
The EIT Law of the People’s Republic of China was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.

The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.
 
In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.
 
Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.
 
In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.
 
On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.

PRC Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 
 
General Administration of Foreign Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, Renminbi is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13
 
Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.
 
If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.
 
Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.
 
We cannot assure that our PRC beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.

Circular 19 and Circular 16
 
Circular 19 was promulgated by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.
 
Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:
 

· | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.
 
PRC subsidiaries' distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.
 
PRC Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.

Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.

A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
